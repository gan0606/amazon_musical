Ive been using the DAddario strings for about 10 years now US steel US made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings little known fact in the industry Their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry After 40plus years of playing DAddario Rocks THE ONLY STRING FOR ME,positive
I ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church It was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews I found it to be excellent for the price and so far have had no problems with the zippersThis product is described as a Soprano Ukulele Gig Bag and that is exactly what it is A gig bag is not a rigid FAAapproved flight case nor is it a semirigid polystyrene case with soft covering Reviewers that dont believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a gig bag and dont understand the term You wouldnt put your reading glasses in a soft padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would youI dont know if some other reviewers tried to fit concertsized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag but I found that it fits the soprano size perfectly It is very well padded for a gig bag having extra padding at the base of the instrument where the bottom strap button would be if you have one to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end It also has a nicely padded handle I received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well Ukulele not included They cost a little more than this Very Nice Padded Gig Bag,positive
This is a good budget uke Im not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish This one has better tone and projection than some of the ones Ive played in stores I havent tested it with scientific instruments or anything but I have a good ear former professional tuba player current music teacher enthusiastic amateur guitarist and the chords sound nice and in tune to me The tuners are cheap but they are geared which is nice and it stays in tune decently Its not the Stradivarius of ukuleles the finish is pretty bland and the sound is not exactly a revolution I have used it to teach a class for teachers on using music in their classrooms and it performed well My experience with offshore budget instruments leads me to believe that quality control may be spotty but I only have the one and it is good It is neck heavy but they all are in my experience and it seems pretty sturdy although Ive been very gentle with it About what youd expect,positive
Useful for connecting mics to a guitar amp or directly into a computers mic jack The 14 side tends to become a bit loose after a while not sure if it affects performance though Handy,positive
My guitars largely stay at home so they dont require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more and also take up about twice as much room which is problematic for storing multiple instruments In most cases a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs and costs about 14 of the price of a hard caseI bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles which is a cool touch The case fits my FenderSquier Strat guitars or other guitars of a similar size snugly There is not a ton of padding but more than you might think from the pictures especially on top The pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps I cant say that the zippers will withstand years of use but for most uses they should do just fine Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars Offers enough basic protection at an affordable price,positive
This treatment after I let it soak in for 24 hours made my fingerboard look great and play fast A little goes a long way Just what I was looking for,positive
Comes with AdapterThis thing controls your tone so wellEverything about it is just so much worth the money im starting to fall in love with MXR Best thing since sliced wrists,positive
Excelent product great quality and useful in many different ways I specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing since it can record up to 40 seconds and it will not end unless you stop it this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos I also have it connected in a FXs loop with the Mustang fender IV and it works just perfect in stereo mode the reverse mode rocks allows you to do great fading delay violing efect this is simply the best pedal I got since its so versatile I do play Metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ Love it Great Product,positive
are hard to beat when it comes to durability except the steel ones I use it when I travel on a plane especially These cases,positive
Its an excellent pedal well designed perfect sizeincredible quality if you are looking for a U2 delays stile it is perfect for you Excellent Pedal,positive
Great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks It does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice It does not take up much room it sure feels good to have extra picks close by so that you do not have to scramble to find another one Dunlop,positive
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things good mic,positive
This is a very good piece of equipment for its price Used mildly it gives the sound a more natural feel Very good for the price,positive

The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it It Does The Job Well,positive
A lot of people like the Metal Muff over this and say you can dial in more distortion sounds Well I have both The Muff is good for various tones but the MXR gives you that all out full metal tone Having the built in gate is also nice and it works The Muff is a lot more noisy But I like em both I just use them for different tones If you want that full out metal tone get this trust me An awesome pedal,positive
This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone sounds like a 1980s video game beep but I am just being picky I bought this for my son and he loves it Good Tuner and Metronome,positive
i got it i played for a very while and i just got shocked with a great sound great finished guitar and for the price definitely was a Great Deal i play rock n roll im 34been on the road for a while playin and i can recommended for sure Great Deal,positive
thankfully i still have most of these picks im always losing them but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on great picks,positive
Like many guitar players I have a few effects pedals of different brands and I needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them At one of the guitar forums I frequent I started a thread about powering a TS9 Tube Screamer with a nonproprietary nine volt power supply One Spot came back twice in the replies Since that time I acquired a two more pedals so now I really needed something I looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me I got creative I ordered a One Spot Combo Pack then bought some 2 wide industrial strength Velcro and built my own board that fits in my hardshell brief caseSo far so good after two months of band practices the One Spot 9V DC adapter with the Multi Plug daisy chain cable does what I bought it for my little four pedal setup works beautifully Im perfectly happy it The One Spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source The Combo Pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the Multi Plug daisy chainIf you are thinking about buying this product do it If you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chartPower to the pedals Rock On One Spot is Spot On,positive
The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros Ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only 40 so why not The first thing i learned about this pedal is It does what its suppose to do but with some drawbacks There is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser youd be up the creek Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does fuzz things then thats why I give it 4 stars I deduct 1 star because the loud feedback But in the long run I would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative Iffy,positive
At this price how can you go wrongComfortable and sturdyWorks just fine thank youBought another for my Strat Works just fine,positive
There is almost no difference between this and the Snark SN1 and by that I mean the design flaws You have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading and they eat batteries like crazy The Snark SN8 is far superior Snark makes better tuners than this,negative
This bag is made well enough If you are careful it offers good protection You cant rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly cant stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc If your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag otherwise its a good bag especially at this price All you need if youre careful,positive
34Quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations Great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price Sounds good and the action is smooth34 Great beginner banjo that wont break the bank,positive
Korg GA1 Guitar and Bass Tuner is a very good and helpful tool to any guitar playerBuy it you will never regret Korg GA1 Guitar and Bass Tuner,positive
This string winder is adequate but not really solid It gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft I had to glue the contacts on this thing since it gives way at times This is just adequate for my use Adequate,neutral
I just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home It does the job well If youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect Many adjustments to get just the right position Its definitely not a performance mic as it does feel a bit filmsy but you wont notice the flimsiness except for when youre adjusting it Adjusting it is a tad tedious but you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutesIve mounted my Samson Q1U Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone to it It works well for sure Then I attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over Make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension or it will tip over if theres too much weight Just find something semi heavy and find a way to attached it to the existing counterweight and it will be excellent So this mic wont play nice with your large condensers pop filters shockmount at the start but just find a good counter weight and all will be wellIt looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room It was a good investment and all in all you definitely get what you pay for If youre hesitant on attaching a lot of stuff to it then I would recommend shelling out a couple more dollars for a sturdier standBut atleast for me it does the job and does it well Great stand but the the counterweight could be heavier,positive
Definitely worth the 40 If you are looking for a literal octave pedal this aint it This is a good old school fuzz monster and when combinations of notes are played most notably an interval of a 4th on the lower strings it creates an overtone series that has a subtle octving effect Ive used this pedal to put some growl in my bass kind of an EH Bass Balls sound Awesome,positive
This is my first experience with a high end guitar cord after playing for longer than Id like to admit For many years ive been playing with any old shielded solid core cord without regard for much besides price In prep for an upcoming gig I bought 2 Spectraflex Fatso 18 right angle cords I find them to be very well made with shrink tubing sealed strain reliefs at the high quality plugs thick and heavy duty cabling but not too think nor too heavy and best of all very quiet presumably because of superior shielding They were what I consider expensive about 38 each but for me well worth the price and considerably less than many other high end cables I found and read about I imagine that they will last for years I think I will eventually replace all my dozen or so cords of various lengths with theseJM Tepper Quiet solid and attractive,positive
I have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100 I have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and I also have some cheapies Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the Cheapies Ive been dealing with Musicians friend forever Rogue is Musicians Friends brand Music 123 is a Musicians Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars I have several different models of Rogue guitars and Im impressed with all of them The Rogue RA090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster Heres the good part the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one Once they realize its not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingersthey quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten If youre not sure if youre serious about learning to play this is the guitar for you Even if youre an intermediate to advanced player you still cant go wrong with this guitar It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument The finish and workmanship is also like what youd find on a more expensive guitar They look play and sound great Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price They figure a guitar that cheap cant be much good Thats where theyre wrong You have to actually play one to understand what Im talking about Once you play a Rogue guitar you too will become a believer This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire If it happens to get damaged or stolen youre not out an arm and a leg I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality The Rogue RA090 comes in a variety of color choices If or when you decide to sell it you can usually get back what you paid for itI give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one Ive been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what Im talking about I do not own stock in Musicians Friend Music 123 or Rogue guitars and I dont get paid to endorse them This review is my honest opinion Bang for your buck,positive
i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp it works really well having the two different style of ends gives you good options when putting a system together Great Patch Cable,positive
I really like this cable It is a great quality cord that is very durable and I think it would be a long time before I would need another one The length is long enough for any need and the cable will obviously be around for a while great guitar cable,positive
sounds great Love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks It does not work well with a daisy chain power supply with this set up the second channel will distort a bit Forget batteries They last 510 minutes With its own power supply sounds amazing esp when one takes in to consideration the price nice sounding reverb with a few quirks,positive
I always seem to have to retune with the spring loaded capos Rarely have to re tune with this one Highly recommend Love it,positive
Nice bag with great features It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for eitherI actually swapped another bag putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR headstock World Tour EG20D Deluxe 20mm Electric Guitar Gig Bag,positive
This has come in handy many times in my studio Z108net We love having it around Good quality affordable price A quality adapter,positive
The Fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new The great part about it is the design The fact that it is wide enough to run along all six strings is a definite plus The things I dont like about it is the top does not close tight enough and can come off during any kind of travel Once the top is off or just not closed properly the pad dries out and then it is useless Also the little cloth that comes with it is almost impossible to fit back inside the container once you have opened it As stated it was really good at cleaning and was easy to use but I was only able to use it once because the top came off and it dried out Unfortunately because of that I would not recommend this item Go with the Fast Fret Satisfactory,neutral
does really good with a fairly heavy microphone adjustments stay in place without constantly tightening works exactly as it should Tripod microphone stand,positive
Very sturdy stand suitable for stage use This stand even accommodates a double neck Its not very compact when folded but Im still giving it 5 stars Sturdy and easily folds,positive
I gave this product 5 stars simply because it did exactly what I bought it to do reduce unwanted noise to my amp You will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to It doesnt cut noise while your playing but when your not it comes on a kills the noise There are two lights on the pedal one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise If you have it set to high or to sensitive it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise So play with it and find your personal setting because Im sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp The NR300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you you will be happy with it Oh and if you switch it to Mute it works as an on and off switch You also can not beat the price adding a noise reducing pedal to my effects chain,positive
These are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion They play extremely well and last a Long time Theres nothing better than these strings Two words THE BEST,positive
Monster Cable is one of the things on earth we can count onSeriously speaking all my cables are Monsters yes they are pricy and sometimes very much trueBut they last really lifetime and I never ever had to complain or heard a friend complaining on Monster productsPEACE GREAT,positive
This tuner can be adjusted to be very easy to see when you tune your instrumentIt senses the vibrations of the string through the neck and head so the sounds of other instruments do not effect the tuningVery light so I leave it on when I playand it turns itself off when I forget so it doesnt unnecessarily drain the batteriesInexpensive so can afford three one for a banjo one for a bass and one for a guitar to keep in each instruments case It works,positive
This is one of the best pedals I have on my board I originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this I was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect which can be breathtaking The settings are all quite useful Church plate spring hall room gate etc and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay There is also a toneprint setting which is nice but honestly the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound the toneprint seems redundant I leave this pedal on most of the time along with my Corona chorus and Flashback delay It is part of 34my sound34 One of the most useful pedals I own surprisingly,positive
This product does what you want and is easy to take on and off Definitely a great value for the money Does the job,positive
Ill be brief and to the point here Works as an audio interface for a line level signal I used this with my Samson mixer Is compact and the USB cable itself is long enough The red color looks nice Has a headphone out with volume control Plug and play No extra drivers needed I use ASIO anyways Cheap Theres NO audio interface this affordable Latency fairly low Not bad Plastic body RCA connectors Not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono14 inch 441 khz and 16 bit sampling Should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz Even my DigiTech RP255 has a built in 24bit audio interface Does the Job 16 Bit though with RCA Connectors,positive
Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed Never owned an OCD but I dont need to My neighbors Im sure are not pleased Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point Its your guitar on steriods Crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it Thats at the 25 gain setting Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered HARD NOT TO GO BALLS OUT,positive
These fit snug on my Shure SM58 Beta A mics Nice texture and it doesnt affect the sound of my micsI recommend em Snug Fit,positive
Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply Want a 5 channel system buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one No noise or hum Has both trs and xlr inputs has a knob for gain control on back Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces There is however no mounting point no captive nuts or suchYoull need to adopt a philosophy on gain You can crank the speaker gain to 100 and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the 15 to 6 dB0 range It may be a tad loud in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50 power approximatelyYou could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with 6 dB0 off the mixerHaving a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolationMy FIRST nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have I will have to fabricate some protection My second nitpick is i owned the smaller maudio 4 monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left ie not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer The speaker w 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it It was not the power supply as being on made the box warm but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with 3dB0 into the trs line in Thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicerI do like this set of speakers From stereo to 51 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs I may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already Sweet sound differential xlr input true biamp speakers,positive
Especially for the price this is a great buy The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that arent shining like they use to I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it inoff as thoroughly as possible which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever Take 1015 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor Glad I made the purchase,positive
Ill start this by saying I prefer metal slides to glass tone snob that I amSo I wasnt too excited about playing with this until I played with itThe tone is amazingGreat highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonicsI now only use metal slides And my dunlop bottleneck Great harmonics,positive
I lost my trusty slide and really miss it The Dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but it does sound sweet If it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick My old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so a brandnew sleek fit isnt a plus in my case The Dunlop is well made as expected Its just not the Antiques Roadshow model I had in mind Hmmm might be a new product idea rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name Almost What I Was Looking For,positive
Id bought this thing several years agoforget whereas an alternative to the ElectroHarmonics Stone Phaser The EH Stone is great but a couldnt afford it 2the adapter input is proprietary differnt than was on my Boss pedal board3wasnt gigging out So I figured What the heckIve had fun with it With a wah and a proper guitar sound one can easily emulate the HendrixishUnivibe sound Remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor Also its a Vintage Style not a mid 80s mosquito tone killing device Not a huge range here No swooshing jet sounds Just good ol wobbleIll agree with the other guy here and say the durability is questionable and the size of the thing is annoying by comparison to the standard pedal housing And it does make some noise in my chain Lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteriesA tinkererhobbyistmodder may enjoy getting a sturdy pedal housing box and putting this things guts into it and getting a sturdy switch Paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal Behringer Vint Phaser,positive
Ernie Ball is the standard for guitar strings I tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the GHS boomers and DAddario I have to say I only had a pack of Slinky Strings during my last setup and Im glad thats what I used because they play great and sound amazing Standard,positive
These EXL115 011 gauge DAddarios are good strings at a good price They sound nice and bright on my Epiphone Sheraton II and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale which I like Id rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time The strings dont break either Good strings at a good price,positive
Very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well Exactly as described in the ad Nice Soft Guitar Case,positive
The first power source that is fun It can take the edge off of a distortion of OD pedal by rolling off the voltage I have yet to use it with a fuzz but I hear it sound sick fun power source,positive
I have been online shopping banjos quite extensively Ebay Amazon 3 dozen online shops reviews from multitude of sources investigating manufacturer home sites etc I did the same for this banjo and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo I still felt very comfortable with what little I put together information wise And frankly at this price it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget sometimes you just cant afford 400 dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand Additionally mine came very well setup from the seller aside from the inevitable tuning And its purty too I would also deeply recommendSnark SN2 All Instrument ClipOn Chromatic Tuner absolutely the best tuner I have ever used and makes the various banjotuning schemes a breezeBe aware in order to avoid possible confusion Jameson Guitars is actually a subbrand of Davison Guitars so if you order and look at your peghead and it says Davison like mine does and not RW Jameson its the same maker yes I examined Davisons home site as well as the Amazon Sellers Solid Bluegrass Banjo,positive
This is hands down the best guitar stand on the market It will last a lifetime and never drop your axe I have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and I love them all Best guitar stand Period,positive
This strap has a fantastic oldschool look and vibe and Ive never had it slip off while playing The only downside is that its a bit rough on any loose skin I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose tshirt For 99 of situations these strap rocks Looks great stays on but might be a little rough on skin,positive
I was hesitant to purchase this as I really like the display of the previous models At first it seems like it might be less accurate It has less granularity in the display for example However it does seem to respond noticeably faster It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes And it may in fact be more precise though it takes learning how to work with the displayOn earlier Snarks the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note And they seemed pretty dead on especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to overtune Though once you get used to it it is easily avoidedAnyway on this unit I am not sure what each bar represents but it is very sensitive If the string is not quite perfect the On pitch bar will be lit up but so will one next to it Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on Then only the On pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far And the result sounds really right Subtly Better than Previous Snarks,positive
These work greatFor the price I bought a couple intending to use them on a diddley bow I builtI have not used them for that purpose yet but tried them on my guitars a dulcimer and stick I built and was impressed with the sound quality for the price great,positive
This is a nice strap It feels really durable I like the black side and the soft leather side It feels good around my shoulders I dig this,positive
this stand is VERY GOOD nice and strong i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars this will last a life time and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easilyi was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash so i looked for something better and i am so happy to have found this at this pricei didnt want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash i would be buying another one so really this is the BEST DEAL i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you cant go wrong with this oneREALY get it it will hold a few books and stand should not tip overits heavy enough not to it slides up and down nicely and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well bolts are NOT plasticwitch is niceand very easy to put together and fasti got it together in one minutei only used regular pliers to put it together the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrumenti truly recommend this for anyone i did get the foot guards for 195 to protect floor on carpet you will not need them and it comes with a 10 year warranty and with the free shipping you cant beet it very good stand WOW 29 ONLY THANKS,positive

There are several types of practice amps High end modlers Line 6 G Dec Vox VT that can still run 400 and are typically overloaded with features The low end tubes Fender Blues Junior Bug V22 Peavey Valveking etc These typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality And then there are the micros I always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at ChristmasBoy was I wrongI needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear Hes not a big kid so even 15lb amps are pushing itplus a gig bag and school back pack That was initially what brought me to the Micro Not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso Turns out this is an AMAZING amp The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder 6watt or Bug V12 And the Fender frontman not even in the ballparkEach of the models are distinct The cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate Obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes It also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously For example I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracyDont let the size fool you I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldnt have been more wrong There are several big websites and its tough to find any negatives about this amp Quality sounding and durable for a great priceOh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too For the price an easy 5 stars,positive
The Line 6 POD HD500 has toomuch compression even with the compression effect turned off If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound then I recommend getting the BOSS GT10 and installing BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg Search Google for BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg TooMuch Compression Even With The Compression Effect Turned Off,neutral

When I plugged this into my computer and keyboard it said one MIDI device detected but I was not getting sounds from my piano onto my computer I simple took the MIDI in and the MIDI out and switched them and the problem was instantly solved If your MIDI is not working right try what I did switching the cables to the opposite side Sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time D Drove me crazy until I figured it out,positive
If you are looking to walk around while you play your guitar then you might want to look into something longer As a spare cable to play at home though its pretty good Spare cable,positive
This is an all metal exc for the adjusting screw stand fullsizedfor 20 bucks Exceptional value What mores to say Great,positive
Ive used DAddario strings for a long time been playing 20yrs and have always been satisfied with their tone The balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension Do I fully understand how this works nope but they sure do sound good Their feel is a little more snappy than regular XLs in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well Their sound is bright just like their XL cousins I think its more of a feel thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings Now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instrumentsAll in all a great product that I recommend to any electric guitarist Great Strings,positive
Ive been using Slinky regular nickels for over 20 years on my electrics and love them Ive tried various coated strings etc but always come back to Ernie for sound and value But on my acoustics its been DAddario J16s since day one and still is Never had one bad set out of over a hundred I adore the sound and the reliabilitySo why have I never tried their egit strings Because the Slinkys are perfect But I must say so are these I just put a set of 10s on one of my Strats and they are as snappy yet nottoobright as I could want They really complement the single coil tones especially the 2 and 4 outofphase positions so if youre a Strat fan and love that tone give these a shotOne thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are A few inches longer than most electric strings in fact No idea why but if you have huge posts and like megawraps heres your puppy I only do a triple wrap max so its just more to cut but hardly an issueAnd no matter what the coated string fans say those might stay clean longer but that brandnewstring ZING only lasts a few hours on any string coated or not So if youre recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones or playing big gigs where tone is everything I say stick with uncoated strings and aside from Slinkys these are the best Ive played Typically superb DAddario quality bright and musical,positive
For the multi guitar owners I think this is greatAll I was looking for something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tonevolume changesSet up single coil and another line humbucker or p90 guitar and have the same volumes Excellent And space saver Sure theres a lot more options but not likely ill use just to make guitar switching easy good deal Guitar,positive
this is the 2nd tuner like this that I have purchased it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar the battery lasts a long time as well which is not true with all little tuners like this one all in all I am very happy with this purchase small price to pay to be in tune I would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument Great Tuner Great Price gets the job done well,positive
Nothing special Just like every other strap of its kind I compared it to other poly straps I have and its OK No better and no worse Price was good It took a long time to come Leather ends seem OK I mention that because it appears to be the main complaintIm using it as a spare so it should be OK Im a little disappointed Im used to a higher quality from EB products It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone I dont perform a lot of antics on stage its just me and the axe I dont expect any problems Hope this helps Small 34thumbs up34 to Amazon Nothing Special,neutral
Fender Medium my favorite guitar pick a dozen should last a while right When these slip away Ill order more My Favorite picks,positive
Schaller is sort of a household name among guitarists because theyve been making the same product for so long now You probably already know what this thing is and what it does All my electric guitars are equipped with these The industry standard strap retention system,positive
I had purchased this cord and a 25 cord for an assignment I was going on I had previously bought a shorter cord that just didnt fit tight enough into the mic This one and the other one I bought were really a great well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should I would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon Great product Fast Service Crazy Low Price,positive
I like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere I use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar The right angle is nice because its low profile and fits perfectly on my board even when I put it in its travel case Everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem Great cable hard to tangle,positive
Came in time worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic As an advice to every one using a mic whether it is a regular or condenser mic always use this protection on the mic to avoid the body fluids getting inside grill and on to diaphragm This is worth the investment for your expensive mic FITS PERFECT,positive

Just be aware that the ends are so big that some vertical input boxes like my Danelectro Fish and Chips cant be used with these cables because the input and output are too close together They work,positive
I was using my iPhone and line 6 input but having to plug in can be a drag when youre no where near your gear But hands down this is the most accurate easy to use and most portable tuner ever I use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc I bought two more you will love this tuner Best tuner Ive ever ownedperiod,positive
Great price but very fragile Im a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables The end separated from the cable not very good quality would not buy this brand again Worked for a while,positive
This was very convenient easy to use weighs next to nothing and takes even less space than I had expected Recommended Well thought out and very convenient,positive
I bought this for my Sigma DMC15E it allows my guitar to hang better than the lasso type headstock straps and looks much better they leather is very high quality and is very supple Works great,positive
I was not to thrill about this product I really dont have anything super negative to say but nothing super positive either This okay,neutral
I have an Acoustic B100 MKII 100 watt bass amp with a 15 inch speaker My bass is an SX jazz bass I have always loved the tone of my Acoustic amp until now After I plugged this little bad boy in it brought my amp to life Now I cannot live without it This is the Swiss army knife of bass preamps Every bass player should have one of these You can dial in tons of different tones and it gives your amp that tubelike sound For 29 bones you simply cannot beat it Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the Behringer 9V power supply so you dont have to worry about batteries If you are a bass player just buy it Where Have You Been,positive
Well without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes usually in the lower octaves are a little off With cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised This tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes The fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars Highly recommended And it looks great too Yep works even on a flute,positive
I wish there was a fine pivotangle adjustment to orient harp to mouth I feel I have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how I set it up I have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as I think I need it to causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth LOL This is the least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013 Since it was inexpensive comparatively I will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews dont want itAlso not sure why they dont make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of Harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design It works but only one pivot point and I am inexperienced,positive
Very handy to have Could peel paper off bottom and stick to guitar or something to keep your picks close at hand I havent done that myself as I dont want to mess up the finish of my guitar but could see it being handy Picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed Works well,positive
This gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique Definitely far superior to any of the other gig bags that Iv ordered for tenor and baritone Uke in this price range So good that I bought a 2nd for my son,positive
This pedal has tone its very easy to use and program I did not have idea on how to use it and really quick I got it it has a great interface it sounds great you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no timeThe distrosion is great some people say they arent but I really love them its a matter of taste and creating your tones some preset may not be good for youThe downside it does not have the AC adapter but I knew thisThe lights under certain light conditions are very brightBut this pedal is note heavy well constructed and sturdy I got the AC adapter so I dont have to be on the batteries all the timeThis pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans Great Pedal easy to use and learn,positive
I purchased this for my daughter who is 10 She is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar I bought her This bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly I am going to purchase another one for my guitar Great bag,positive
Folks Ive tried them all from Dean Markley to Ernie Ball All have their good and bad points But after 22 years of guitar playing DAddario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money Although I prefer the super light top regular bottom version I have always loved the feel tone and durability of DAddario strings DAddario makes the best,positive
I have lots of friends who play these strings Some love them more than any other string and some are like me Theyre clearly good strings and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips but I cant get past the sound It could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars but in any case Im not happy with the sound and thats why I have a hard time giving them a solid fivestar ratingI tried these on two separate guitars I play regularly and wasnt terribly impressed with the sound on either One is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone and is crisp clear and fairly loud These strings softened the tone which I wasnt looking to do They sound okay but nowhere near as good as the Martin SPs I use to really bring out the best in that guitarI also have a cutaway electricacoustic I use to sing with because its fairly quiet and the softer tones dont drown out my voice These strings made the guitar even more quiet and there was a considerable dropoff in tone quality as well They might have been cheap old strings because I couldnt tell that there was anything special about them This particular guitar didnt have spectacular sound to begin with and these strings did nothing to improve it I like strings to either sound as good as other strings or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar These strings did neither for me However they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an ampBased upon my experimentation I would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and youre not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality youll love the way these strings feel and play I rate them excellent in that category But for me tone is 80 of the equation Id play wirewrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings In the tonal category these strings fell short On a guitar with excellent tone I noticed a distinct drop in tone quality and on another softer more muted guitar tone quality vanishedIn the final analysis if youre a picker and your guitar can be plugged in youll love these strings If youre really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesnt have stellar tone to begin with you might gain some playability but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality Hmmm I like them but with a lot of reservations,neutral
Nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght Nothing else I can say Take it for cheap guitars Good stuff,positive
I lke these strings very much They bend quite a bit and are very easy to use However they tend to come untuned because theyre so susceptible to temperature and humidity Good strings,positive
It is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play Nice,positive
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic I am not sure how they would feel on a heavy electric yes they work,positive
This is a great investment if you are like me and dont want to drill a hole in your guitar to put in a new button It does make the strap long but is suppose to You will have to adjust your strap from the other side All in all this is a great product Great Investment,positive
Its a good product works well and does what its meant to do Im glad I bought it over the other main pop filter as that one has bad reviews Quality for cheap,positive
Do NOT use these to polish your guitar It leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up A total disaster These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything Terrible Leaves little fibers everywhere,negative
Not the same as a MXR so dont get your hopes up on that It is however a great compressor for the money and useful for many applications I find myself using it for bass more than guitar but its great for either Great,positive
I also own Bose Quiet Comfort 15s and AE2s and the Grado S80is these have become my favorites The Grados have tight but somewhat weak bass and amazing but sometimes too shrill and airy mids and highs with a great soundstage both Boses have more pronounced bass than the Grados and good mids and highs but less airy and soundstage than the Grados and the audiotechnicas are in between with the best balance between accurate and pronounced but not excessively bass excellent mids and highs and very good soundstage They have become my favorite phones Though the bass is pronounced it is with an accurate depth and a THUD like a topline subwoofer when the bass drum hits All in all quite a listening experience WOWTHAT SATS IT ALL MY FAVORITE HEADPHONES,positive
I use this to position my iPad a way so that its out of the sightline of the audience but its also great for micing drums Sturdy flexible and well designed Lots of metal where there needs to be metal Buy a few youll be glad you did A musthave for difficult mic placements,positive
I ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago Ultimately theyre simply the best for the money You can get them for less than 3 per pack if you shop around My favorite strings,positive
Elixirs Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings Ive ever used on my Alvarez acoustic a guitar Ive now owned for over 30 years They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there they have a nice punchy tone and are easy on the fingers Unlike the Elixir Extra Lights that I found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a shortscale guitar these seem like an ideal combination I may buy another set soon and restring the shortscale instrument with lights Compared with some brands and gauges of more old school strings there may be a little less bass response but these sound good pretty even through the set and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string The Best Yet,positive
This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized at least you can have one place where you can find a pick as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case but a small baggie will work just as well Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage Sometimes depending on the amount and size of the pick its hard to get the pick out of the holder and if you use something other than the standard shape forget it It has an adhesive backing so I guess you can stick it on your ampguitarwallsmall animal but Id rather not If you like spring loaded coin holders youll like this,neutral
I havent used this mic much yet but so far it has a great sound It is loud and projects the voice out front of the music For 25 bucks I dont think you can beat it Im happy so far I may buy some more of them It is not too short as one reviewer complained It is a standard length just like the SM58 Good Mic for the Money,positive
but I keep thinking it is going to interfere with tuning at the nutwill be trying to get more use in worked good,positive
This tabletop Mic Stand works Well designed and made from descent enough materials I would buy again when Im ready to replace the one I have or add to it Very Good Tabletop Mic Stand,positive
Not much I can add to the review that isnt well covered already Its a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment There are some design flaws that I could see giving some people trouble over time But overall its a great productI just wanted to add that it will work for the HD500X with enough room for all the cablespowersupplies needed for effects pod digital wireless rig HD500X,positive
This gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal Its go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel With mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the soundOn the other side you cant use boost channel without drive channel Versatile overdrive,positive
For the price this is a wonderful strap It can get twisted and wear out but keep it straight and it will last you a long time It has a vintage look very soft and comfortable It also has that vintage Fender coolness factor I have 30 year old leather straps that will be around years after Im gone but I paid a lot for them and theyre not as comfortable as this Ive even used these on Gibsons oh the shame but of course they look best on Fenders I guess The truth is they will work on anything The strap ends are great but theyre not really secure Gaskets can take care of that I own quite a few of these are theyre great quality look cool in a vintage kinda way and feel soft on my shoulder I own many guitar straps for many guitars,positive
If you havent used this stuff and if you plan to play squeakless guitar take the risk Buy some Youll wonder how you ever played without it You might even become the next Joe Satriani gotta have it gotta have it gotta have it,positive
I ordered this as a spare and at this time I havent used it My microphone came with its own cable and this was for a 34What if34 situation I gave it 4 stars on just expectation Havent use it yet,positive
They work great You can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings I use these on an old Gibson semihollow body Nice,positive
Nicely made and wellpadded guitar softcase purchased to protect a Jasmine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar The guitar fit inside the case perfectly and a zippered pocket on the case allows for storage of picks stings and other flat items Very nice product Now THIS is a nice product,positive
I love these cables I ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs They are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day Very very nice and an awesome price,positive
DAddario always comes through for the musician who wants a great product on the cheap Ive used boutique strings for many years but always come back to these Great tone great string life with a little maintenance and very reasonably priced Loved these as a replacement for the Fender Super Bullets that came on my USA Fender Standard Stratocaster Strumma Strumma,positive
This Behringer unit has all the necessary features to give you solid performance in a stompbox delay pedal I say why pay more Why pay more,positive
Good spring action made pretty solid No buzzing on the strings when I put it on The lifetime warranty is what I am stoked about I will probably buy two more for my other guitars Highly recommend it Great,positive
I bought the Mini Tone Master as a practice amp for my Dean EVO electric guitar and love it but there are a few things you should know before a possible purchase1 When they say mini they mean it Its a tiny little thing about the size of a hardcover book or smaller and about as thick 2 thick or so2 It also runs off a 9V battery though if you have a DC9V adapter theres a plug for it it also has a 14 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well3 Its LOUD Even when at low volume its tones will fill a room This is a major plus for such a tiny inexpensive ampControls on the amp are great it has a gaindistortion knob that is almost as good as having an overdrive or gain effects pedal hooked up to a fullsize amp Its strong enough to where if youre playing small gigs such as coffeehouses or holeinthe wall small bars you wont need to lug along your 10W or larger amp with you though that may depend on the tone your guitar puts out to begin with Still this is an awesome deal I paid about 30 here on Amazon for it so if you need a practice amp but dont want to spend a ton of cash snatch up one of these little bad boys You wont be sorry Inexpensive compact and LOUD great little amp,positive
I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money as compared to noncoated brands They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide frictionits sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular stringsthese feel like superflatwound strings meaning they feel smooth I have some nice callusses built up but I imagine that Id like these strings even more if I was just starting out or restarting because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than noncoated strings SlickProbably easier on the fingertips for those without good callusses,positive
I like purchasing the 3 pack because I have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings You cant beat the price I have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way Customer comments,positive
I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments Though I am not a professional musician I find each them to be of equal accuracy In fact the DAddarios compact size and fit is totally unnoticeable and though its screen is micro in size it is very clear and viewable denoting flatsharp notation A great choice for the price Surprisingly accurate,positive
Love the looksit does what I needholds guitarlooks greatpriced rightanyone thinking of one should get itgreat service when ordered strap,positive
I just got it today and havent spent too much time with it yet It sounded OK and I like the features on it I especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal As soon as you press down its on Lots of adjustments so Ill be tweaking for a while to find my sound but it seems like its going to be OK Its a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve For the money Its a great pedal Good Wah pedal for the price,positive
This is what it is A super cheap mono cable It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etcFor the price and intent I almost gave it 5 stars But its not a 5star cable Its a fair quality ultra cheap cable 4 stars seems about right Yes this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed Almost 5Stars for the Price,positive
I tune my guitars ukuleles cavaquinhos and piano with various tuners like the Korg GA40 or Korg CA40 or Korg TM40 and I pair this Korg CM100 Tuner Clip and the difference is huge You no longer have to worry about background noiseI clip it on the headstock of my guitarukecava and it tunes them quite well On the piano I can clip it on any part and it picks up on the tuner It works as well as mostall of the clipon tuners you see on various guitars and ukuleles nowadays but if you have one of the chromatic tuners that dont directly clip on like the Intelli IMT series then this will make it work 100x better okay slightly exaggerated because the ambient noise is not picked up by the tuners microphoneI give this accessory high marks and I highly recommend it A musthave accessory to use with chromatic tuners,positive
I decided to try these open metal finger picks when I could no longer find ProPicks which I really like ProPick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar Compared with the ProPicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal They offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger I find these and the ProPicks for that matter much more natural than conventional picks These actually have some advantages over the old ProPicks 1 you get three finger picks rather than two and 2 because the metal is a heavy gauge they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers It would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that theyre protected in the guitar case however they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well freeranging around in the case Highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar Very Good Finger Picks,positive
This is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88key keyboard The frontback spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the morecommon X stand Good for project studio,positive
This has got to be the best little tuner Ive ever owned and the cheapest too I have a 100 tuner that works nicely but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to The SN2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the SN1 doesnt So I use it on all my instruments except my sitar as theres no place to clip it I highly recommend it Snark SN2 Tuner,positive
Very good strap Fine quality Your guitar will be fixed surely Just one thing that strap is too big for kids So if you choose some kind of mini guitar than youd better to find something else Else this is a really good choise Awesome strap,positive
Sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value I dont require professionallevel equipment so this cord serves my purposes well Satisfied with purchase Does what its supposed to do,positive
received them in four daysjust in time for my first lessonCant say much more than that because I am just beginning lessons and dont really know what to look for yet Super Super Super,positive
This drop clutch is just fantastic I have used them for years and always buy the same model Nothing on the market works as well as this Simple installation and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick It couldnt be easier Best Buy on the Market Whoever Invented this Clutch should be Knighted,positive
I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal Does everything it is supposed to do without the perceived thats was they say volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals If its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off Best tremolo pedal for the money,positive
So I bought these because being Dunlop I trust the brand I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky The only problem I have is they scare the piss out of me Its not a tighten washer and nut situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks These have pegs that insert Its so hard for me to trust these I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip peg fall out and ruin a 500 guitar I havnet had a single problem with this system yet and I never hope that I do But if it happens there will be an update to this Good product so far just wouldnt recommend it There is too much crap in the world to be worried about strap locks shouldnt be one of those things They work fine so far But still scared oo,positive
what part u dont likeyo u can use eq to wash it a bit awayit is quite goodCAN BE QUITE SIBILANCE PRONE so bewareehso for the priceHighly recommendedin these price rangesstick to known brandslike shure ev at etcthen come the newbiesa few models from mxl etc etchave fun typical AT soundquite good,positive
I also have a keeley 4 knob compressor but Im preferring the Xotic pedal right now The compression is more agressive than the keeley but I find it easier to dial in a good sound especially using the blend knob I like to retain some dynamics to my sound The highmidlow switch is great I like it on mid or high really makes the harmonics come out There is more volume on tap as well and I can see how it could also be used as a useful clean boost The Keeley has a more dynamic and transparent sound but I also find its noisier than the Xotic The Xotic is a fraction of the price though and better overall value I think Excellent compressor,positive
This is just what it looks like a very economical strap The great thing about it is the length As any other tall person will tell you finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating This strap is very long if you need it to be For the price very hard to beat this Works well withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System Blacktoo Overall a good buy for a backup strap or your primary Simple easy long strap,positive
I ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try Id been looking for a boom attachment for a nonboom stand because I play guitar and sing This seemed perfect and it is Regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book They can be helpful but also take up too much air space on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces This thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself The other thing I like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock so youre not just tightening a joint and relying on friction as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tiredAnyway no reservations about this one A deadsimple idea that works great A revelation,positive
Easy to use Wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass Little to no excess residue Handy to use package pull the cover off swipe the strings put the cover back on I have not noticed any effect on the tone quality or sustain of my strings Way better than the the popular Competitor,positive
I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks preinstalled Ive used Dunlops before but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass so I just bought the Schaller buttons I dont quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops but theres no question about the quality these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon Very wellmade though not quite my favorite design,positive
This is a great deal for two microphone stands They are well constructed and are very flexible can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand Several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning These should last a long time as long as theyre not abused Two For the Price of One,positive
I needed picks so I ordered an assortment I have been trying different ones I seem to like them all Smooth Transaction,positive
Perfect fit for me I dont like a pick that is to stiff and I like the grip My hands sweat a lot so I really need the grip just my size,positive
I was impressed by the quality of this product It is simple and does its job well Easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or Les Paul or with a thin neck on most metal Guitars Holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise Was a great value Great Capo fits fat to thin necks,positive
Excellent value and you know what It is identical in every way with the Retail store Product Same made in CHINA product with another no name LOGO stuck to it Perfect for the Garage Band Black Friday price without waiting same as my ProLine,positive
Nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time One of my favorite picks Ive tried for electric Dont enjoy them as much on acoustic Great picks,positive
I can see this strap lasting a long time I love how I dont need new strap buttons considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floorYou can lock each strap button with one hand great product Real leather locking strap wo need for new buttons perfect,positive
I suppose it does what it is suppose to do it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if I want to spend more bucks for a better one A Harp,positive
Easy to use I can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background This is definitely more accurate than a persons ear while other instruments are playing Snark is great,positive
Its a nice pice easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar the only matter and its not a big deal is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect Nice,positive
I really like the deluxe bags by fender Plenty of space for stuff good straps and carry options and enough padding to provide as much protection as a soft bag can Great gig bag,positive
Not bad for the price they have it for Multi color and easy to use Durable pick would recomened for you to buy it GREAT,positive
It really nice made in Canada not China wow That alone impressed me Like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material Yes you can bend it It will probably last 2 life times Ends are made of leather One advantage is that once you set it to the appropriate length it will not change easily If your switching to different size guitars this could be a problem cause you cant make an onthefly quick adjustment on stage you will be wrestling with it All Good BUT stiff material,positive
I always wanted a Boomerang III looper which at almost 500 was not really a justifiable expense for me Then I found this for about 100 and I immediately sprung for it This is a great practice tool All it does is make loops The learning curve is very low and theres no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total 5minute recording time There are no quirky timing issues to be found here your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops This does take some getting used to but it makes you a much better musician in the process your drummer and bassist will thank youThis could possibly even be used as a live performance tool although youd have to be very very proficient with this tool and be playing very very tightly in the pocket I personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this lest something go wrong on stage and lest I subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstickStudents would be especially encouraged to get one of these My playing has definitely grown and improved since I finally broke down and bought a looper Great little practice tool,positive
Its tough to shell 85 for a pedal that is not an effect but now that Ive had it for a few weeks Im glad I bought it Although my guitars pretty much stay in tune warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while Im playing them The Boss TU3 is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time When you play in a band you got to have a pedal tuner and you cant go wrong with Boss Glad I Bought it,positive
I have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible It doesnt obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner Great little tuner that doesnt obscure peghead,positive
This is not a top tier condenser mic but it is well worth the 40 dollar price tag It has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch The carrying case is also niceDo not expect this to be MXL or even Behringer B1 quality but its still better than no condenser and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live micing definitely a good value,positive
I dont seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip good,positive
wowso pleased with this 12 microphone packs less of a punch than the Shure SM 58 but works great very happy so far used it to microphone some percussion and it worked great could not really tell the difference from the real thing If it breaksso whatit costs 12 bucks great microphone for someone on a tight budget Highly recommended imitation SM 58but great,positive
For a Fender guitar bullets are the best choice for tone and longevity of strings They seat snug and enhances sustain Quality can be found behind the Fender name Just the string for a Fender guitar,positive
Im a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play I however am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want with as much clarity or with all the 34smoke34 as I feel like dialing in for now It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in put in my ear buds and practice for a while anywhere I want anytime I want Downside I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are smallhard to read but easy to learn You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time Solution Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun This was a good choice Buy one Sounds Great,positive
This capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrumentHighly recommended Just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with Jake,positive
Great for the beginner Five Stars,positive
I wanted to wait till I got another phono preamp before I wrote this review I did get this from AmazonTC 754 BLACK Phono Preamplifier SwitchableI really needed more aux inputs for cd etc But right away I noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright The next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others I am using a vintage Garrard turntable The rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp They are tight but do not make good contact and I need to mess with them This problem is gone with the new preamp Overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues If you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where It does sound ok other than being a little bright It does do what is supposed to do A little to bright,neutral
Piece of plastic with no bracing Due to design will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf which is most quality stands I used doublesided sticky tape problem solved Gives me a place to stow my guitar picks tuner capo and pencil and as such is an invaluable accessory Worth the 6 bucks just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand okay for the price,positive
Nice mic good quality no problems and have used this heavy over the past year Sounds identical to my Shure SM58 but MUCH less Great value,positive
Ive used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity To use these you put your strap on your guitar as usual then put the locks on Rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap Once the lock has passed the head of the guitars strap button rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up close position which should be about 180 degrees from open position Very simple and works very wellI have not used any lock system thats perfect Every one that Ive used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly These work exceptionally well What I like about this design is that it doesnt require any modifications on the guitar or the strap You can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you dont have to replace the guitars existing strap buttonsBut they do stick out a bit to keep the strap from sliding off so if youre concerned about looks you might want to try another system thats more discreet Also I tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends These will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons Simple works well no modifications needed,positive
Fender quality is just a step above the competition and worth the extra money over cheaper generic products Worked perfectly for my latest guitar project Great Product,positive
This arrived and when I tried to use it it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapterInstead these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clipThis is such a standard item that there is no excuse for making it with nonstandard threads and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 58ths This is NOT universal fit,negative
I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape I guess this kit works okay but its hard to use It will probably last my entire lifetime I think a smaller kit would have been better You really need to remove the strings when you use it so you have to take off all the strings I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings so I had to change my habits If you have a guitar without a truss rod that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after youre done changing the strings since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned Im no expert but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent However since I love my guitar I use it anyway I guess this works but its kind of a pain to use,neutral
These were great I cant brag on them enough I AM however an electric gitty player primarily I just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting Great strings,positive
Ive had two of these tuners and they do a fine job as far as I can tell I lost one and had to buy another one I also bought a much more expensive tuner and I cannot see that it does a better job than this one I bought my first tuner like this one about 3 years ago and the rubber pads kept falling off but I have not had that problem with my new one Its been a good tuner for me,positive
I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together The glue didnt hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel This was unfixable so I sent it back for a refund Warehouse deals are not such good deals Might have been a good one,negative
wonderful price and great product Buy it Love mine and have recommended to every musician I know Works great and love the colorful display Great tuner,positive

Everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing packageing and shipping Well i bought all my picks from the music store so im rating the picks only Ive been playing a few years and own a takamine acoustic and a fender strat I mostly play my acoustic and use light strings so i dont need a heavy pick I started using med fender tortose shell celluloid picks and really liked the look but as a beginner i dropped them more My friend left a thin pick and i tried it Since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice The pick had a little more give so i dropped them less Ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it I started reading all these great reviews how the dunlop tortex was great so i ran down an bought some thins The tip is a little more rounded I tried them and they feel alright but the fenders were louder and brighter sounding no doubt about it So its back to the fenders Also something i learned is when i play a guitar that has a dark pickguard i use a light colored pick pearloid and a red pick for a white pickguard The contrast helps you see what your doing These are good picks and you have a good selection of colors instead of the dunlop that are color coded and your stuck with no choice These are a little more slippery but you will get used to them the more you play I dont drop em anymore Personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass The med is pretty stiff Good picks,positive
Why didnt I think of this Is what it is and does what it says its does From Martin nuff said neat idea,positive
Cool tuner I have this on my pedal board and it works really well very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isnt on poly tune,positive
I bought these lightpicks because of the price They work good if your strumming some light rhythms but they tend to be weak and break if your strumming a fast song I guess thats to be expected for a light pick Good picks good price,positive
i use this cable to run between my pedal board and amp at rehearsals in a small space i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the pa the box says they are 20 and maybe there is 20 of wire but the stretch on them is maybe 58 nice cable,positive
Have always liked Ernie ball productsso I thought I would like to try their stringsto see how they workI am very pleased Strings,positive
I hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good I havent had much chance to play it but so far so good It seems like it is good quality I am Vamped,positive
The unit I received did not work I returned it I like the other joyo pedals I ordered so I am going to give this one another shot Retrun did not work,negative
Ive kinda forgot I even bought this its just another cable in the mess of cables I already have But it works fine never had any problems with it I think its going through a cheap microphone I have so It shouldnt be put through any conditioning I think it would do fine in a live setting as well Its Just a cable,positive
If your going to use on amp get some two sided Velcro and stick on amp or two sided tape etc For price its fine Amazon is the best For price its ok but too light,neutral
This processor is okay for home practice if you need something other than just a dry signal The sound is a little too electronic for me I bought an RP1 and it sounds much better okay,neutral
Daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money Exactly as described and very affortable Would recommend this to anybody Handy stand,positive
This obviously is trying to copy the Kyser brand capo and it does it pretty well Feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise The cardboard insert in the package even has the 34lifetime guarantee34 but no info on where to mail it and thats pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect but other than that its a good cheap capo Ridiculous but useful capo,positive
The Boss ME70 is not as nice as the BOSS GT10 and will not let you install BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg I recommend getting a BOSS GT10 and then install BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg Now your guitar can sound like Eddie Van Halen Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg Search Google for BOSS GT10 Patches by James Limborg Not As Good As BOSS GT10,negative
First off this is a overdrive pedal with a MOSFET circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion The pedal is very good at this There are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp this is on par with the warm tone of another EHX pedal the Big Muff Fuzz The tone function is kindof useless to me I like to keep it on With the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh Dont let that keep you from checking this hot rod out I love mine Its a keeper Excellent reproduction of a classic pedal,positive
If you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new Martin guitar this is a must have product I didnt want to have a hole drilled in a new Martin guitar so this worked fine wit the Martin leather straps Actually I bought two of them It is a 5star product Martin Head Stock Strap,positive
This new type and design of capos manufactued in England and warranteed for life is truly wonderful Available in six and twelve string steelstring as well as a new classical version they are all easy to use solidly built and perhaps most importantly easy to put on and take off with one hand without having to retune For a musician this is the most cricial element that and that it is kind to the materials used in the manufacture of a good guitar I use mine on a Martin HD28 and have had no problems whatsoever A great move toward a new generation of capos Not cheap but worth every cent You Get What You Pay For Sometimes,positive
I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif simple and easy set up just plugged it in and it worked fine no complaints Its great to have sustain again on my keyboard again Well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif that was my main concern when ordering No other review stated that so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering I hate returning thingsLOL SUSTAIN GALORE,positive
I have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear bright yet robust sound and I found that in the Martin MSP 4050 SP strings I knew I had found 34my strings34 after a short time playing with these They are light on the fingers sound great and priced right Martin Acoustics,positive
I am primarily an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago a Gibson Les Paul What I am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars Most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others A few are actually a notchabove the others These NYXLs from DAddario are definitely in that notch above categoryI find them easier to play better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others I have tried I plan to stick with them A few comments about each areaPlayabilityThese NYXLs bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting left hand than do most of the others Of course I have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore These strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing THey also squeak less when I slide up and down the neckSoundThe sound is crisp and rich at the same time Most electric guitarists who I know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly I prefer a blend of both just as I do for my acoustic instruments These NYXLs provide the closest blend that I have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics andTuningTuning and retuning can drive a guitar player to distraction Even some really good sounding strings dont hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone These NYXLs are holding the tuning FAR better than the others I have used Less time tuning more good time playingAllinall I found no flaw in these strings There is always something new coming along and DAddarios formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference UNtil someone comes up with something better I expect to stick with them The Best I Have Ever Used These really ARE different and better,positive
This neck plate rides on the body of a Mexicomade Jazz Bass which I acquired secondhand replacing the blank factory plate It could be thicker it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up Still the guitar now sports the old Sixties Fender 34F34 logo F logo neckplate,positive
Ive been recording on my iMac iPod Touch iPad and iPhone for some time using Garage Band Interfacing with the iMac is easy using various USB devices Im currently using a USBequipped Alesis preamp iOS device interface is a bit more difficult it is possible to use USB preamps with an externally powered USB hub but that starts getting very complicated and messy Ive been using simple devices like the 1K that split the headphonemicrophone jack into two separate cords one for headphone and one for guitar The problem with this sort of configuration is that its very easy to overload the microphone input and the recording quality done this way is not very good The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons First it contains its own dedicated preamp and AD and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity Interface issues are nonexistent plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized I didnt have any problems with either of the three supplied cablesThe JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces but on the whole I think its worth it Its simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality It does seem to draw a fair amount of current and battery life is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone Youll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions With the iPad this isnt as noticeable Even with that issue I think the JAM is a good value The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings but only with quality input Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison Excellent sound low latency plug and play,positive
I chose this rating because even though it is an Epiphone a Les Paul and affiliation with Gibson it is made in China NOT the USA as one would think by the name affiliations I think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is NOT a USA product When opened the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but I did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case The white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory So someone messed up in QUALITY CONTROL With that said I find the finished look is fine without the guard the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified I decided NOT to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it Epiphone Les Paul AcousticElectric Ukulele,positive
This Mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our Studios here at Tune in and check it out I think you will agree Sounds great and at the Right Price MXL in Z108net Studios,positive
Love it makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy Quiet power supply lots of cables and end caps and adapters for what youd pay for a single power adapter Its nice not having to dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play About the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters but Im sure you can find them somewheregood quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply save your outlets just one plug,positive
Cant complain about a price like this Does the job just fine for what it is not really anything more you could ask for Comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most if not all microphones folds up nice and small Happy all around Does the job,positive
Tried these on Les Paul style with Jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about 25 different pedals metal overdrive echo reverb fuzz etc So keep in mind that they havent broken in yet as I do this review But I do feel confident in what I report hereThey are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels On the high gain metal muff fullbore guytone metal monster swollen pickle and big muff they sound really nice a lot of harmonics and output captured For that 5 stars easy I dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold Others may feel differently I am sure Then again Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output So you are getting what they sayHowever for a warm bluesy tone I couldnt get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels For that 15 star Average to 3 I guess Forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment For shredding go cobalt for warmwoman tone go PURE nickels thats PURE folks I also really like the daddario puresAlso these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel Hope this helps Good for high gain or metal style for sure not very warm in tone for classic rock or blues,neutral
I bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp It work very well There are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds Nice addition for the price Uses a 9V battery or power supply Sounds great,positive
Yes this pedal is made of plastic Yes it is inexpensive But dont be fooled unless you really mash on the switch button like an idiot or over torque the battery cover screw too hard with a screw driver and strip out the plastic threads it is pretty tough and durable The chorus effect has plenty of adjustment tone and depth It may not be a Boss pedal but for 1599 you are getting a tremendous value and it sounds very good I was so impressed with these inexpensive pedals I now own 4 or 5 of them As a hobbyist guitar player who does not want to invest hundreds of dollars into multiple effects pedals I am into 4 or 5 of them PLUS associated cables and a power adapter for about the same amount than I could buy ONE Boss or other high quality pedal forI would also recommend buying the Danelectrode 9V power adapter if you use multiple pedals You can also buy a 5 gang power cable and daisy chain up to 4 or 5 pedals from the same power supply to make your own pedal board If you have multiple Danelectro pedals it is a clean way to tie them together I also bought some short 6 inch instrument cables and daisy chained the pedal inputsoutputs together so I can have mixed effects or have each one independentlyThese pedals have been used almost daily for a couple of months now and I have not had one issue with any to date A few other guitar player friends that have tried mine out are also very impressed by them Absolutely a 5 star value More than an exceptional value,positive
I wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features Though its not perfect its like having a room full of guitar effects and different ampsPROS 32 amp models 16 cabinet models effects thousands of available presets TONES GALORE good software for managing tones and creating new ones can be used in front of an amp in case you want to know how a modeled MesaBoogie would sound coming out of a real Vox lots of connectivity compact enough that I keep the unit the cable and the power supply in my case no tech problems at all builtin noise gate and tuner easytouse tap featureCONS Theres a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models manual is a pdf file hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit though you can rename and rearrange them with the software presets based on famous songs dont always sound right minor background hum uses 4 AAAs in a few hours and the manual says dont use rechargables though it doesnt say why for legal reasons the unit uses generic amp names check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps theyre based on with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy doesnt sound as nice as a good pedal and a Marshall half stack no kidding right And I still dont sound like Alvin LeeAs an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp this thing is cool You wont get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it Master some of the ampcab models and how to tweak them for gain reverb delay etc before you dive into the presets And once youve got the presets you like best use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easilyThe Line 6 Pocket Pod Pack includes a patch cord power supply USB cable CD cheap ear buds and MP3 player cable The Pack is 150 new so if youre going to buy the power supply then just get the Pack If you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so its like new again Amazingly versatile practice tool,positive
It is very easy to apply great results and very little effort Im surprised by the results Never got this shine in my guitar with any other product Great product,positive
this holds guitars very well it is quality I wish it was made in America I gave it to my church neat,positive
I have always used DAddario strings Since the early 70s when I first found out they were manufactured right here on Long Island Ive never been disappointed by the quality DAddario a Long Island company,positive
This is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looperNo complaints with this Works Great,positive
I did my research on this buy I looked at a lot of reviews as well as youtube reviews comparing other headphones and these seemed to be the clear favorites over other competitors such as Beats Pro in which youre spending at least 100 of the total 200 on just the name alone such a ripoff if you ask me These are very clear and fine tuned My only knock on these is that they could use a little more padding for the top of my head So clear,positive
This thing rocks Best quality than polytune 1 lighter and best switch Brighter screen Simply the best for fast tuning Simply THE BEST,positive
As background Ive recorded many jazz performances and listen normally to electrostatic speakers and have a pair of electrostatic headphones as well as dynamic modelsThese Audio Technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise That said they are more difficult to design well as the closed ear cups and back create acoustic interaction with the back of the drivers These headphones have a very open sound smooth midrange excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid and perhaps a bit emphasized bassThey are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store Finally the pricing of these fine headphones are not over inflated as are many high quality products Highly recommended Comfortable and excellent sound,positive
A welldesigned strap that looks and works really nice Id say its a little expensive They should cut the price down by at least 13 and it would be a 5 star rating A really cool strap but a little expensive,positive
Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig It was cheap at around 20 some change but like the other reviewers noted its noisy with hiss So I took the advice of another reviewer bought the Fish Chips model by Danaelectro and its terrificI plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board turned them both on turned on the amp put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max no discernible hiss nor hum Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeableThis pedal has a cool 1950s style appearance It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar amp sounds For a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the 30 price tag If youre in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal then youll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this oneThis product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars Five Stars Without Hiss or Hum,positive
Handy well made small easy to see Great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to Handy,positive
Erm it does what it say it would do The nice thing about the 34super34 is its size in turn and its ability to hold more water Dampit Guitar Humidifier Super,positive
Forget all the volume drop comments There isnt any and it does not color your tone one bit I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in I wanted something to dress up slow ballads and of course Born On The Bayou This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it EXCELLENT PEDAL,positive
I replaced my delay foot pedal with the Behringer VD400 Analog Delay For the money it is a more than a competent addition to my pedal board It is doing exactly what I expected and much more The big name delay I replaced in all honesty wasnt as good I have more room and control with this pedal Also I can buy six of these pedals for what I paid for the last one You do the math Replacing foot pedal,positive
Very very useful Like seriously unless you are very very good you can QUICKLY get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear Very nice,positive
These Dava picks are very nice They are about the equivalent of a medium weight pickThe rubber grip area is great The feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time The Dunlop picks with the bumps are nice but this just feels a lot better between my fingersThere are three little lines at the center of the pick the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex This is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there isnt much of an effect no matter where I place my fingers The effect is subtle at bestThe only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short the rubber can end up striking the stringOverall I like these picks a lot The colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand Nice Grip,positive
This guitar strap is very comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric Yamaha guitarVery durable and affordableMy only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it wouldColors are abit too flashy Solid comfortable and very affordable strap,positive
This pick is def not one Id use to solo with but its def a good pick for slower more acoustic oriented guitarwork Whenever I play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out Great in certain areas,positive
I simply love the cradle from Jim Dunlop although a little pricey First the material that the neck rests in is very soft Overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar wont fall off of that skimpy little 3 legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this Planet I did find it to be a little short to support my Ovation Acoustic Bass but a small length of 2 x 4 fixed that Second it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which I need to get into the back guts side of my Ovation BELIEVE THE RATING ITS GREAT,positive
they do the job great not a bad price for as many as you getgoing to buy some more for sure the do the job great,positive
The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V Now I can take it along and use it in Europe Asia and USAI saved 30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240VHappy Customer New AC adaptor support 110V and 240V,positive
great little cable now i power all my pedals with one power supply makes setting up for gigs much easier is what it is,positive
Man this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks DO NOT BUY it is a wast of money ug Junk,negative
I have two of these now and they may be my favorite Had another brand that stopped working and replaced with this The other one was not bad i lasted probably 10 years What else to say Its a sustain pedal and its a good price and free shipping in most cases works great,positive
I like the Planet Waves instrument cables The cable material is very bendable and easy to work with Great so far Good cable,positive
Works great right out of the box Easy to use and accurate A must have for any guitar player Turn it on clip it on and tune Great tuner,positive
i used to only be able to play my keyboard for up to an hour before feeling uncomfortable this chair has fixed that awesome bench,positive
Im mainly a guitarist but I do play bass from time to time on an old Fender American These strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound I love the tone you get out of these very bluesy and the punch isnt too rough its just right Im a huge fan of DAddario been using their strings for at least 4 years and they never disappoint Give these a try if youre looking for some new strings DAddario does it again great punch and bright tone,positive
I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases Bright display easy to use works well and cheap I have bought several of their models I particularly like the fact that when the battery is dying the display becomes darker but the unit still works correctly I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries Had a problem with the pivot joint breaking on one of the older models but it was replaced without a peep by the manufacturer Newer models seem a bit beefier I have 6 of these,positive
I purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100 accurate and very easy to use His guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner He connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp If you are a beginner or seasoned player I know you will like an appreciate the tuner A must to keep in your bag especially for beginners a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on Great Value Very Functional,positive
I will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp The quality is great price is right and delivered on time Good quality and fits perfectly,positive
This is a great little ukulele to have around the house I originally ordered a different one and got this one in error but Musicians Friend showed exceptional customer service and refunded me the entire amount of my purchase which included a change out set of strings and told me to keep it all too I was flooredBack to the ukuleleAt first I thought this was cheap enough to knock around and abuse but I found myself actually liking this one The action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too I used the DAddario J53 black nylon strings The tuning is a bit off but easily compensated Its a fun strum and well worth the 20 A great little uke to have around,positive
I own a Fender 65 Reverb Reissue and I had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very very difficult to find However I bought this JJ Electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until I had enough money to afford a higherend tube and this blew me away I was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar soundThis was well worth the small amount of money that I paid for it In fact I think I will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until its almost dead before I purchase another tube I was very surprised,positive
This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago Its still in my primary set up The sound it puts out is very balanced you can get a subtle overdrivelike sound out of it or a highgain hard rock80s metal sound out of it For those looking for insane crunch this isnt for you Anyone that wants a nice versatile pedal this IS the one you want Classic pedal and a must have for anyone who plays electric,positive
The mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing I switch between playing guitar and bass so I often change the gauge of the pick I am using This pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often The holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not slide around the arm It holds the picks firmly there is no chance they will fall out of the holder Very handy way to store picks,positive
One Spots come with an 8pedal multi plug If you only have 4 pedals or lets say you have 12 powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they arent plugged into pedals Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs Very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff Great price great purchase If you use One Spot you can never have too many of these,positive
I take workshop style guitar courses at a local VoTech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall Bad scene sounds like an old El Kabong cartoon and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to classIts not the sturdiest most secure or most stable design out there but given its extreme portability and the use Ill put it to its going to work great Great design extreme portability,positive
I purchased this PA after reading several reviews and was convinced that is was right for me I like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack I was using the ION system it just got to be to much to carry around I go around to different venues and sing I just started in April after taking vocals for a year I love it so much Ive purchased this and my own Shure mic B205D is a powerful speaker system I love the crisp sound and now I can hear myself sing when I turn up the music I needed something with EQ on it as well you really cant go wrong with this PAmonitor I would have rated a 5 except when I turn it up around 45 degrees it begins to hiss Im not sure if this is normal or not you see I purchased an open box speaker The outer box packaging was questionable but once opened the PA itself was in prime condition no visible damage and all the materials were packed well The sound is great Im testing it out at home for now still have some time if Im not comfortable with the hissing Hope this helps with your decision Great little PA,positive
I does the job that I wanted it for Just to keep picks in my guitar case Its okay but it could be better Pick Holder,neutral
UPDATED 3162014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming reviewThe 2i2 is a simple setup Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs connect a mic or apparently a lowheadroom instrument to it run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a standalone program and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the PlugIns section of Ableton but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless Ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely so as no audio is being produced from my monitorsI wasnt sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR an Ableton problem or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers so after the gazillionth crash I screamed Ballsdogit and purchased a license for Reaper After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months I began to realize that my monitors no longer lock up but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably patheticI had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors Now Im in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers Garbage focusrite Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plugins and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface I have yet to experience a crash but I also have yet to experience any recording timeSeriously I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2 and came across a response from Davidfocusrite actually saying that you should not use this setup to record electric guitar and that if you need to record electric guitar you should get something with more headroom like the 2i4 That is just unbelievable in my eyesIm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle Besides that Ill more than likely still have multiple problems with the driversThis device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 14 instrument ins There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATINGThe good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 when not crashing or locking up the monitors seems to handle all of them well I constantly check for driver updates and have the latest drivers for the 2i2 but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their productsSorry focusrite you dropped the ball here No Headroom for Electric Guitar,negative
kripes manthe one time I go and actually buy a honer and its a bummer this thing has 3 keys off tune I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk Maybe its a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I m really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4 all i can say is buy Meranas for tryin out buy suzuki or Swan from ebayoverseas if yer a poor guy like meand youll be better off Oh btw hottip for poor guys again you can get a Mississipi River Harp for only 5oo if you have a Burkes outlet near youtheyre up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho the Doctah has spoken Straight up TerrAsh,negative

Ive gotten a number of these Joyo and Artec pedals now most from Earth City SoundTX mostly on eBay these days though I recommend this seller on prompt delivery but dont happen to know much about them otherwiseI got this one on a whim just to have a second delay Ive had the DigiTech XSeries multidelay for many years The fun thing this Joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy UFO scifiish sounds All one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs Guitarists who are fans of Yo La Tengo and similar groups spacey stuff will dig this box Solid hardware side mount ac power Goofy graphics of an eagle though I imagine by now theyve updated its look Great Product,positive
I got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin SUCKED big time so we got this to use instead Works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it I know everybody knows this already but Ive never played with a bow before most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers Works good once you learn the secret of using it for the first time,positive
This is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the Shure SM58 but doesnt want to lay out 100 I bought it myself as a kind of experiment Im learning blues harp I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing For this reason the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand While my Astatic JT30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love I cant easily mount it on a stand and use it for vocalsThe spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand And the lowimpedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedancematching and no resulting noise or signal lossThe mike isnt perfect but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies Here are a couple of more casual notes1 The mike in the picture looked bluish to me What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish2 The product description seems to report a weight of 85 ounces I measured this mike at 103 ounces That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that Ive used3 The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16000 Hz Bluesmen prefer a cutoff at 10000 to give a midrange boost but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike4 The mike doesnt have an onoff switch perhaps its only real deficiency These switches really are very handy5 In actual use the mike dosnt seem very susceptible to pops and there is no hiss6 The mike comes with a pretty substantial hardshell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around or storing this at home then the oversized case should work wellI hope this helps A value mike for the Mississippi sax,positive
Great picks not just for Jazz though I play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles Takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel but once you do they are fantastic Smooth Jazz,positive
This tunners turned my normal cheap Squier into a perfect Squier My guitar now stays in tune better than my PRS and Epiphone The best,positive

For me this stand is very well built not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price They dont touch the floor There are safety straps that hold my 3 acoustic guitars Fender Ibanez and my anybodys guess antiquein place without any difficulty so I dont have to worry about knocking them off or over It takes up very little space the biggest plus Perfect,positive
I bought this because I wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short Im pleasantly surprised with this cable Its decent sound and decent build quality for a good price Nice guitar cable even better price,positive
I am a pro drummer and run pro sound support PA systems for outside venues as well from time to time It is essential that I have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds These 50 ft xlr cables are made well I hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths And as usual dealing with GLS and Orange County they came fast packed well and safe I am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service And though on this particular order I had no need to contact them they checked in with me to make sure everything went well Great folks to deal with Continued great products and service,positive
This is a great little tuner for guitar Love the fact i can tune all 6 strings at the same time Great Tuner,positive
As a musician for over four decades Ive owned a number of tuners as the technology progressed My primary instrument is electric bass This is the finest piece of equipment Ive ever purchased and used and it has helped me solve a mysterious tuning phenomenon all players apparently face without knowing it Ill explain But first some details about the tuner its construction is extremely solid and its heft gives it stability When you place it on a surface top of your amp floor your knee it stays there Secondly the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditionsno guessing And thirdly it is extremely sensitive and accurate which brings me to my explanation of the mysterious tuning phenomenon At issue is the inability of inexpensive tuners to properly identify frequenciestones when setting string intonation at the octave fret Ive been using 25 to 40 tuners Boss Korg etc over the past few years that would indicate a string is in tune both for open string and octave But when simultaneously plucking an F note on the A string and an F note high up on the G string my ear would percieve that they just werent in tunethe cycles werent matching So that meant my inexpensive tuner wasnt nearly discriminating enough Once I began using this strobe tuner it clearly showed me with proper accuracy graphically what my ear was trying to tell me After setting intonation according to the strobe tuner my bass now performs as it should through the range of notesfrets over the length of the neck I guess another way of explaining it would be to say that its like having a GPS that is accurate enough to get you to the right neighborhood versus one that can get you to the right house For the money I feel Ive done myself a good turn by purchasing this strobe tuner Im satisfied I still keep one of my inexpensive tuners in my guitar case as it has a built in microphone and can be used by an accoustic guitar player if Im jamming with somebody This strobe tuner is cable input onlyno mic runs on a 9v battery with connectors for a power supply sold separately My only complaint with this device is the battery connector Its the typical type that plugs in to the top of your 9v battery with two wires leading to the internals I hate them as a rule I would prefer solid contact points and a compartment where you would simply insert the battery just like inserting any other battery type AA AAA C etc For Those Wanting Precision and Quality,positive
these things muffle sound great they have good sound quality perfect for recording loud drums perfect for drowning out people good afordable buy,positive
I have played through this for over 15 years and I will tell you right now get a big amp Get 2 amps and split the signal even You want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal Otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of Frail and BedazzledOtherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference and it should I have been in a couple bands where I just plugged this into the amp and played my riffs The free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafterIf youre looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz this is the pedal you need I only wish it went up to 11 The bigger your amp the better this will sound,positive
Id been shopping for a music stand at local music stores all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are 45 plus tax This item including shipping cost me only about 23 here from Amazon and the seller Musicians Friend sent it promptly got it within 10 business days without any problems I had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions The bolts arent as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand but I dont care about that Its not hard to adjust and most of the time I have it at a certain height so no need to fiddle with it but during a group performance it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother If youre someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height its no big deal Other than that it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should for 12 price off retail Excellent Im completely satisfied with this Basic music stand works great 12 off cost at a retail music store,positive
This is a simple straight forward and worthy replacement mic clip for the standard Shure SM5758 type mic Well made reasonably priced as with most On Stage stuff Does the trick,positive
For the money you cant find a better deal I am currently overseas and didnt want to bring my good guitar along This is a great playing guitar for the money comes packaged extremely well and high quality all around for the price Best deal going for the price,positive
I dont know who designed the leg feature of this thing but they need to go back to engineering school When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position theyre quite difficult to pop open and once opened into place you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the standItd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar I just dont like the features of this stand at all Locking Legs Into Place Caused Their Finish To Become Scuffed Up,negative
This bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount I am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an Ernie Ball strap The raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest Just the thing for my acoustic,positive

This is an amazing pedal delay flanger phaser tremolo pitch shifter All sound really good and completely adjustable Only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time For the price this is a steal Behringer Rocks Great things in one package,positive
A good quality cable to use while playing sitting to go down to my processor on the floor in front of me The angle goes up tight to the floor unit and out of the way and 5 feet is plenty Great cable I use Fenders 15 foot angle plug from the processor to my amp because stepping on the plugs can break the jacks Just What I Needed,positive
I have tried many types of steel strings My Taylor 355 came delivered with these and though I have tried several others I have returned to them Their ease of play smoothness to fret and finger and light but rich tonality makes them a good choice for your 12string Havent tried em yet Pick up a set they ARE different and in many ways better than the more standard Phosphor Bronze strings that were the best before these came along The best sound on my Taylor 355,positive
My revised review after about a year of useThe one thing I hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out so if youre not careful your guitar will fall It is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap once every few daysMy original reviewVery easy to install didnt require drilling I have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes Although it looks a little bit big and clunky its a small price to pay for stability I probably will get another set but may get the black ones instead of the silver because I think the black color may hide the clunkyness a little better Overall a very good product Hefty well built,neutral
I have been using this brand in several different gauges for many years and continueto do so I get long life and very good clarity from DAddarios DAddario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings 010046 Regular,positive
I love these picks They last a long long time and are surprisingly easy to grip Currently my go to picks durable and easy to grip,positive
I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980s Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didnt fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed I didnt return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board Save your money I went back to my Planet Waves CableI payed 3000 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around 5000 What Im getting at is you get what you pay for I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the daybut I havent bought a guitar cable since this one20 plus years and still workingPlanet Waves wins Didnt fit my 1996 Fender Strat,neutral
First keys are not my best instrument to play just a beginner Im a professional guitarist That said I purchased this for my home recording studio The controller that I had was a ION but had mini keys I love the fact that this controller has full size keys Works great with my Mac Book Pro and Logic Pro X I know its not the best controller but its good if your on a limited budget Nice Controller for the Price,positive
Acoustic guitar amps have more in common with stereo systems than traditional electric guitar amps neutral fullrange sound rather than crunch distortion high power ratings for clean tone full range speaker system with woofer and tweeter and sensitive preamp inputs optimized for the low output of piezo pickups Unfortunately for me acoustic amps tend to be optimized for steelstrings and rarely get classical guitar tone right even with dial diddling As a dedicated nylonstring player Im always looking for the holy grail of amps Is the Mini sent from heavenPIEZO TONE I jacked in my Takamine LTD2012 Classical and Hirade TH8SS classicals with Cool Tubes preamps and with tone controls set flat and had my ears pinned back with shockingly powerful output The master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular Unfortunately that big sound wasnt natural and sounded closer to an electric guitar than a classical big bass bright lower trebles weak mids quacky tone and compressed Obviously undersaddle piezo pickups are no studio mic but it should sound better than this So I diddled the controls and it improved a bit but I couldnt dial in a pleasing tone The best timbre with my Hirades was bass1100 mid300 and treble900 clock face orientationSome acoustic guitar amps allow the tweeter to be disabled and I suspect the Minis overly bright tone would benefit from cutting that little guy from the circuit As a point of comparison Cool Tube piezo pickup tone from my 21 year old Trace Elliot TA50R is much more natural complex and sustained Cool Tube piezo tone from my SHENCPK8T is dropdead gorgeous Perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and depiezo the tone They cost more than the Mini so they gotta earn their keep somehowI plugged in my mid1990s Trace Acoustic TAP1 preamp into the Mini and was able to dial in better tone albeit still not as good as my ancient TA50R I also tested my Fishman Aura Spectrum DI and it rendered more natural classical tone So you can get decent classical guitar tone if youre willing to carry another box to your gigREVERB The single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter and harsher sounding even when mixed in sparingly Wish this amp had an effects loop as any budget half rack unit will sound betterMIC TONE I dont normally use a mic for casual gigs but this is feature is handy when you need to mic a friend or blend in a small internal mic for extra ambience The Mini lacks phantom power so I installed a battery in my Shure 849 condenser mic set tone controls flat and was greeted with surprisingly natural mic tone I also tried my ancient Shure SM57 dynamic mic with similar good results albeit that mic needed a little treble cut As a point of comparison the Mini whips my TA50R good in terms of mic output and toneAPPEARANCE BUILD The Loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures And it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my TA50R If you drag it to gigs youll find the exterior delicate the vinyl material and underlying wood are easily damaged by gentle pressure from straps and carts Its the most delicate amp Ive ownedFINAL BLURB My feelings about this amp are mixed For value and use as a wee PA its a 5 star deal For under saddle pickup classical guitar amplification it works but is far from natural compressed dynamics bright lower highs even at full treble cut and the dreaded piezo quack So 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI or similar acoustic guitar processor does significantly improve tone but thats another 2 or 3 bills Unfortunately straight out of the cardboard the Loudbox is not ready for for primetime nylon string reproduction I suspected the Mini was optimized for steelstring guitar tone so I borrowed a friends Takamine EF341S and I was right steelstring reproduction is significantly better than nylonstring All in all the Mini packs a lot of punch for 3 bills and just may be the best buck to tone ratio deal for a novice coffee house artist Good value but not ideal for Classical Guitar,positive
I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before These are easy to install and simple to use All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set As others have pointed out these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove Ive read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I dont even notice the difference They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected My Strat is now locked and loaded,positive
I got the 50 standard black on black case The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush Wow Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway Regarding the item itself I am bit lukewarm I have a 500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions And I got that Its lightweight plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head However the fit is a bit loose and I dont have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane this case is not the one you want to buy Good Item for the Price,positive
They will always sound the same as the very first day I love this strings currently on all my guitars Cant find them when I travel great buy,positive
This is as simple and as reliable as it gets YOu dont need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt Been using these for decades,positive
This little dude weighs next to almost nothing It gets loud enough as you need it in a bedroom LOUD dont expect to gig with it and dont expect Marshall Tube quality either It does however sound amazing Its clean bright and loud For metal its got great control of the distortion tone which sounds pretty good PERFECT PRACTICE AMP,positive
I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line and was happy with it The sound I get with it is very very cool After a while it just stopped working While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online You cant beat the price If it does stop working after after a few years of use you arent looking at paying 90 or more for a new pedal All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasnt worth taking up our time since I could replace for 15 So I ordered another one Definately get an adapter for this Yes its casing is plastic but quite sturdy Just dont jump on it like youre trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off Guitars and effects are the tools of a musicans trade not the hammer and nails of a builders Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedalswellId suggest buying them by the gross Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips Used alone or with other effects the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis Great pedal at a really good price,positive
I have moved on to the Carbon Fiber and 3mm Lexan Jazz III picks but these Ultex picks are also very nice They are a little less bright than the Carbon Fiber Picks which in some cases is actually preferrable In my opinion At least at the moment the Jazz III picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy Once you get used to the small size there is no going back The large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator Jazz Picks are great,positive
I think these are the same as the pricey monster cables and half the price I will buy Planet Waves from now on Great cables and great prices,positive
At one point I had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat but then I smartened up worked my calluses to the point where I could probably play 1362s tuned to E with no trouble and realized that these strings worked great for my strat because of the strong tone that these provide and ease of bending on the upper frets These strings also are good for Les Pauls where the scale length is shorter than the Fender guitars making bending like velvet Good for bands where you dont have a rhythm guitarist,positive
This is just what I have been wanting for a while now I have my Les Paul style guitar hanging right by my computer desk and that baby gets played a whole lot more than when it was in the case A floor stand worked fine until I knocked it over one day Now it stays on the wall and away from danger but never out of reach Me likee,positive
Very beatiful and good quality Nothing bad to say its a Fender strap with the hard rock leather look Highly recommended Best strap,positive
I was rather skeptical of this little box amp but it works great My acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments Not sure how long the 9V battery will last but the advantage of such a small box with such a sound is worth a couple of batteries I have been playing on and off for the past three hours and it is just fine Well worth the money spent And it is small enough to fit right into the pocket of my guitar bagone less thing to tote Looks really cool too Excellent little amp,positive
This is definitely a high quality cable However my experience with this model and the less expensiveMonster Standard 100 Instrument Cable 21 ft straight 14 plugs S100I21model has shown me that the only difference is one is prettier with its gold colored bling fittings Sonically I found them to be the same or to my ears anywayAs you can see by the tag above this review Amazon has verified that I purchased this cable as well as Amazon verifying my purchase of the less pricey model on my review on that product pageI initially purchased a pair of these cables for my keyboards because I had invested a significant sum into those instruments and wanted nothing but the best cables I purchased the standard cables for some low end instruments including an old Squier Jazz Bass and a new but very inexpensiveEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar Vintage Sunburst neither of which to my mind warranted top of the line cablesMuch to my surprise when I started testing each cable on each instrument all through the same amp to keep things equal I could not discern any sonic difference between both Monster cable models Same manufacturer but different models To be sure this more expensive model looked cooler but when it came to sound no discernible difference that I could detect anyway More perplexing is the molded stress relief ends on the less expensive model seem to make that one more reliableMy recommendation is test both this one and the standard model sidebyside before plunking down extra money for no added value beyond looks which I have to admit may be a selling point on stage for some folks no shame as long as you know what you are paying extra for and why Look before leaping,positive
I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound Instead I couldnt put it away I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazingI would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp The 9v battery holds up well which is surprising considering the drive you got off itSo spend the 2000 and get something that is a real deal I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one GREAT VALUE,positive
I put these on a dual humbucker USA Strat The neck was predrilled so the posts on the tuners and the diameter of the center post fit perfectly Job only took about 15 minutes Excellent build and looks great Excellent fit,positive
I just finished installing 12 of these and couldnt be any happier with the product It is a sturdily built product with EVERYTHING you need for installation I didnt think this was possible but I actually found a product MADE IN THE USA I will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection growsI did NOT have the mismatching color issue that others commented on all I did was contact the seller in my case Brook Mays Music and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all 12 are going on the same wall They were extrememly responsive even sending two emails concerning my request basically saying they would do their best but no promises Well Brook Mays came through for me I received very quickly I might add 12 of these that matched perfectly I will definitely go out of my way to use this seller againAnother great experience purchasing items through the Amazon site Outstanding Product See Uploaded Pic on Product Page,positive
They do the job and are made well I guess the high dollar cables are better but its hard to tell the difference Good quality at an economical price,positive
Large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch The included velcro works well for me I havent had any pedals fall off yet Cioks PSU fits underneath with a couple of modifications Im careful with my stuff so the soft case suits me fine I can sling it over my shoulder and carry guitaramp all at once Plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag If you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though Plenty of room on this one,positive
Title says it all Good quality for home or studio use but not sure how it would survive if it were to be taken on tour Still for the price you get a nice adjustable stand that can be manipulated to get basically any mic position youd want from overhead for drums to fret level for guitars above or below vocalists depending on the tone youre hunting etc Versatile and great to work with Good for home or studio use not sure if Id take it on the road,positive
Without going to extremes and spending twohundred bucks on an NOS tube from 1957 I recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hitJJs tubes are welltrusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliabilityBTW 12AXT and ECC83 are the same tubeI cant remember the last time I had a JJ tube go microphonic beyond controlI have played full time for over 27 years I use theseHope this helps Great price Standard Tube,positive

I love these strings because the sounds are so pure and not twangy and they are pretty easy to use Each string is labeled so you know which goes where Im a beginner and can change my own strings so Im proud of myself Good tones,positive
First off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to it holds your guitar One thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus I use it for my Mitchell Acoustic and it holds it perfectlyAbout the effects on finish After Googling it calling where I purchased my guitar and reading the little tag on the stand the foam on this and many other stands may affect 34Nitro Cellulous Laquer Finishes34 How do you know if you have this finish Basically the value of your guitar andor the age This finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions It is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars It is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at GC told me About Ruining Finishes,positive
I use the chair for guitar bass keyboardsukulele and even cooking breakfast Lightweight slightly awkward but provides good back supportAs a righthanded player I practice both classical and jazz style with the guitar on my left knee For the position I use in this chair it is necessary to use the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest I do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck I can report that I have been very comfortable for long practice sessionsAs for the four out of five star review the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for 85 But its a nice design and thank you to the designer I would recommend it to those who can afford itAs for durability we shall see I have had it for three months now and it is still fine I use it daily Nice Chair Overpirced,positive
The price is a great selling point just by itself I use it with my acoustic guitar and the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest that I bought off Amazon as well Its a good combo It leads me to playing for longer periods Its solidly constructed It folds and is definitely portable Great buy Great value,positive
good deal quite the steal if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal im sure it will be amazing and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal those are pretty crucial to a drumset aww yeah,positive
I decided I wanted to hang my guitars on my walls instead of having them take up space via floor stands Just find a stud and drill in the screws theyll hold just fine Im really bad when it comes to stuff like this so I had my brother help me Just make sure you know what youre doing because I thought I did when I really didnt at allThe wall hangers look really nice in person and they keep the guitars held in place very nicelysafely The only thing you should have to do extra after purchasing and installing these is creating a makeshift wallpad for behind where the guitar is hung if something happens that makes it hit the wall it wont damage the guitar or the wallThis is as legit as it gets if done right though Ive had my guitars hung via String Swing for months and Ive had no problems or concerns I am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands It saves room and makes the room look cooler Sure does its Job,positive
Came on time Works Very good Strong spring that good start If needed I would buy another For me and my son it works great Works good,positive
Flatwound Ribbon wound Its all the same no squeak slick jazzer mellow in tone Its a sound that many would like to acheive But why not round wounds Round wounds give a bit of grip round wounds also have more surface area and are louder Okay but I have a pickup want the mellower tone sans finger noise Its important for my playing to not have finger noiseI have the Les Paul for harder edged music but the archtop jazzbox pleads for a mellower tone hence the flatsI have a couple of friends who are really great Jazz guitar stylists they both use DAddario Chromes over nickel so I thought I would try them out Nice buttery smooth and I couldnt really recognized the difference over nickel flats except the price and the wear seemed a bit betterWear and tear is not really a factor for me as I change out strings every 3 to 6 weeks depending on how much Im playingNot ready to take the plunge It is a different feel if not try half rounds Theyre a hybrid of both less finger noise a bit more surface area hence output Output is not a problem if you are amplifiedCheck them out I use the medium gauge with a 13 high E the G is wound also Finger style or with a heavy Dunlap tortex pick the attack noise is also reduced with the flats I like them alot No Squeaking,positive
Ive had this cable for awhile and Im not too impressed with the quality The plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin I use it at home on a practice mic and it hasnt had much of a workout I dont think it would hold up long on stage at a venue Fair quality,positive
Good little stand to hold your guitars They function well and are inexpensive The only downsides are that they are a bit light best to place them near a wall just in case you bump them Also it seems that every one that I have ordered Here and MF have had the foam a bit crushed up simply could be the packaging from the manufacturer though Do not use these or any other foam for that matter on Nitro finishes Good product at a Great price Stand it up,positive
Planet Waves makes good stuff Take the load off your shoulder from that old Jazz bass and get a padded 3 inch wide strap Its long enough to allow my bass to rest at arms length I can adjust it to fit my acoustic guitar which I hold much higher and check out the little pickpocket I like these well enough that I have four of them Nice and wide,positive
They are comfortable to use The Planet Wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick and I like heavy picks so the heavy option fits my preference Ive got a gig tomorrow night so well see how they work then What can you say about a pick,positive
If you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it Built solid feels like it could withstand a good beating which is good since my teen is using it Not complaints just works and is reasonably priced Good pedal at a great price,positive
Planet Waves Signature guitar picks always the best always reliable An excellent useful product that I not only use myself but often give as gifts to other musicians Michael Haller Captain Souls Sound Circus Beatles Signature Guitar Picks,positive
The Mooer Pitch Box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signalThe pitch knob allows you to raise the note 1 2 3 5 7 9 12 and 24 semitones or lower the note by 1 2 3 5 7 9 12 and 24 semitonesI found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the Pitch Box made the harmonies more pronounced Making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable And in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organWhen I had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar The detune mode sounds like a chorus but I almost never use it Mooer Pitch Box organ like harmonies,positive
I agree with the others Ive been using Fast Fret for over 20 years and Finger Ease spray for over 40 but I believe Slick is a better product I give it just 4 stars though due to its design The wiping cloth that comes with Slick is meant to fit in a small plastic ziplock bag inside the cap but its difficult to get the cloth back inside the small bag and its bulky inside the cap making it a little difficult to close with the cloth inside the cap It would be easier to close if the cap side was deeper the way its designed now the cap and the applicator are equally sized when they neednt be Thats a small gripe though if I could give it 412 stars with half a star off for the design I would its great stuff Another vote for Fender Slick,positive
Showed up in two days and it works great looks solid nice construction quality cord w right angle for 7 yea D Great quality for a low price,positive
This is a great microphone Its light sensitive and looks professional I used this alongside my Xonar DG sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted 22dB I would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording Great Microphone,positive
Its kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already But I cant help it I like this guitar Quite simply this is a really nice guitar Is it 750 nice No But for less than 100 nice doesnt even describe itMy Jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing The outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problemSince Id read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things I did was check it out thoroughly Nope no flaws noticeable to me Kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice Oh but I did immediately remove the pick guard It just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without itOther reviews had complained about a toolow action But mine seems dead on Of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule But even so theres really no way anyone could characterize mine as too lowSome mentioned rusty strings Not on mine The strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very wellAnd of course the guitar sounds good Again maybe not 750 good but at least 250300 good And certainly better than I expected it to sound at that priceSo if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar youve found it Stop wasting time Just click the buy it button Its not like this guitar needs ANOTHER review but I cant help it,positive
Love this little tuner I have several reds and several blues and this one seem to be about the same except the displays seems to be more accurate accurate and affordable,positive
Its simple basic but I dont think it does that good of a job This is because it doesnt really humidify that much and doesnt extend very far into the guitar Its simple,negative
Musicians Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair is a good deal for musician Buy it if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to Musicians Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair,positive
These do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome or a mix from a soundboard perfectly They are certainly worth the price Perfect drumming headphones,positive
Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors These super light flexible nylon picks are great if youre trying to play quietly If you prefer a flexible softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick Soft flexible thin pick great for playing acoustic quietly,positive
Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago and I have used the standard model for some time It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrumentI used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitarLater I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top pressing on the sides to saturate it then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it Then unroll the cloth put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks Worked greatSo I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same They now ship without the clips Company says theyve had too many complaints about scratches though I didnt seem to have a problem wasnt about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition More importantly there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube it was empty So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund No problem getting the refund but Im moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finishIf you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above that still works great but theres really not enough room for that in the OM model so between that and the missing sponge will just try something else Did not work for me,negative
This stuff is great Leaves board clean and fast No residue no sticky and no oil film Price is right If you use any fingerboard treatment try this one Try It,positive
So far this power supply is great Pretty compact and light come with all the power cables you need and does the job at a far more reasonable price at the other power supplies I was considering No complaints here Does the job at a great price,positive
That guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost It is a great pleasure to jam on it around Sound is like its real big brother Very very familiarI suppose it is the best choise for your kid All hardware is Ok Just give some days to tuners to get used to an Exellent guitar,positive
singing and playing menas you dont get to bend down and pick up that pick you just dropped I loved this holder its small enough to fit in your pocket and when you go on stage just throw it on the mic stand loved it but i forgot it at a gig thats the down side of it being so small easy to lose but it is awesome awesome until i lost it,positive
These have always been my favorite strings and Ive just about tried them all Everything from elixirs fenders gibson dunlop and everything in between I always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another Whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky they are a set of 12s Overall great strings never had a break on me last long sound pretty good too Favorites,positive
I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound this might not be the cable for youHOWEVER for the price and purpose this a five star cable The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection but also feel sturdy and secure The gold plating ensures a solid connectionWhat I like most about this cable is that its guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement or so their packaging claims I have not had to replace mine Good cable good warrantee,positive
First of all I liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord The jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief It sounds ok for the price Good cord,positive
The VT999 Vintage Tube Monster has quite quickly become my goto overdrive pedal surpassing other OD pedals Ive used including the Digitech Bad Monkey the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer the Boss SD1 Super Overdrive and remarkably the Fulltone Fulldrive 2 MOSFETThe VT999 has several things going for it Tweakable EQ HighMidLow which allows you to run a full spectrum from muddy dirty low OD sounds even from a single coil to bright screaming lead tones with high mids or highs Noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to squeeze the tone for some interesting effects Wide range gain that gets dirty around 9 oclock and fullon distortion when crankedNow for full disclosure sake I did change out the tube to a JJ Tesla 12AX7 but most people who know tubes will tell you that really tubes are often hitormiss simply on account of them being analog heaterbased elements Thats part of the fun of tubebased OD I have played a VT999 that had a great sounding overdrive but mine didnt have that sound until I put in a new tube Try it out with the stock tube and go to a different tube if you dont like it At least try a new tube before giving upThere are two things that I dont like about the VT999 and I can tell you both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone This pedal got it 100 right with tone after a tube switch The 2 issues are The housing is huge and if you look inside it seems like a waste of space Theres a lot of open space with nothing there and while I can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat its a bit overboard Compared to the Fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss Especially given the large enclosure it would make perfect sense to move the 5 knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side Thatd take little effort and given the independent power of this pedal would be a piece of cake to achieve Heck I could probably do it myself but I dont want to ruin the good sound this producesBottom line I understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything This takes up at least the space of 2 pedals Is it worth it To me it is I run 2 OD pedals on my 2row board and I can honestly say in the last 10 gigs I have never gone to the other OD Its been the Vintage Tube Monster every time VT999 a Solid Score from Behringer,positive
So far still Made in America I have been using formula 65 guitar polish for over 40 years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal Ive polished many guitars multiple times This gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new It works great on acoustic and electric solid or hollow body acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking It even cleans Finger Ease lubricants off the neck and strings I havent needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both Great Product,positive
I know that pick choosing is a personal matter I choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me Cool,positive
I have been using these strings for the last 7 years The tone last longer than any other string and they dont break on me In those 7 years I havent broke a single string That being said I dont play heavy at all I will buy these strings until the day I die especially the acoustic version of these Love These On My Strat,positive
Spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier these cant support heavy stuff and will knock over SO easily They sure are portable though not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny As far as wire music stands go this one is great but wire music stands are the WORST,positive
Fender springs Youll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole Theres too much tension to do it with your fingers My American Special Strat came with 3 springs and now has the five I find it stays in tune like a 34instrument34 should now The real thing,positive
I dont really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it I LOVE it bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound but ingage it with my delays and phase 90s and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss very cool and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank A must for any pedal board,positive
I really dislike the switch on this thing It does not click That may not sound like much but I tend to rest my foot on a pedal when I turn it off This does not turn off when I do that This is unlike any pedal I have played I realize Behringer is trying to copy the MXR but the switch substitution makes me wish I picked up a used MXR Anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane I really like the other Behringer Boss type pedals though as the switch is what I like Wish the phase came in a different case Hard to switch,neutral
My kid is happy with this strap for his guitar He did have to widen the hole a bit in order to fit the strap over the peg on the bottom of his guitar but ever since he got it on hes been very pleased He especially likes the colors Good strap,positive
In my opinionThis is the best amp in this category I know people who have the Marshall and the Fender I plugged into my little HoneyTone and I had the best sounding micro amp hands down They were both amazed with the sound They said well mine was only 45 and mine was only 40 Too bad so sad for them I told them mine was 20 Since it doesnt say Marshall or Fender I only had to pay 12 for a better sounding amp If you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts and know what to expect from a micro this amp does not disappoint Cant go wrong with this one,positive
Ive been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010 Good news these Aquila strings are on most new ukuleles Bad news These Aquila strings are NOT standard on some others I was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than halfhour You can get a tutorial to do anything on YouTube They will stretch and detune for a few days but once tuned they sound and just perform great Good price great product Order extra to keep on hand Should be industry standard,positive
Ive used GLS products before and they are good quality for a fair price Their microphones do a great job for little cost Ive been impressed These cables didnt disappoint me either Dont judge their products on price alone Try them first You will be pleased and your bank account will thank you Quality Cables For The Money,positive
I bought my Spyder Jam back in 2009 when it was fairly new I was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp I still am Its just possibly one of the best training and gigging tools for a guitarist out there You can play along with a drum track with a drum AND rythmn track and you get hundreds of presets and about 100 to make your own the Spyder pedals make it perfect allowing you to turn on recording functions drum and other functions and also with the expression pedal you get Wah and Volume The seperate tonal controls are great on this amp and if you really dive deep into the menus pitch shifting and timing are also available And with 24 minutes of looping time thats just crazy for the priceI found it interesting that for a while the Spyder IV 75 watter kind of dissapeared off the market in 2011 and part of 2012 It has basically the same presets of the Jam without the looper or drum and rythmn tracks and was much less money Id say it started to cut into Spyder Jam sales I have noticed that the Spyder IV 75 watter is back now but the Jam keeps right on going with updates and endless support from Line 6Even the eight year run of the Fender Cyber Twin and Cyber Twin SE didnt offer the possibilities of the Spyder Jam and the Cyber Twin was well over 1000 new Yes it has a tube preamp and rewires itself to better simulate amps but the Jam is SO much more in line with the budgets of up and coming guitarists No contest moneywise And the CyberTwin is gone nowIf you want an amp that you will keep for a long long time take a real hard look at the Spyder Jam An enduring amp for good reasons,positive
Is kind of good i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit tending to sound better for more time and last longerYou just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so Im not sure if it was worth the purchase But is a good productRecommended Im not sure really,neutral
I replaced an older Snark that I use all the time but seems to be cutting out sometimes I love this new one Its a bit easier to see the display Great tuner,positive
The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles I just got one and have used it for a few days and its the bomb I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over This product is a rubber disc with small arms in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface and you can set your instrument against it and voila it doesnt fall over Here at home I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove heel on carpet neck in Guitar RestIm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases because I can use them at one of my uke parties If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor for instance to take a whizz theyre just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them Here I just find a spot near wherever Im sitting and it becomes my lean spot and I can even set my beer can on the round part on the back Coaster ukeguitar holder Its quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument I could carry a metal stand with me but it wouldnt fit in my ukulele casethis Planet Waves product does A winner Ukulele Stand,positive
This Orange Micro Crush amp lives up to its name Its little bitty about a third the size of the Roland Micro Cube but its plenty loud Surprisingly loud really its amazing that much sound comes out of that thing Of course it doesnt have all the bells and whistles of the Micro Cube its basically got a clean channel an overdrive channel and a tuner Then a volume knob a tone knob and thats it The over drive gives a good sound but I like to run pedals through it anyway Its missing reverb which I would like to have but its far from a deal breakerI have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock Of course its size and trademark Orange color make it look like a toy its definitely a capable little amp Definitely a keeper Little bitty but packs a punch,positive
This shelf is exactly what I needed at a reasonable price I used this on my wallmount 4U rack to hold my modem and router near my switch As an added bonus it has vent holes on the bottom which not only allow for heat dissipation but also make really convenient ziptie tiedown locations Ill definitely be buying more of these Awesomely Sturdy,positive
I purchased these cables for my Behringer 802 mixer MXL 770 mic and these cables are perfect Finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing I have the professional cables to back me up The best XLR cables you can find Hands down Amazing cables,positive
The lowE tuner on my 1985 LP Standard broke about a week ago the back came off and the tuning handle popped out I never liked the ones that were on it but I didnt want to drop the unless I needed to I came across these Grovers They had good reviews and the price was rightTook me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and restring the guitar The tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever They also feel more sturdy than the ones I just replaced Its hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as I havent had them on for long enough they seem better though as the B string with the old tuners used to always go flat quicklyI decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these Grovers they fit better ie tighter Nothing wrong with the new screws I just like my stuff to be snug I like them and glad I purchased them so far Dropin replacement for my 1985 Les Paul Standard,positive
Fender cords look great and work just as well By adding the word California to the description Im sure to sound like the Beach Boys Add California to the name and I jump,positive
If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar Volume Pedal Amp configuration inserting effects pedals anywhere you like this is a POORLY engineered pedal It cant be true bypass as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forwardAnyway the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable The tone becomes duller the output drops I would expect that from an Asian knockoff not from an Alist gear maker I might be overstating Ernie Balls reputation though they make some fine guitars I gotta say and Ive used their strings for many yearsIf you plan to use this EB6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker The signal processing takes place in the unit not the pedal Those units have their own tone problems but thats another reviewIt does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer NOT true bypass in other words may fix this problem which is more than likely related to impedance like a tuner pedal between the guitar and the volume pedal I will need to try that out but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility Major FAIL on their part2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple first do no harm principle It harms your tone How dumb is that The pedal itself is very attractive appears indestructible though I have my doubts about their string mechanism over time The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floorI have no recommendations for a volume pedal Because of the feel and esthetics I do plan to keep this for the digital device use but wish it was able to do what it promises and fails so miserably to deliver Tone and Volume sucker,negative
cant go wrong with Dunlop pick they last and dont break end up losing them verses breaking This 38 mm is a bit soft for my liking will go a size thicker next time good picks,positive
Light weight compact and all in one tool what more could I ask forThis tool does three things very well turns tuners on stringed instruments quickly cuts musical instrument strings and helps pull acoustic guitar string pins Whats not to like Well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open guess Im used to side cutters or pliers and it doesnt cut strings really close to the tuning pin it leaves about a half inch of string hanging Oh if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar go to the Elixir Strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the Taylor guitar factory your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners The alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton moreI find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings somebody could manage to break this plastic tool The tool is made of sturdy plastic If abused trying to cut copper wire it might break but the tool was never designed for that useIve used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time I use this on three different guitars an acoustic and two electrics Les Paul and PRS The pin puller works just fine I actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood The tool fits inside my hard shell Gibson guitar case This is a very nice tool Does Exactly What Is Described,positive
Nice quality and love the cutter The winder is a little awkward to use I guess I need a little practice But the cutters are great Winder is a little tricky and takes some practice,positive
Great guitar string at a reasonable price I highly recommend these acoustic strings they are also available in light or heavy guageif you prefer I like the EJ 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar Great Product,positive
I purchased this because even though I use mostly Boss effects I also use a Behringer Hellbabe Wah Some of the reviews mentioned that Boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a footprint for a wah type effect I must say thanks to those reviewers The only issue I have is that Im kinda slow so it took me a while to realize that I had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably I was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict but so far it has been a perfect experience This is such a sturdy board I must say though that I had no idea it would be so huge This is a perfect addition to any serious rig UPDATE 21610 Ive finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the Boss Phase Shifter So far this board has performed superbly Yes there is some noise as there always is when using overdrivedistortion pedals but no more than is to be expected I use a Boss Noise Suppressor Sorry if this is beginning to look like a Boss ad and it works perfectly Amazing deal,positive
This is a pop filter It does a fantastic job at that The plastic rings feel a little cheap but that is just because they need to be lightweight Ultimately this is a great pop filter and the gooseneck is very strong but flexible I would highly recommend this piece as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close Brass Tacks,positive
I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a halfway point where access to electricity is unavailable I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone It might work in a Busker situation This is great,positive
As expected from Hosa another great product Solid construction and great sound reproduced i would recomed this product to everyone Great Y cable,positive
Good idea Tends to slip on the strings however Convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck Slips on the strings,neutral
The rosin does the trick and its cased in a nice wooden holder so it shouldnt crack easily unlike those round rosin containers Violin Rosin,positive
Eh I wish I had more of a passion to play it butehh Its not bad if you want a uke but its pretty small I dont know what I was expecting I dont know shit about ukuleles but I do know get a bigger one if youre not comfortable with small frets If you wanna be that one fat Hawaiian guy Israel Kamakawiwoole go for it but I think he played a little bigger uke than this lmao Israel Kamakawiwoole would not approve,neutral
I bought this because after I rebuilt a guitar that was very special to me it wouldnt stay in tune I took it to a number of guys thinking I did something wrong in the build and was just overlooking it I use a capo a lot so when someone recommended thisI thought they were crazy Im not paying that much for a capo and I doubt that is the problem WellI broke down and Im glad I did This thing is amazing It solved the problem because I can set the tension and the design make it sit just right on my strat Spend the moneyits worth it Only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly The capo to have for electric,positive
I purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rigI am a bass player by trade though I dabble with many other instrument as many of us do I typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows when the sound system is adequate via SansAmp ParaDriver or VT Bass Deluxe DIAround my modest home studio I often need an XLR to run just a few feet from my DI to my interface so the AT cable works well there For being a thin flexible cable I notice no noise issues or interference problemsI also sing backups on stage and I typically run my mic into a TC Electronics Mic Mechanic pedal which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals and then to the mixer I use the AT 10 XLR to run from the Mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show then I run the standard XLR to mixer or stage snake out of the TCThe cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment unlike many of my other cheaper XLR cables This cable at least in its 10 form sounds just as good as my Mogami Silver 25 XLR I know that many cheaply priced XLRs are noisy and problematic I have several I dont have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my Mogami cablesOn short I would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike Clean clear audio on a budget,positive
I didnt give 5 stars just because I know there are better strings out there but these strings are a great value and wouldnt hesitate to buy them again In fact I have already bought them several times One little thing I appreciate about these strings is the different colored ends that makes them easy to identify Good strings,positive
Martin strings just wish I could afford a Martin guitar They last and they stay in tune Sound very good too What can I say,positive
I always use the 100mm for guitar had to test them with bass strings they turn out to be great Great for bass strings,positive

I dunno cause Im stingy with stars These have a nice sound I had an old guitar I bought for cheap at a garage sale for my son 8 at the time to play on but never really cared for it I finally got it out and started to tune it but the steel strings broke SO I replaced with these Its a classic guitar it shouldnt have had steel strings to begin with Why not 5,positive
Smart design excellent performance What more could you want The Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use with great pick up for desktop podcasts user testing screencasting and similarBeing a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic I had to look up what cardioid meant I found a solid explanation at a site called WiseGeek They explain cardioid Several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks Some such as condenser microphones pick up a great deal of sound from several directions while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction Of this latter group the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable It gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis This means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides My apologies to those pros out there who didnt need this clarificationHaving used the Samson Go Mic USB Compact Mic for a few months I was familiar with the Samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the Amazon Vine program I had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the Go Mic but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the timeIve been happy with theSamson Go Mic Compact USB Microphone Plug n Playfor use with my desktop and laptop PCs I do a lot of usability testing for various websites and its imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise pops hisses or similar I have to say that the Samson Meteor is a touch better offering clear crisp recording and reproduction It also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulousI like the retro styling of the Meteor and the builtin stand is great for desktops Less portable than the Samson Go Mic the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch The included USB cable is also of ample length for easy setup in a multitude of situationsThe mute button on the front of the Meteor is very handy Much easier than using software to get the job done and an amber light makes it easy to recognize its mutedThe build quality of the mic is excellent Very solid highend feel You can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the frontThe Samson Meteor didnt ship with any software which while unnecessary for installation my Windows 7 and 8 PCs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included USB but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with itAnother product Im reviewing theSamson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LEand the Samson Go Mic both ship with Cakewalk software The Samson Go Mic with Cakewalk Music Creator LE and the C01UCW ships with Cakewalks SONAR LE software so I found it kind of surprising the Meteor did not at this price point For me it works out as the others have the software and they work with the MeteorThe included booklet includes a Quick Start guide for PC and Mac Installation howto the Layout diagrams Specifications Polar Patten Frequency response and Recording Techniques for vocals acoustic guitar piano guitar amp and overhead drum kit The Samson Meteor Mic Warranty Card is also in the bookletOverall Im very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the Go Mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using Dragon voice recognition software I have purchased an adapter to use it with my iPad so I can play with Garage Band and know it will be great for future screencastsMy only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package which other Samson products as mentioned have packaged with them I give this product 4 out of 5 stars I Like It for this reason If Samson included software itd be a 5 star product for me Seemless setup and ideal for simple daily use,positive

Back in the 90s I used to have an Ampeg guitar head with an effects loop I discovered the rack version of the BBE in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120 but sadly it has no effects loop So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and lo and behold there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version One caveat if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it This pedal is very subtle but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system Its also great for vocals as well But you may want the rack version for those applications I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through IMO the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does Id go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBEs for not much more money that you can use for another application Just like the rack mount,positive
I mean you paid 15 for a pedal that if you want to buy from the BOSS its about 6times this price and if you want it behringer its about twice this price It does what is supposed to and it doesnt have a cheap look For home and garage entertainment is good enough I was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand but now that i know that i like it im going to buy the distortion red one im only sad they dont make a noise gate or something similar That would be the top of the deal Its allright,positive

There are a fair number of similar tripod guitar stands out there for about the same cost If one of your pet peeves with some of these is that the Ushaped support falls out when you carry the assembled stand around then youll especially like the World Tour stand The way that the Ushaped piece inserts makes it far less susceptible to falling out And although it is as one other reviewer put it minimalistic this stand has a substantial feel to it Im quite happy with this purchase and would buy another World Tour again rather than one of the other brands that I own Amazoncom did a great job too getting this out to me Good Quality Great Value,positive

As a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks I was displeased with most of the standard picks partially because I didnt like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didnt sound quite as robust as I like hopefully that makes sense However when I was handed one of these it produced a pleasant sound and I didnt feel like I would somehow break the pick while playingNeedless to say now that I have my own guitar I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed Never Using Another Pick,positive
This pedal has been around for a long time and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals the boss ds1 remains the staple image of distortion stompboxs The ds1 is a nofrills tank of a pedal it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give itThis pedal doesnt replicate any type of amplifierits not a Marshallinabox or a mesa boogie or a vox or a Fender from a tonal aspect it isnt complex or dynamic It will add plenty of grind to your tone and plenty of hum to go with it If youre looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15watt practice amp look no further If you have a decent tube amp look elsewhere because with this pedal you get what you pay for and it simply will not do a quality amp justicePros Inexpensive good build quality distorts your signalCons Lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fastWithout the excessive hum and almostunusable tone control this would get 4 stars The most basic of basic distortion pedals,neutral
I received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard I was assembling my plan was to try something different to compare against the Boss NS2 Noise Suppressor on my other board While I love the build quality and simplicity of the oneknob setup I cant say yet that I like it better than my NS2 With the caveat that I may not have it wired up 100 correctly I felt that it did kill most of the excess noise but not all of it Good product but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price Will update this post after I play around with different arrangements and get more experience with it Works well seems like it could work better,positive
The Boss CS3 is right for me I have been using it with excellent results I have many compressors Line6 MXR Behringer Digitech and although I alternate their use the Boss stands out on many rig configurations it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product I highly recommended it as your main compressor if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it good luck Boss CS3 Compressor,positive

This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveatsFirst its construction is pretty light weight That means you will have to be gentle with it when using it Thats something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat upSecond the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapterSo just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable heavy duty and with a longer cable for the same price It pays to shop around Light Weight Cable For Stereo Mics With Limitations,positive

I have always hated tuners I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external powerpedals In addition I couldnt use those on my acoustics Snark solves all of these problems The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo I can easily move it from electric to acoutic and Amazons pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars This is one of the few 5 star ratings Ive given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot Death to tuners Long live Snark,positive

I got this for one of my guitar students whose mom just wanted a cheap case for her acoustic guitar Now lets be clear this is easily worth 16 but it is a very barebones gig bag It will protect your instrument to a degree it only has minimal padding and is probably good enough for any beginner instrument ONe of my students has one of those Esteban infomercial guitars which is pretty low quality but not terrible and not unplayable and the gig bag for that instrument has no padding whatsoeverI only give 3 stars because for a little more money its possible to get something which I feel is noticably better I have a Musicians Friend acoustic gig bag that I paid 20 for a few years ago and its well made and probably has twice the padding of this thingSo this isnt bad its worth the price its put together just fine but it only just barely serves its purpose of protecting your instrument and Id never trust this with an instrument of any value Gig bags can be a good alternative to a hard case if space or weight are a concern This isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what youre getting Not bad worth the price,neutral

Its a good amp im happy with it The high gain is not the best a lot of unwated noise even while playing and i see a few people on here have had the same problem But i mostly play punkhardcore and blues which is does very well So when im in a metal mood i use a BOSS metal zone pedal on a clean BUTCHER seting and no unwated noise even at loud volumes so its good amp i just wish i didnt need to use pedals to get good metal sound thats why i got this amp so could get rid of my pedals o well Good bed room amp,positive

For the price fantasticThey do feel light and I dont trust the build quality at the key stress points where cable meets connector but then again I am not going to push itSet your guitar down on it by accident when its plugged in andwho knowsBut for seven bucks it gets the job done Recommended if you are doing the beginner thing and testing the watersOtherwise spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting Feel a little flimsy and can see easily breaking but the work,positive

Just got my stand today the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced Go go Amazon lulz Anyhoo I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for I looked about for quite a bit at various sites reviews prices etc and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere although admittedly I hadnt really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars Yet this tristand really looked good with a solid general review and I am rather tight for space overall think trailer home size I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gigbags or hard cases taking up limited living space As it stands figuratively and literally the Hercules TriStand does the job excellently with the two banjos All three instruments are varying heights the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest and naturally the mandolin being the shortest with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middleThe three backrest fold outs are static attached to a center ring and you can adjust them independently a little up and down but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin However the mandolin is a really lite thing so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a backrest as long as the stand isnt jostled around In my own case aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hipsmashoops by me that shouldnt be an issue And of course considering I am looking at a possible third banjo the mandolin may just go live in its case after allNow a word about open back banjos if you are considering this stand First off no I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the backrest just seems like a bad idea What I ended up doing was adjusting the backrests so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest along the lip of the banjo rim at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down The tailpiece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the topI give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application would need the three backrests to be independently adjustable in height for that but overall I am extremely pleased with it 2 Banjos and a Mandolin,positive
I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off super bright sounding on first installation played for a half hour and retuned sounded better Played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic Will update after I get a hundred hours on them about 50 days from now Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasnt hurt them yet VERY IMPRESSED The more you play the better they sound,positive

I was considering a 100 KK pickup to amplify a 40 pawn shop guitar I have grown fond of I bought it to take to the beach and camping places where I would be too nervouse to bring my expensive guitar I couldnt justify spending over double for a pickup than I did for the guitar so I bought this and am glad I did Arrived in one day and I first experimented with different placements using the double sided adhesive that came with it on the outside of the guitar plugged my cord into it uninstalled and played around for 20 minutes youll notice a huge difference in sound from inch to inch Found a sweet spot near area 34234 on the weak instructions I drilled my hole using a straigh bit because my end pin was screwed into a mahoghany block almost 134 thick I didnt want a tapered hole from a reamer I wated a straight hole As others have noted it was impossible to fit my arm through the soundhole so I inserted a philips screwdriver through the end pin hole and slid the jack onto the tip of the screwdriver to help guide it out through the hole after first slipping on the plain washer and then the friction washer with the little teeth to dig into the wood and hold Because you cant reach in there and hold the jack steady while tightening the outer nuts they give you holes through the threaded jack very easy to go unnoticed I was able to spin the washer and nut on the threaded end and secure them by holding the threaded portion from spinning with an ice pick or awlinsde the jack through one of the small holes while I tightened the nut firmly Took 3 trys before I had it adjusted to the perfect length so that when I spun the nice little finishing cap on over the threads it tightened down just right with the threaded portion flush with the cap for a neat appearance Too much and it sticks out too little and theres not enough thread to tighten this cap on you adjust the length of the installed jack with the nut on the inside of the guitar theres plenty of threaded jack there to accomodate any thickness of the block of wood at the tail of the guitar where the 2 sides meet Plugged into my fender acoustasonic 30 and Wow was blown away by the sweet sound I am so glad I saved a ton of money Ordered 2 more for my other guitars Even one for my nylon stringed acoustic since the pickup is not magnetic I will say this the output is very low nessesitating that I turn up my amp to almost 10 to fill my livingroom this would not work for playing out without a preamp but I like that theres no battery and I plan to buy a strap mounted external preamp that I can economize and use one preamp for my 4 guitars rather then installing 4 preamp equipped pickups in all my guitars at 100 each Terrific bargain for the price LOVE IT Read below for helpfull INSTALLATION TIPS,positive

For about 30 yrs have been playing finger style only usually with alternating bass and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choiceFor the song I was performing chords were Bm E Fm and G 1st 3rd position and I needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an introI found a very old and very thin Peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue Dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so I then ordered the Fender Abalone Thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easyFender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks 12 Pack Abalone ThinMy ancient Peavey broke in half not long after and I continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new Fender picks to arrive because I liked the extra flexSeems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings but since I never liked using a pick at all the Fender Thin works best for me and Im enjoying learning to use it on songs like Eric Claptons interpretation of Bessie Smiths Nobody Knows YouIll try the Dava picks again later if I feel the need I play Simon and Garfunkels version of Scarborough Fair which is exclusively finger picking and George Harrisons Here Comes the Sun where he uses a pick but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyleThis is all on an acoustic 6 string steel guitar using DAddario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze light stringsBristol by Blueridge BD16 Dreadnaught Acoustic Guitar NaturalDAddario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings LightFor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before the Fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so its not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the stringsThe grip is better on the Dava but they arent going to flex as much Undoubtedly better for more accomplished players Most advice Ive seen says try em all and decide for yourself I was just amazed and delighted how much easier the Fender thin made it for me to get started Grip is nice but a thinner pick worked better for me,neutral

I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedalsI dont use this on my pedal board and dont know if I would recommend it for heavy live use I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key hereIt does work well and will power many pedals at one time I do not use it for powering only one pedal though This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedalsI also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outletEasy to use it is what it is Good for the money,positive
Blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store fit very well my mic Awesome Great for an amateur just like me Nice price,positive
More knobs are not always better In the case of this pedal the controls are really sensitive theres a pretty big mid hump thats hard to dial out and the low end control can make things really boomy or add a little chunk to the sound You can do a lot with it but I struggle to find what it does best because it doesnt really do edge of distortion well it doesnt clean up and its not a really high gain distortion pedal but it can just add a bit of tightness hair metal mids or thump to a standard OD sound Basically if you have your amp set for 70s rock you can stomp on this and get Motley Crue or maybe Bark at the Moon era OzzyLike a tubescreamer this thing lets a little bit of the clean signal through so you hear the distorted guitar mixed with clean signal The circuit design is nothing like a tube screamer but it can work as a substitute I think if you wanted the tube screamer sound theJoyo JF01 Vintage Overdrive Pedalwould be better just for simplicity sake and being more of a cloneSo its not bad but its just not on the level of boutique pedals and their clones If you get tired of it give it to your bass player or try it with a bass for an interesting tone Useful but hard to dial in,neutral

This polish works well for what I need it for I am not a clean freak but I take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there Does the trick,positive
for the price of this windercutter its awesome if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect great,positive
Works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar Compact enough that its able to be stored in your case if you want or if you have a tech box that you bring with you Compact when put away stable when being used,positive
They say 24 months Ive never come close to even a month Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks If it sounds too good to be true it usually is I dont recommend these Total bust,negative
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks love Planet Waves gear AWesome for winding around crowded pedalboards,positive
This is one awesome guitar I also purchased the Fender Mustang I Amp Epiphone custom case fits like a glove and Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap comfortable and very secure which made for an UNBELIEVEABLE combination along with Rocksmith 2014 I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination The only problem in my household iswho gets to play next Sweet Through and Through,positive
I admit it my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick Hold my tab securely so I can flip though it with ease while Im still playing my guitar Much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage Great for memory farts,positive
Plugged it in and it powered my Rode NT2 condenser mic I was delighted I was delighted,positive
I was not expecting the Onstage Tripod boom microphone stand to be this good The bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced The main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust It is built like a baton The arm is adjustable and long I usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm It can hold quite a bit of weight I havent tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and myMXL 2010 Multipattern Studio Micwith ease The adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees Smooth movement When I need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motionI love this microphone stand It stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall Very high quality microphone stand Buy with confidence Just wow Amazing quality and versatilty,positive
This was much smaller than I thought it would be but I kinda like that because it takes up no space It does exactly what is expected of it The effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work although certainly would not replace the likes of TC Electronics or Lexicon Relatively transparent and controls are responsive For the moneygood value Good little mixer,positive
this little stand is great I am looking at it right now across the room holding my Zager guitar it is light non obtrusive holds the guitar well and it is portable when Mr Guitar and I take a trip together I highly recommend it keeps that guitar off the bed floor table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be great little stand,positive
this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar He has enjoy and likes using the capo Nice item,positive
The tuner is perfect for me It fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case Just perfect for making those play dates at the Resonance Fair Always spot on with the frequency Nice product Beginner,positive
This works in some applications but doesnt work in many others Even when detected by the software it will not work with Line 6 equipment Too bad because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop Hit and miss,negative
Good strong spring and good strong materials The only improvement I would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck The protector needs to be longer As the protector ages it slips off the end If it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help Kyser capo,positive
I brought for someone else But they said they love it So I am a happy camper I did it right nice,positive
Bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings His guitar always sounds awesome and I always ask his advice for musical products I even sound OK when I play his guitar so I say try em out woozie swears by em,positive
I have one one these from the 80s back home and when I was looking for a new peddle I found this was still the best around I remember searching for the right peddle back in the 80s and going through dozens of them before settling on the Rat And its exactly the same Simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain I run it through all manner of amps including Marshalls Vox and even Crate both tube and transistor and with a few quick easy adjustments I get exactly what Im looking for no matter the boxIm an old school player meaning I want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors This is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it though I expect anyone will get what they want from this baby Best distortion peddle still And a steal at this price,positive
In my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around From experience they tend to just die without notice I have a feeling this one will last a long time It is built sturdy and sounds really goodI recommend this product works as advertised,positive
The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on which produces a sound The Morley pedals have a separate onoff switch so you can turn them on or off at a given position The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isnt always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle and just leave it there You cant really do that with this pedal It is a bit smaller than a morley wah but in my experience the sound is equivalent on the base models Step to turn onoff,neutral
great stuff to have for a great price8230i like it highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar like it,positive
Not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic Pivots in 1 direction only Not the best build quality in the world actually fairly thin plastic but for 5 what else can you ask for Should last a few months at least Good basic mic clip,positive
works with myOn Stage KS7191 Classic DoubleX Keyboard Standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by On Stage as wellOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom Blackworks as advertised You just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tubealso comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it Nice attachement for my Mic Boom,positive
I have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings plugged straight into my bass amp for home recordingpractice Having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere It works fine It is lightweight and feels sturdyOnly drawback I tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass and the preamps saturated in low frequencies Input has to be kept within a small range Very convenient,positive
I am a believer that if you have a musical instrument it has to be out if you are going to use it regularly with these sturdy stands my guitars are out and around the house and they seem to 34talk to me34 every time that I walk by this encourages if not compulses me to pick them up and play them for 515 minutes at a time these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well I would not recommend them for heavy on the road stage work but then again most of us are not on the road nor the tour we are just playing for the love of it I have 4 of these and they work great for my guitars,positive
Ive been playing for about 17 years Most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in Columbus Ga My performance guitar is a Martin HD28 and my practice guitar is a Blueridge BR180I wanted a third guitar just for kicks Id been looking a Taylors but didnt want to spend that much moneyEnter the Seagull S6 A fellow picker asked if Id ever heard of a Seagull I hadnt he said they were nice guitars and I ought to check them out So I did a little research I first read all the nice reviews here for the S6 and then went on YouTube and listened to a few My guitar is a Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 and I really like it I choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft and I understand that the spruce has more volume I got the S6 today and this evening my wife with her Taylor GS Mini and I with this S6 played Smokey Mountain Memories Nice real nice guitarI found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box Im going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pinpeg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time if he can make the action better Ill let him Im also going to put on some Elixir Light strings I dont know what kind of strings are on it out of the boxBut the bottom line is that I am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right out of the box Im glad I bought it Very nice guitar,positive
These are obviously designed for microphones with the Shure SM5758 series form factor I use mine for the much heavierBlue Microphones enCORE 100 StudioGrade Dynamic Performance Microphone and this clip holds it right where I adjust it toThe threads in the base of the clip appear to be precisionmachined Mine effortlessly mate with anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom Black anOn Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone Standand aMusicians Gear DieCast Mic Stand Black which are the only stands with which Ive used this clipBear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the Shure SM and PG and similar or a different brand that uses that form factor then this clip will probably not work Also I cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares actually you SHOULD do thatI am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model I have five or six on hand including a few spares and if I needed more clips this is the one I would purchase Zero problems and mine get a lot of home studio use,positive
The one I got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw I feel like if I tighten it too much I could dent my mic stand tube But I havent dented anything yet so perhaps Im just too skeptical In any event it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction But everything works Its getting the job done and I havent seen a better option All in all a pretty good device Works as Intended,positive
Works just as it should love it and a great price to boot Great windshield for the mic,positive
It is just as describedI am happy Amazon always comes throughwithout a hitchit was delivered as usual before stated time cloth,positive
Really great quality item It was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up Its durable and I suspect will last me for the rest of my days Perfect,positive
Behringer makes a LOT of electronics for guitar and bass I have an FCB10 that I use and like great controller for the price The CS400 at roughly 2000 is a decent pedal that will get the job done Is it equivalent to a Boss Dynacomp Visual Sound or Keeley compressornope You will get 2000 worth of use out of it though for sure The housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a PITA Just dont take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year Good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point budget compressorsustainer pedal,neutral
This is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers Ive used it for 8 months with no issues at all It sounds great it works perfectly and it was 40 As for quality control I have several Joyo pedals and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome Ive never used a Phase 90 so the clone factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser It works its simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear Ive been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals If you dont like it get a refund Its not rocket surgery 8 months later still no issues,positive
I love the tone do your research though Plenty of distortion plenty of bass and treble makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter Excellent Pedal,positive
I use this cable a lot and it has stood the test of time If it matters to you the white ends are very well white They look nice in the product photos but sometimes clash with certain guitars and stomp boxes colorsdesigns Just saying I Use It a Lot It Holds Up,positive
This is my second order of the 10 pack A local store wants 2999 for one set of these The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands Ive tried including and especially the most commonly used ebs I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings On occasion it looks as if the winding is chipping off but not at the frets I change strings quite often so it really doesnt matter Not sure what thats about but it doesnt affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars Any less and Id look dumb Best deal I can find anywhere,positive
These screws are not a shiny chrome so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body They are good quality screws Great screws for black guitar body,positive
Well executed black guitar strap It is made of strong seatbeltlike material with excellent stitching that is unlikely to ever fray or come apart The length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children It has excellent leather ends with slots cut into the leather to put over you guitar buttons notincluded Nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively Guitar Strap,positive
Sadly I cant review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both nonresponsive I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work and I got nothing it was like the mic wasnt plugged in at all And the cable included in this pack well the plastic not metal connector to the mic was cracked I still tried it with a difference mic staticI cant blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damagedThe stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package I was impressed at how much of is isnt plasticStill I cant recommend this product Dead on Arrival,negative
Ive tried a lot of delay pedals and this delay is easy to use the sound is clean and crisp easy to dial in Nice crisp Delay sound,positive

Great little amp I replaced a 35 year old Fender chorus with this No comparison I have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud The factory setup is great but you can set it up anyway you want it WOW,positive
Well its made nicely but output is not strong sensitivity brings notes together on the bright side but theres little ciean sustain im going to work with it more thats compressors Not bad,positive
This is working for me quite well and is part of my keyboard stage rig nowIm mounting it to a heavy duty On Stage brand double X stand The resulting arrangement is reasonably stable although if you put a bit of pressure on the mic stand you can rotate the Attachment Bar I could tighten the handle further to prevent this but am worried that this will begin to deform the X stand and it is not a problem on stage I am not worried that it would damage the Attachment Bar as it is quite heavy dutyIn general its strong enough to hold a typical stage mic on a small boom arm Holds a microphone boom adequately,positive
234 wide Nylon strap is well made comfortable and should last many years The ends are leather sewn onto the strap It has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone short or tall Comes in several colors Very well made guitar strap,positive
This is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify footstomping percussion traditional to French Canadian music The base is really heavy which makes it stay in place well but its a pain to carry around Also since buying this I found out that I could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet which would have been a bit cheaper For foot percussion,positive
if you can drill into wood with a 58 wood drill bit then these are for you I bought mine for an amp 14 stack and now when I record I can simple roll the head and Cabinet into the small room and recordyou get 4 in the package with 4 wheels and 4 retainers thats 5834 thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet Best Castors and strongest,positive
Ive been using Dunlop Tortex picks for years with the 60 and 73 being my mainstays for acoustic electric picking They feel great theyre easy to hold on to and they have exactly the amount of give attack needed for my style of playing If I have any complaint its that the edges wear down with use sometimes quite rapidly Still they play so well its worth the cost of regular replacement My primary plectrum for years,positive
I just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away Excellent fer recording acoustics Awesome,positive
This gig bag was just what I needed to carry around a soprano ukelele It has a strap for slinging the instrument over your shoulder when in the gig bag padding and a pocket in the front for your tuner The zipper is strong enough and it was just what I needed to carry around the ukelele to keep it protected while in transit Good little gig bag with padding strap and front pocket,positive
I was leery of this since it was half the total price of just about every other one I considered Because of the return policy I took a chance and am not only glad I did but am also thoroughly impressed with this hangerFirst I doubt if I could build one for anywhere near the price of this if I purchased the materials locally Factor in that shipping at the time of my purchase is free and this is a no brainerInstallation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hangerThere is one concern you may have If you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes Personally mine are being used to hang a cheap Squire Strat and Jbass and an Epiphone Les Pail Junior II instruments more decorative than functional I am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decisionThe bottom line though is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain In fact they are probably the best deal you are likely to find and are worth every cent Amazing deal and they are decent quality,positive
I bought one of those padded Fender leather straps it says FS1 CANADIAN leather on the back I thought these Fender strap locks would complement the strap but because of the padding the thread on the straplock wasnt high enough for the nut to reach I finally got the nut to get a hold of the top of the thread and although it works I dont trust that its enough If you have a padded leather strap I dont recommend these Good locking strap button,positive

My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie I loved it Its a switchless pedal that I put through hell I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke Its still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal open to achieve a certain warm sound Thats when I went looking at the cry babyAt the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up I put this one against the Hendrix Classic and 95Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over 200 it was out of my price range I paid 97tax for my GCB95 cry baby and it was worth every penny I dont even touch my Morley anymore Its cry baby all the way Great affordable Wah wah pedal,positive
I bought these to go from my board to the amp We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating They are still going strong Still going,positive
Its a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me Great sampler,positive
I just got it today Really tight because its brand new but its really sturdy and solid Nothing gimmicky or faulty just perfect sturdy and solid,positive
I cant find a single complain about this amp The amp modelling is fantastic Plug in for a micCDM3 player Quality driver Im not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website I used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects Only thing I wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds But you cant ask for much more for the price of 399 You wont be disappointed with this amp Incredible Product,positive
Ill start off by saying that Ive had this interface for about 6 months now and it is still going strong I think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit Not only does it provide 2 channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out This could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audioHowever I have a few gripes with the 2i2 The headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it This is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance But it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls IMO the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly Moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aestheticsWhy 4 starsThe problem must of started happening today because I never noticed it before Or it could be just that maybe I never noticed it Anyways shortly after I engaged the 48v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing Once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away I hope that this issue does not show up in all of the Scarlett 2i2 interfaces I would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios Hopefully just my unit is defective and it isnt something that is common among the 2i2sAnother thing to note is that while Direct Monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use In other words I am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor Nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized thoughSo in the end 45 stars The packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that I really like the build quality of the interface and Focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit The only issue that I would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged Overall great entry level interfacesound card Scarlett 2i2 the start of something great,positive
You dont really need an expensive sustain pedal unless youre a concert pianist playing on a 10k keyboard nuff said Best sustain pedal under 200If youre spending 200 on a sustain pedal you got money to burn,positive
I ordered this because I have an Ovation and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstockDue to the small size and adjustable clip this tuner fit perfectly and well out of the way It took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the ONOFF button but no problem nowAs a tuner I really like it The small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light havent tried it in bright light yet the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable and it did a great job in a noisy gig where I changed tunings about 10 times during the evening Perfect for my purposes,positive
What can I sayI love this thing I bought three more after trying the first one I put one in each of my guitar bagscant live without it The tuning is excellent and so easy If you are hesitating buy it and you will love it Best thing since sliced bread,positive
I was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal I only wanted this so that I could pair it with my RE20 to control the intensity and in that aspect I can confirm that it workspairs flawlessly My only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive For example I tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a VST synthesizer and it was recognized and mapped without issue but rocking the pedal eversoslightly would cause erratic movement on the filter This is the same behavior that I have when connected to the RE20 in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion thats anything but gradual Its not the end of the world but I was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise Works Great With The Roland RE20 Space Echo,positive
I clipped it on the neck head of my acoustic guitarIt tunes up well and is very easy to readI turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingI have not used it enough to test the battery lifeBut so far so good Great for the priceAll Pros and No Cons so far An accurate Tuner that is very easy to use,positive
I gave this a 5 star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar I replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing I did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar double the size of the chinese tremolo system,positive
this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build fromthe pencil condenser are questionablethey have picked up outside noiselike birds etc but with a decent bit of white noise but I may have had them running a bit hot too the strange clamps have worked well for me great deal,positive
I bought these because they were an 34addon34 offer and Im glad I did I dont play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass These are a little too soft for guitar check out the Dunlops but Im going to make sure I have some of these around too Good for bass too,positive

This is an attractive leather head stock strap The leather is very soft and flexible I would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather Nice Strap,positive
I used to use a Schubb Capo but started using the Dunlop Trigger a few years ago and never looked back The fit can be a little tight especially higher up on the fretboard but I personally like this mostly for the fact there are less moving parts compared to a Schubb and the fit is nice and secure Best Capo Out There For The Money,positive
This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good also doesnt fit an instrument where theres no place to hook it I returned mine as it just didnt fit well for my uke or mandolin Didnt like this particular strap,negative
The Korg CM100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners is a great product I would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument My instructor who has been playing a violin for about 40 years brought one to my private lesson recently Because it did not pick up extraneous room noises it made tuning my violin for the lesson so much faster and easier Novice Violinist,positive
I snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on Amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price I previously had theLucero LC100 Classical Guitar Black Blackwhich I was completely happy with as a beginner When it got damaged beyond repair I looked into theCordoba Dolce 78 Size Classical Guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but I decided I didnt really like the size so after liking the Cordoba brand I decided on the C5It is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range The Lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the C5 has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that I was surprised to hear from a budget guitar While it isnt it the prettiest guitar out there its by no means ugly Even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitarThe smell of this guitar is also amazing It doesnt have the cheap wood glue smell of other lowend guitars but a nice rich smell of wood Even after a few months kept in a humicase the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still presentAll praise aside it is not a flawless guitar My main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars especially those at a lower price range Not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of being a cedar guitar the wood is very soft so I recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitarI do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package It is a highquality gig bag with lots of padding Inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place It also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books When I ordered this guitar from Amazon the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box I had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safelyOverall I do not regret this purchase and once I take it in for a setup to get the action lowered it will be a superb guitar that I will enjoy for years Highly recommended For a budget guitar a great beauty and wonderful tone,positive
This is really quite a fantastic little gizmo It functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun It is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way You just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations showing you when you are sharp flat or dead on Quite amazing especially for the price Highly recommend and Im stingy with my 5 star reviews Fantastic little gizmo,positive

I am a newbie to the world of playing the blues harp however I am not a beginner to music I have played guitar fervently for the past 22 years so I knew a little something when I thought I would try to learn the harmonica Technique is of utmost importance and I found learning how to pucker and tongue block on this instrument was effortless It sounds for the most part in tune and its tone is great My kids love to hear me play it However there is 1 con to this wonderful instrument After owning it for several days the DRAW 2 hole went flat I researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit so I worked on my technique some more To my dismay the one note on the harmonica that allows you to bend into 2 other tones and is considered the sweet spot of the instrument did not work right Obviously you cannot take it back to the seller its not really hisher fault I am not sure how to repair it but I feel that I should have to do so this early in the game Maybe its my naivete in hoping for a perfect instrument So I took one star away because of this problematic issue Otherwise I really like this harmonica nice harmonica,positive
What can I say Fits perfectly for a pickguard on a Fender style guitar You could probably find them at a cheap hardware store but I was too lazy to go looking Works,positive

I bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar I have a Sabine tuner with a minimike but unplugging the tuner from my amp having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps Id rather not go through This tuner is compact and works well I clip it onto whatever guitar I pick up for a quick tune acoustic OR electric push the power button and off I go I havent fooled with the other features Metronome Detuning so I cant comment about them An added comment I broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended My fault but it shouldnt have broken so easily Im sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit strongerthicker or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely Handy little tuner but it broke,neutral
I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment Works perfectly Ive seen reviews about this brand being noisy I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handleIve owned it for a couple of months used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times Zero hum or buzz from the unit I should also mention that I do not have any drivedistortion pedals on my board It works with no added noise,positive

This thing is a TANK I dont think you could break this beast if you wanted to The last string winder you will ever buy The MacDaddy of String Winders,positive
Ive been using D Addario strings for 20 years to great satisfaction These flex steels are excellent Bass tones response and resonance are superior to my ear You cant go wrong with these guys D Addario is the best,positive
I bought these strings to try on my guitars They sound good on a variety of models like SGLes Paul Rickenbacker They have a melodic tone and good intonation and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape Good strings,positive
I dont believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo but this one is quite good For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built It is as with all capos important to take it off when not in use so the rubber does not get grooved This is just good common sense If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another Good effective capo,positive
If you are familiar with the Pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is If you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with Voodoo so those bricks are will always fit Keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilledThe duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable If you have a power strip it wont fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug That said I have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables Its a Pedaltrain,positive
I play resonator guitars open tuned These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open 34A34 tuning I recently tried multiple other brands and gauges almost every B string snapped to C only to come back to these Only wish they came in packs of 10 cause I go through about three sets a month 3 guitars Great Strings,positive
I used this on my last stratocaster build It arrived quickly and was well packaged It is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard be aware The cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back I was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit These already come with foil so there is no need to shield them any more than they already areIt fit my body perfectly and I am happy with the purchase Looks Sharp,positive

I love these things I have purchased several Snarks of all different types Fast accurate and a joy to use My young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one All Snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner The SN2 also has a built in mic for use with any instrument such as trumpet sax clarinet etc I have other more expensive clip on tuners but the Snark is by far my favorite Snark,positive
I tried the EXPs on my Gibson L4 archtop because I play jazz single lines small chord comping and full chords more than I do on a Martin OM1 and figured Id get a better overall feel for tone and responseFor years Ive played Martin Phosphor Bronze mediums on both guitars and thats my reference The DAddario EXP lights show their difference mostly on the bass end where theyre a good 7 mm thinner The high E and B are 3 mm less and I can feel it but not enough to bother me All things being equal I prefer heavier strings for tone but I play instruments I dont trust with truly heavy gaugesThe first thing I noticed is considerably less new string clang compared to both the Martins and DAddarios regular phosphur bronze strings which Ive used in the past and still use for mandolinWhile still a long way from sounding brokenin the EXP strings sound as though theyve had several days of good use As a kid I perspired much more and would just rot strings like you wouldnt believe on a humid summer day I could get rid of that clang in a hourThe tension on the EXPs feels very comfortable and considerably more flexible than the 7 mm difference should account for I like to bend strings on acoustic in certain contexts which can be tough with tight strings the EXPs feel very easy not electric guitar easy mind you but fine for acousticThe other quality thats noticeable is sustain The strings I took off werent completely dead and I wasnt expecting a dramatic difference but its noticable across the board especially on small chord comping on three or four strings at a timeThe tone also feels a bit more balanced across all six strings but this is admittedly very subjective I play with differently shaped and thicknessed picks for different recording contexts some generate more percussive pick noise than others sometimes I want it other times no The response of the EXPs sounds very consistent to my earsIve had them on for a couple of weeks now playing fairly regularly Some of the initial clang is gone but the desired bright lively tone has not degraded noticeablyI suppose the real test of the EXP coating is how they sound beyond the point where other strings begin to sound dead Maybe Ill update this review down the line but for me its a false question because if the strings dont sound and feel good in the short term who cares if they last forever Some Pleasant Surprises,positive
Tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely its pretty sensitiveThe metronome will drive you crazy It has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible Think of the most sterile electronic clicksbeeps you can and then add nailsonchalkboard for good measure There are much better sounding metronomes out there I bought this Korg for the tuner function and thats about all Ill use it for Nice tuner annoying metronome,neutral
I keep this cable on my pedal board Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case Ive posted a photo on the pedaltrain Mini page The right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp I use a Mogami silent cable Mogami Platinum Guitar 12 Straight to Straight with Quiet Plug 12 feet for the input to my guitar but I cant justify paying a LOT more money for the side that goes to my amp its not getting bumped around plugged and unplugged etc This cable works perfect for its purpose Oh yeah and it matches my tweed amp Great cable matches my Blues Jr,positive
This strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily I plan on using strap locks so it wont matter to me but if you dont use strap locks your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole dayMy advice Install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment Then choose comfortable straps that wont scratch your guitar like this one Nice strap but it falls off easily,positive
As I stated about some other guitar strings I purchased here these DAddarios for my electric guitar give me the sound service and price point I need You stick with what you know and like,positive
Kudos to Fender for making an amp like this available at this price point It has 25 watts of power a 10 inch speaker a real spring reverb and its a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor It will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way its supposed toThe downside is that when I compare this amp to what Fender was selling fifteen years ago the Champion 110 it falls a little short The particle board cabinet is thinner the speaker is less hefty and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial Its obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is and they also moved production to Indonesia from Mexico Maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the oceanAll the same I can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10 speaker and real Fender tone and looks Fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a wellmade tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling but I kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practicelight gigging amp Good value analog 10 speaker amp,positive
Ive used the Tortex picks for a while now and have been really happy with them This pick however takes it to the next level Very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick I use the 73 for acoustic and the same holds true Great product Great Picks,positive
This is a must have Really It is pack very well and I use it everydayPlease get one of these if you are tried of paying someone to do your guitar setup A tool to help me get my goal in becoming a Luthier,positive
Nice Polishcleaner Really works very well on the finishes I have cheap glossy chinese electrics and a matte finish acoustic handy to have when your changing strings to clean that nasty fretboard wow do those things get dirty Pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue Lasts a long time 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar Does what it says,positive
I have played guitar for about 12 years and these picks are now my favorite picks ever I cant really explain why they just feel right Sometimes they break but what pick light pick doesnt unless its nylon These picks just feel right,positive
The FAB overdrive pedal does not work well for me In fairness to the product I was aware from reviews that it gives varying results based on guitar and amp I have a Epiphone Les Paul Special II with a Fender Frontman 25R amp No matter how I adjust it it has a muddy sound Ive heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results I took a chance based on the low cost and I do plan to do some upgrades to my guitar The guitar is new and has the strings that came with it I plan to get a better grade immediately and that may be all I need to get the expected sound There are several reviews of this product on You Tube You can do a search there and hear what it is capable of A decent Pedal for the Price,positive
Good quality cable Actually much better than I expected for the price I dont move around much so I dont know about how rugged it would be out on the road but the cable is flexible and should stand up to a lot of rolling and unrolling Solid cable,positive
I love this capo better than any I have seen or used Great quality and price You wont go wrong with this capo love it,positive
This product works as advertised but you should beware These are RIGHT ANGLED and they WILL NOT fit in a lot of pedals including the CRYBABY WAHYou have been warned Work great however,positive
My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 PlusThe documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply However if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested youre in for an unpleasant surpriseFirst of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board The fitment to the power supply is there sort of Theres no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together I wasnt worried about this since I doubt Ill ever chain them and only have access to 1 outletThe second issue is the allegedly selftapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter Once youve got them in or attempted to do so theyre never coming out Youll probably have to break them Its a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensiveThe main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board it can only go one place you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply dont fit the mounting location on this board You cant plug them in because theres not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in toI really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own but given that it doesnt fit like its supposed to I wish I could return this board except I cant because it now has holes drilled in it You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath itBasically I paid 100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro Needless to say Im not very pleased Voodoo Lab power supply didnt fit as advertised,negative
I got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect But either way I liked it and decided to keep it Its a really good deal at the price And it sounds just as good as major brands The only problem most people find is the material that its made of Its like a hard plastic not metal like most are But if youre not a person who abuses your gear it should last you a good whileI cannot use it for recording because there is some hiss from it like all other Behringer pedals and I record direct not through amp But for live playing its great Its especially perfect for garage and bar bands Good sound effects low price,positive
So I heard these were good and ordered one to try I was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking downA must have Amazing quality,positive
Great overdrivedistortion for classic rock music Good volume roll off tones at full bore it sounds like VH and some other 80s rock dudes Its quiet and has a very active tone control The crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic not too much but just enough MXR has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do I now own a Script Phase 90 and a Micro Chorus as well and plan on getting others Im a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s vibe Good choice,positive
pretty much this is a great case for the price but i would like more padding because i like my guitars to be safe but if you want a better case for protection invest in a hard case i cant give it a bad review for not enough padding because this guitar has about the same amount of padding as most soft cases this is also a pretty handsome looking caseif thats what you care about great case for the price,positive
This is the third Snark tuner the others were Snark II I have bought Both of the others broke where the stem joins the clocktype display could be glued together but irritating This one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable Why buy this after the experience of the others Well they are very good and easy to use tuners and for not much money my guitar strings cost more This one has a great display full colour and easy to read I use it on a guitar a bass and a 12 string and it works well on all of them Guitar tuner,positive
I dont know much about guitar tuners but I am sure you can pay for a more expensive one but this one does the job It was not hard to figure out how to use it and the Fender is a happier guitar for it Tune Me,positive
I chose this capo because I was just starting out and needed one for certain songs This was a cheap capo but it does its job well I have no complaints about it at all Works great does its job,positive
I pick a lot when I play the bass fast rock stuff and these are perfect They bend just the right amount so I dont make any loud plucking sounds while playing They really grip too Short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do Great for bass,positive
I ordered the one in the photo with brown sides and got a standard black one I have the black one on my Fender Stratocaster and wanted the brown one for my acoustic Unfortunately they sent the wrong one but Ill use it anyway Its also not the same size as the one in the photo much widerI wish I had the right one as the one I got doesnt match the guitar I know if I put up a fuss they would send the right one but it would cost more to send this back than I paid for itI will say that these are a must have if youre tired of searching for picks Finish playing slide your pick into this and its there when you play again disappointed not the one I ordered,neutral
These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guidetree Installed on a Tele I built Much less surface of the string touching Very smooth action when using the vibrato Took no more than 10 minutes to install Reasonably priced super upgrade I recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar These look like rollers but are not rollers They do work well and I will purchase more for other Teles and StratsPros Well made Cons None I can think ofSleek well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade Nice upgrade,positive
My main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate It also occasionally fails to register at all Ive tried putting in slightly different positions on the head of my guitars but the contact is sporadic I AB ed the Snark against two other tuners and the snark fails to show notes that are a little flat and sometimes shows false sharp readings The other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear Most people like this tuner and on the plus side I also liked its convenience and the ease with which the results can be read Unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch Convenient but not very accurate,neutral
I figured Id buy a cheap second guitar so I found this one One of the cheapest prices on Amazon And I thought wow what a great look this guitar has I was also hoping that it played well Well Ive been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good and Ive had no technical issues what so ever I would recommend to ANYONE Keep up the good work Great QualityPrice Looks Amazing,positive
Very well made No problems Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse Excellent product,positive
this is my first real recording microphone I really like it I use it to record vocal with my home studio setup and it does a good job good mic,positive
Great little amp but get a tube amp if youre serious about playing guitar It will sound a lot better and its not too much more expensive Solid state just isnt the sameIll also say that its quite difficult to get a natural sound out of this amp without a lot of tweaking Even then you wont get a great clean tone The Fender Champ X2 is a great alternative to the more expensive and desiralble vintage Fender Vibro Champ Go with Quality and save yourself a future purchase resale vale is great on the X2 as well Get a tube,positive
I have a VOX AC4TV It uses stock a 12AX7 but I thought I would try the 12AT7 just to see what happened I had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroomAfter a little test run my first impression was that the amp was noticeably quieter with this tube installed It might have reduced the volume by a third or more but this came with the benefit of the amp being noticeably less noisy That was a nice benefitI didnt notice much of a change tonally I think this tube basically brought the volume down I wouldnt say this is better or worse than the 12AX7 just quieter and with significantly less outputI ended up switching back to the 12AX7 Definitely changed my amp,neutral
good product great price as long as you take care of them they seem as though they will last quite a while pedal cables,positive
Ive used GHS medium bronze wound strings on my Martin D18 for several years I thought Id give these Ernie Ball strings a shot after reading reviews They are lighter than I expected They are closer to light than medium Im not that impressed They sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets I think the next set I buy will be medium and probably GHS You never know until you tryUpdate Ive gotten used to the sound of these strings and I DO like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing Pure Bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow BG sound though At my age I need all the help I can get so Ill have to admit that I like do like these strings First Time Trying Ernie Ball Strings,positive
This comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture I LOVE the way this mounts to power strip You can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as 2 spaces It is rated to 1700 mA but I try to keep to 1500 or lessI looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly PEDAL BOARD CLEAN UP,positive
I only just received these but thought Id give my first impression I purchased headphones because I figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than inear type I chose this model because they were on sale seemed to be a diamond in the rough and reviews indicated it would be good for large headsI wear an XL hat sizeThe build is average They dont feel flimsy in my hands but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special strengthwise The padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head it sort of looks warped The 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone The headphones can both swivel 90 degrees forward maybe 35 degrees back and 90 degrees downward The swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headbandI listened to about 45 minutes of music straight to start and was pretty pleased Im not especially particular but do like good sound Theres some good bass classical music was clear The headphones did make me realize I had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that I tried outlistening to the HD equivalent on YouTube cleared up problems I heard I wasnt totally blown away either I do hear a little noise when theyre plugged into my computer and nothing is playing though not so for my iPodso Im not sure if this can be blamed on the headphonesThey are comfortable but not as comfortable as Id like I do feel some pushing against my ears the round ear pads arent big enough to fit my whole ear They do get warmer than Id like I definitely feel relieved to have them off I think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour I was a little hesitant to get overear headphones in fear of this and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problemWho knows maybe theyll wear in and improve Ill update this review if I have more to report For now Id say theyre worth the cost even if they arent a shining diamond in the rough If I could give about 35 stars I would but for now Ill give 3 They are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product Some exceptional pros are balanced by some consUpdate 719Ive been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days its helped a bit Whats funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge Its comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notchesbut the pushing against your head is the tight part If you adjust them larger they just fall below your ears rather than loosen upAlso I compared them to the Sennheiser HD201 The TASCAMs have better sound but the Sennheiser is more comfortabletheyre lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit betterUpdate 723I think the box stretching has been helping Im able to wear them for about 2 hours now before I notice them getting uncomfortable Still a relatively short amount of timeUpdate 892013The headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they arent in use The comfort is marginally improving Im guessing due to the stretching out my headears getting used to the pressure and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure However I think my rating will remain at 3 stars The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars and the price low enough for one more However a month should be long enough for the phones to breakin to a standard usable degree and that hasnt happened to my satisfactionCONCLUSION I would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big headmine is about 2461cm circumference or US hat size 7 and 58 The clamping definitely leads to discomfort the round ear pads dont quite do the trick and it makes your head pretty warm Its not unbearable but if you can find an alternative its probably best That being said note that I have only reduced stars for the fit I cant speak for someone with a bit smaller of a headand earsif these fit comfortably which I imagine they would for many people they are a 5 star product Great sounding sturdy enough build etcUpdate 111413A friend of mine picked up a pair of AudioTechnica M50s around the same time I bought this pair and I was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today Im not very experienced with sound quality but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner The most obvious difference was the added volume but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears The bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less staticlike etc Besides the volume these differences werent huge I had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them The point of this update is just to say that you arent getting 150 headphones for 30 with the TASCAMs You are getting very good headphones the sound of which should more than satisfy most people I think youre pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphonesin this case youd pay 5X more for the M50sbut I dont think youre getting 5X the sound quality The M50s are significantly more comfortablethough they do make your ears warmer and the build feels betterstronger smoother adjustments prettier etc All these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable Decent value,neutral
You cant go wrong with these Ive installed them on EVERY Fender I own Even if you dont use the trem very often they help maintain proper tuning if you overbend which Im prone to do I havent had any tuning or slippage issues when I have these on and you shouldnt eitherEasy to install also and for the money give them a gotheyre just as solid as the pricier onesand theyre Fender so how can you go wrong Lock it and forget it,positive
theres the snark for clipons the blackout or boss tu2 for pedals or a rack option my preamp unit has a tuner but i love these for tuning off stage or something got at least 3 of these around i can use this for bass or guitar i tune to low drop f and it even picks it up on bass best tuner,positive
Update After heavy play for 6 months this is my favorite amp by a mile I also have a ZT Lunchbox that I use for church work miles of clean headroom and designed specifically for pedals The Mustang III would work just fine but I can throw the ZT in a backpack with my pedals I only use an OD chorus and reverb for church and it has a lot more volume of I do youth group stuff outside and cant mic upI have several friends that play music as a primary source of income and 3 of them purchased the Mustang for its overall lightweight terrific sound and low price Played on the clean channels settings 8899 with pedals will give you an amazing tone that lets you forget its not a tube amp and for the most part the crowd is clueless to begin with I did purchase the VOX AC4 and it was so one dimensional and limited it went right back Terrific for gigs or practice a back up or just beginning guitarSo this is the 3rd amp Ive purchased in a very short amount of time I traded in my Line 6 and also purchased a Roland Micro Cube Chalk it up to a new guitar player and a whole world of amplifiers from every price range and style I bought the Line 6 becuase it had a lot of features and presets that I thought would be really fun They are but Line 6 is for metal despite You can play anything on it marketing Turns out I really enjoy playing country and blues although I listen to punk classic rock and metal pre1995Enter the Mustang III It also is feature loaded but with one kicker The models of the vintage Fender amps I have a very close friend that plays a 65 Twin Reverb he was shocked at the modeling The Bassman is another that is just off the charts good The LCD screen is bigger and overall very simple to use The Vox model is also really jangly sounding like its supposed to I have to add that with Vox in particular you can get the crunch without having to use massive volume This is true of modeling amps across the board and a huge advantage over tubes in general For 300 you can get a Vox w an overdrive delay and reverb And you can get the full effect with the volume dialed to 3 not 11 It doesnt sound exactly like a Vox but I dont gig Im a basement rockstar the Mustang gets it done without any problemsAdding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive Thats without the FUSE software Im not big into recording so Im content using it from the LCD but the Fuse software is slick The virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp The screen is easy to navigate and you can see exactly what effects youre using where they are set atThe only reason Ive given it 4 stars is beacuse is lacks low end punch and more importantly doesnt quite have the warmth of a tube amp To be clear tube amps sound like tube amps If you are a metal guy on a solid state budget Line 6 is still the way to go If youre more into the old school rnr sounds take a look at the Mustang III Excellent sounds and value Its like Line 6but for the non metal crowd,positive

This was recommended to me by the top engineer at GenzBenz bass amplification company Andy said that this product is far superior to any other He was right Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 60 amp Also fixed the effects loop jacks which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90 of its power on gigs Not good After several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating cleaning and coating effect on the components Wow And no Andy does not own stock in have affiliation with or represent in any way the manufacturers of DeOxit Nor do I This product works great Worth the extra money,positive
Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic that was not always the case and Ive actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a Shure Model 545 Unidyne III That mic got stolen about 2 years ago but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an onoff switch function Ive owned or used countless modern day SM58s and SM57s along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I dont need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM57 To me the SM57 sounds similar to the 469 Shure SM7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away Id only use an SM7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive By design the SM58s require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM57s I prefer the SM57s over the SM58s for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end The SM57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled The SM57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic Ive ever used If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM58 If you are ever going to use an SM57 for vocals Id recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM57 The SM57 will pop like mad without one The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an onoff switch these days I cant find a modern SM57 with a switch anywhere However if youve ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability For my money the SM57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes For studio vocals Id use an SM7 which really doesnt sound all that much different from the SM57 when the builtin variable EQ on the SM7 is set the way I like The SM57 and its predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen Best all around for over 30 years,positive
only thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place but worked great for what I wanted to screw around with it worked great,positive
Ill try to review the strings and not the instrument but thats kinda hard for me to do Ive been playing guitar since my Dad bought me a 700 unknown acoustic 46 years ago That should make me about 58 He put some brand new humpty duty Black Diamond strings on it which pulled the neck up to where the strings sat around 6 off the fretboard Well they werent very close anyway The neck had no way to adjust it so imagine learning to play using heavy gauge Black Diamond strings a ways from the fretboard I didnt know any better so I thought it was normal for the blood dripping off my bent crooked fingertipsSince then Ive been through a multitude of guitars and strings I always wanted a Les Paul but my playing never improved enough to justify 200000 400000 I started reading reviews on the Epiphone Les Paul 100 for 24900 and they were running from 45 5 stars I finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through Amazon Ive owned Strats Telecasters cheapies an Alvarez I think I unpacked it out of the box did a little tuning and this is absolutely the most beautiful sweetest thing Ive ever held in my life except for the little lady of course No kidding I recommend this guitar to anyone even if it cost a couple of grandStrings The ones that came on there sounded great I didnt put it down for a couple of weeks Sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics I finally got the best out of that set of strings I always use Ernie Ball on everything Theyve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house I saw some Hybrids on Amazon and had never heard of them I bought a pack of them along with some Super Slinkys Regular Slinkys Earthwood Silk Steels I put the Hybrids on the new Les Paul They made it sound even better than it was Chuck Barry The Ventures Clapton set the LP and Fender amp right and the sound is just as good The lower strings have a wonderful rich tone theyre fairly heavy but easy on the fingers The high strings will talk to you I can bend the gstring easier than a Super Slinky This is the only guitar Ive used them on but they sound great I imagine Ill stick with them for this machine from now on Of course Amazon is always 5 stars in my book Two Reviews In One,positive
Spent next to nothing on this part but it saved the day on a side project for a friend Thank God I buy spares this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly It doesnt get any more elemental but I soldered it in and its doing fine Not for real heavy usage anyway Simple but necessary It works for me,positive
The best deal for recording beginners This mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instrumentsIts definitely flat and natural sounding which I like Just be aware it comes with a plastic shock mount not a metal one like the AT2020 comes with However its usable Natural Natural and Natural,positive
The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings for steel strings I want more pressure I advise getting the NS Capo that is not lite I prefer that one above this model Buy the heavy one,negative
I am worried that I will damage my instruments if they are left standing around This will allow me to show off and protect them Just what I was looking for,positive
Well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack They work Get Screwed Thats what they are for,positive
Holds my guitars just fine It is a bit odd to think that something off balance one of the legs is shorter then the others will be fine but it works Stand,positive
Well this amp does have its pros and cons however the cons are overshadowed by the prosPros1 Small 2 sounds like a big combo amp 3 makes overdrive pedals sound better 4 sustain 5 big bottom bass 6 HD construction and components 7 I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesnt get all noisy or feedback 8 it soundsREALLY goodCons1 yes it could be louder 2 Not brightNow the details I have a tube combo amp and in comparison the ZT is a bit on the dull side as far as presenceIts not that it does not have it just could use more However this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion Solos just sing on this amp I feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better The ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way I stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good I also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when I first turn it on seems to go away I know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally It also seems to have a positive compressionpumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ringVolume For a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill Micing for larger venues would work just fineIf youre in a LOUD band you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option darn I meant to test before this review TIP so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the18 aux input on the back I tested this and yes it does go louder for whatever the reason Ill be getting a blank 18jack to put it that aux port A small but very noticeable volume increase If you need to be LOUDER then I suggest the larger ZT but its double the price A friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore The 12 club ZT is super loudI can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesnt get all noisy or feedback1100 I rate this a 98 gear head satisfaction Remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 65 speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little boxCheck it out the reviews on youtubePART II Ok the extension cabinet option Hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder However do NOT use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet Turn the switch off It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird I found out the hard way verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker I would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both Youll know if you touch the back of the amp and its more than warm but I would not recommend it Portability 1 way too convinient,positive
If you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth this is a fantastic amp for youFender has done an amazing job with this ampIN this AMP you haveAll of the benefits of tubes warmth at all dynamic levels as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playingThe CHAMP Circuit Forget the fact that you have Digital amp models built in too you also have a 15w Champ tube amp with a 10 inch speaker Its not exactly a 57 champ reissue but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any Champ out there People who like a great Champ tone would pay more than 299 for a great 15w Champ ampAdd to this 16 Digital Presets Fender gives you Digital models through a Tube Circuit of Tweed Amps Blackface Amps Hot Rod Amps as well as Metal Amps A Jazz amp and an Acoustic sounding ModelAdd to that some preset digital effects including Reverb Delay Vibe Trem and Chorus Each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effectEveryone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the Digital Models are and they are absolutely rightBut this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a Tweed or Hot Rod tone directly to an authentic Champ amp Not a model of a Champ Amp the real dealThe implications of this amp are really huge Id love to see Fender do the same thing with a Pro Jr or even a Blues Jr Amp Perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp who knows But what I do know is that this amp is simply bursting with characterThe Digital PresetsFor me the highlights are the authenticity of the Tweed Blackface and Hot Rod tones I really feel like channel 10 sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the 10 inch speaker The tweed tones are syruppy and awesome The Blackface clean sounds like a Princeton and I even think they were trying to emulate a Deluxe Reverb on channel 5As Far as VolumePeople ask is it loud enough to gig with Sure It can get loud enough over drums etc But Id mic it anyway I get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume Mic it and you can play it anywhereThe Only downsidesAs much as Fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads this amp really doesnt give Metalheads that much to work with It would be a great practice amp for any guitarist Blues Metal Jazz or CountryBut the Metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffsLack of a Mid Control Im not sure that I understand why youd have an EQ with Treble and Bass with no Mid control Personally its the EQ knob that I would use the most but if you are switching between Digital Presets you have to work with the Treble and Bass to find the sweet spot for your mids To my ears its not in the same spot on all presets That one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presetsThis amp is cool and unique Which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when Fender releases the next big new thing Line 6 and Vox tubedigital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out Fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability This is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with 10 years laterTruly a unique and versatile creation Whoa Best tube value ever,positive
I should start by saying that I did not buy this from Amazon Not that its a bad price but I got a discount on an open box demo unit at a local Guitar Center for 17900 Ive seen them cheaper for used ones but I wanted a new one with a warrantyI am using this amp for an electric violin and for an acoustic violin with a pickup I wanted the cleanest sound with bare bones controls and thats what this little champ provides Most of the time I use it with the Gain on 1 or 2 and the Volume past 5Its very cool that it has 5w 1w and 1w settings I havent seen that in any amp in this price range The 1w setting is perfect for my studio and the 1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack The 5w setting can really crank out the volumeYou could spend about 100 more and get a Vox AC4 series all tube amp Thats another amp I was considering I wanted something not too big and portable but could use at home without shredding the walls But the Vox doesnt even have Reverb like the Bugera which has only a single preamp tube And the Vox is 4w while the Bugera boasts 5wI know if I plugged an electric guitar in and cranked the gain I could get some lovely distortion because Ive tried that with the violin The digital reverb has a spacious feel I love reverb and wouldnt buy an amp without itIt seems to be built well and only time will tell if it holds up under daily use which I plan to do When it comes time to change the tube there are many choices for a nice upgrade to something better than the stock Bugera tube Ive even read online where people drop in a different speaker but in my opinion the Bugera 8 speaker is just fine and sounds like a bigger oneAll in all Im very pleased I also tried the Bugera V22 all tube amp at the same Guitar Center But thats way too much amp for me at this time If I were to fill a large hall with sound that would be the way to go The V22 is sweet I had never heard of Bugera until I tried that model and was really impressed Another option is to unplug the speaker in the V5 yes the speaker has a plug and a jack and drive another speaker cabinet which Bugera also makes You can use any speaker cabinet I guess that has a minimum of 4 OHMS which is clearly written near the jackThe Bugera V5 is perfect for me and I wouldnt go down to the smaller Bugera BC15 I think Bugera has hit the nail on the head with quality and value and Ill be looking into other products made by BugeraBehringerMusic Group The seem to be all the same company Great value and great sound,positive
Im primarily a guitar player but I do have a decent mandolin that had factory strings on it Those strings made it hard to play so I tried these DAddario mandolin strings What a difference These strings are great Nice Strings,positive
I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week I tested both of them they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said thats why I bought this And they are solidly built too not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machineI dont expect to come with it so no cable is OK for meHere is the BUT there is no ONOFF switch this really pissed me offBut this is my fault I should have read the 1 star review firstThe photo shows no ONOFF switch however this does not catch any attentionAnd all seller seems to have trouble to say this product does not have this does not have that It only says what the product does haveOh well I got stuck with two microphones without ONOFF switchI can buy an adapter with onoff switch for microphone very good microphone BUT,negative
DAddario Strings are not my usual strings I have always used GHS and Ernie Ball StringsTo my surprise DAddario Strings are very nice however after 20 years of GHS and Ernie Ball Strings its tough for me to make a full time change over to DAddario Strings DAddario Guitar Strings,positive
Well its a solid chunk of metal The lights on it are either all on or all off so they are useless to meYou can power any lightweight 9v 12 or 18v stompbox with this Just watch the milliamps because I dont think this can deliver much more than a few hundred per boxMy only issue with it is that the included patch cords are all the same length Would have been nice to have a few really long onesIt is more expensive than a one spot but I guess this is a neater solution and at the very least I can actually use my all the stompboxes I want now Useful noiseless expensive but good to have,positive
Fender original parts cant be beat The Philips head is an improvement over the 34vintage34 straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish These look like the have a nickel plating and I believe are 818 or 618 size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store but I chose Fender original parts for the Tele I recently finished and for the one I am currently working on Fender Origional PartsPickup Screws,positive
Great microphone I use it with my cheapbudget Behringer mixer the sound is good and if I turn up the gain it will pick up everything in the room It is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals dont start layering the vocals though it starts to sound kind of weird Bang for the buck,positive
I got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc After my first test recording when I played back the audio using the builtin speaker I really thought that I had been duped into believing this device was studio quality Then I listened to that same test recording using headphones and WOW This has got to be heard to be believed There are so many applications for this recorder its ease of operation and quick startup time make it ideal for hurried setups The sound quality is unbelievable,positive
This is a really nice item and I got two of them Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble Thats the problem with mail order Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical beater guitar I have hanging on the faulty one The other unit seems to be rock solid Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar Really good but,neutral
It came and it wasnt broken or bad and it held my brothers guitar for a few years until he sold it It is what it is,positive
This delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion but a nice bit of fuzz Im impressed with what you get for the price good pedal for the price,positive
Ive never had a problem with these patch cables Im running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting outOne thing that is important to note is that Im not hard on my gear Im a home noodler so I cant say if these patches can take roadstage abuse and lots of setupteardown cycles They seem pretty buff and capable but I can only report what Ive experienced So far so great,positive
These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb Still a great guitar string A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of 34Goretex34 A real triumph of reinvention Well done Goretex Warmer Guitar Strings A must have for guitarists,positive
I purchased these for my little pedal board The stepping stoneTHese are very well made with the heads well secured The plastic is thick and of a nice materialThe cables come with a massive 5 year warranty so Im sure theyre not going bad anytime soonBuy with confidence Great quality,positive
Did a ton of research out there b4 I bought this I cant BELIEVE that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal What a racket it is If I could make one I would This one was cheap and does the job Dunzos best bang for your buck,positive
Pros Its a good tuner its a good metronome and its a great combination package The flipout stand on the back makes it easier to see than when its lying flat The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to programCons the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas and its too easy to accidentally turn the unit on The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest Also unlike the CA30 tuner this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environmentAlso it quit working suddenly after about a year Other people I know whove had this tuner have complained about lack of durability Good for a single package but there are better,neutral
when it works good its great but sometimes it gets staticy I wish it had a volume in line not much more to say Nice pick up,positive
Its solid Has great quality doesnt short out on you I had it for a few months now not a tear anywhere in site Planet Waves printed on the cord guaranteed for life i think they mean it XD No BS,positive
All I can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for While this isnt the new break through tech or the rave of the much much higher end mics it does deliver With a decent mixer you can get a very nice response Been giggin since the early 70s and have been hosting an openmic to boot I get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice super affordable microphone its a charm b B Worth five times the price,positive
These dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as I am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the Behringer MS16 which I was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or XLR connection point require AC power for both and as P Frary has stated are VERY dependent on input they kind of worked with my Stanton S300 and not at all with my laptopThey are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to Because of the dual amps you dont hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unitI actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded greatFor your normal Stereo mini jack and RCA hook ups I would go with the much lower priced MS16s which have multiple RCA jack in points and one Stereo mini and full front controlsAddendum 1013I finally hit a home run with these speaker when I hooked them up to Sony CD changer unit I have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one onoff switch The soundis full and fills the room Love them finally,positive
Pretty sweet guitar for the price Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul I really like the vintage sunburst color Its more orange than what the picture shows The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference Overall sounds and looks awesome Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul Freakin Sick,positive
Works well for my guitar It holds where I left it over a year ago I dont use it all that often though Black strap,positive
Tis pedal really did for me what I wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt Hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines I dont mess with the noise gate so I cant really comment on that but everything else is first rate smoking hot,positive
Sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever Usually I wouldnt notice a significant difference between brands except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears but when I put Daddarios on my 000 I just couldnt believe the improvement over the Martins It took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear These consistently sound the most balanced and responsive With the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything elseIm glad the search is over for awhile and I have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here There is no other for now,positive
This strap is not a bad one but it just did not fit my guitar so that is the only problem I have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it Good strap doesnt work for my guitar,neutral
I use this guy with a Fender Twin since Overdrive sound is not enough for now a days metal Not much of noise and practical carry If you really want to go for something a bit more 34Marshall JCM900 like34 get a MXR Custom Badass 78 Distortion For a extreme get a Riot A No1 Classic,positive
SUPER usb mic I use this when I broadcast from streetjellycom I set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal JUST make sure you have ALL your mic levels set to NOT CLIP and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic SUPER USB MIC,positive
I have been a faithful user of DAddario strings since a well meaning obsessionstarter recommended them to me at a local music store Compared to other brands of nickel strings that Ive used these ones just feel cleaner than the others They have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than mostIf youre looking for acoustic strings you cant beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity But if youre looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean look no further Pretty good for an electric,positive
This pickguard was used It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before I payed for a new pickguard but got a used one,negative
There are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well Before this I had been using tuner pro android app that also works well but I dont have it all the timeThere is one big negative it is absolutely useless outside in the sun or even shade Cant even tell if it is on or off Outside of that I am glad I picked the red version instead of the others Good value,positive
I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it What I like about this one is how the release lever works On the Cannon the lever was vertical This made actuating it a less natural motion With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with itAside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well Good design and well made,positive
They are cheap and look good They also have a nice full sound and are holding up well Highly recommended Great strings,positive

Product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller This unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies the 15 dB pull in each direction for each of the seven bands are filter worthy My only dissatisfaction lies in the amount of noise this unit adds to my chain when engaged When inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage When this unit is engaged each frequency band carves the sounds nicely however consideration to have this unit modified to reduce its noisy output has begun for me at least I am thankful for the internet and the opportunities it presents for me to MOD this Pedal Used GE7,positive
At the begining I wasnt sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine I also realized that pedals positions routing signal has something to do with it I couldnt figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it so it work as it is supposed to Nice adapter,positive

As the reviews herein have indicated there is a wide variety of uses for studio monitor like the MAudio BX5 With the proper cables you can hook up everything from an iPad to a home computer to a musical instrument or stereo I will preface this review by saying that I am no 34audiophile34 I have a basic understanding of speaker and musical equipment but my primary goal here was to find a small speaker that I could use to monitor guitar playing through either a preamp pedal or iPad modeling softwareWith those goals in mind I was pleasantly surprised how good the BX5 sounded The goal of any 34studio monitor34 is to convey as much of the true sound of the source material as possible without coloring the tone with additional equalization There are some monitors in a comparable price range like the Rokkit 5 and options from Mackie and JBL I have not tried those out But the BX5 performs we well or better than I hopedFor guitar playing I use it in close proximity on a desktop I found that it had a surprising amount of low end punch for a 534 woofer given that my Fender tube amp has a speaker twice the size The bass is tight and articulate which is what you want Again if your goal is just to drown out the sound with additional base go get a pair of Beats headphones or hook up a dozen subwoofers to it That wasnt really my goal But all that aside having enough low end was important to me and the BX5 delivers Using modeling of 34Fender34 and 34Vox34 type amplifiers it also handled the high end 34chime34 well without sounding 34tinny34I should note that I got an XLR microphone cable that converts to TRS on the other side I had heardread that this was the best way to get a guitar signal into the thing though there are likely adapters and other cables you could use to accomplish the same thing There are both XLR and TRS inputs on the back The monitor is powered so theres a power cable as well There is a volume knob but no independent basstreble adjustment as on other monitors So if you want that look elsewhere but if the monitor is actually relaying most of source tone you shouldnt be using it anyway Really enjoying my BX5 so far wish I had the budgetspace for a 2nd one Outstanding monitor for guitar playingrecording,positive
About 4 years ago one of my friend dropped his bass and its body broke in half that bass had regualr strap button ever since then he use this dunlop straplok system i recently built a bass myself and i install this one its very easy to install very straight forward to use it it holds my jazz bass without any problem i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars Rock solid straplok system,positive
The Ernie Ball Super Slinky String Set 9 42 are a great set of string to replace my old string with on my guitar They feel and sound great when you play them Highly recommend these strings Ernie Ball Super Slinky String Set 9 42,positive
For years I used Kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue Planet Waves NS has a smoother handle that doesnt stick out as much and ive had no issues with gripping it on or off so far It is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly If youre looking to buy a capo id recommend this over a Kyser Sturdy and easy to handle capo,positive
Ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use no problem with the pedal itself mechanically However the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product That is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time If you mount it on a pedal board you will probably remove those feet and this wont be a problem Also the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable at least on my unit the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in otherwaise ZAP Other than those two issues the power issue really no fault of Dunlops if you use the supplied power cable its been a great pedal A classic that will surely live on The legend lives on,positive
These guys are rocksolid and really easy to install Any time I get a new instrument I change the stock buttons out for Dunlops The best straplocks available,positive
IT DOES THE JOB It is nice and it fits well on my desktop mic stand and it looks nice infront of my Shockmount that holds my Audio Technica AT2020 Great cheap pop filter,positive

not the greatest little pick up for the price im more than happy with its performance put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny I wont fit in the sound hole to I clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well Cant beat it for the price I use it for My Uke,positive
I chose this because I wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings So far it has worked beautifully String Cleaber is great,positive

Cheap works great for playing and foot controllers Will not handle bulk dumps so I have to use a different interface for programming and backups Good for what it is no MIDI dumps,positive
Ive used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments theyre fairly inexpensive and Ive never had a problem with them never broke one nor had to replace them because of wearabuse and Ive NEVER had a guitarbass hit the floor A couple of warnings here which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks 1 you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole some people put a matchstick toothpick piece of paper or SOMETHING inside the hole to tighten it up if the holes too big or has been stripped out I use a touch of Elmers Glue screw in the straplock and let it sit for a day 2 You have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesnt work itself off the end use a socket to get the nut really tight New straps seem to be easier to secure Work well with caveats,positive
Ok this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems Cons Minor one would be that when mounted the face of the tuner doesnt exactly face your eyes you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you But the biggest CON is its pretty much worthless at a bright daylight gig In sunlight its TOO dim ha ha At home or at a night gig its fine Daylight Forget it Everything about this is good EXCEPT,positive
This product does what it is designed to do very very well It is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully This product does what it is designed to do very very well,positive
There is no doubt about it National fingerpicks are pretty much the standard The metal fingerpicks are rock solid sturdygauge steel The plastic thumbpicks match tone very well And note that unlike what you may read in another review they are adjustable You just need to heat them up in some hot water and bend to fit On my resonator these provide a full loud sound The only reasons that for me these dont rate 5 stars are that 1 the ProPick F Tone fingerpicks I usually use provide much more of a sense of feel and 2 the National fingerpicks have a tendency to be a little noisier than the ProPicks on the guitars unwound strings Even though I like the National metal fingerpicks much better than plastic fingerpicks Ive used and even though they produce more fullness than the ProPicks for me the sense of feel that I get from the openfinger design of the ProPicks trumps volume This is important to keep in mind for players whose only fingerpicking experience is with fingers alone Players who are already used to metal or plastic fingerpicks should give the National picks strong consideration They are solid sound great and this packaging of them is excellent By the way the bonus pick is cute and will go in my logo pick collection but its a very thin gauge to be useful to me on anything other than electric guitar Great Picks But There May Be Better Options for Some Players,positive
I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid Stiffer and brighter than Tortex,positive
This is a heavy duty strap I use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesnt fall It is a very comfy strap and prolly wouldnt break if you had a knife to it Its the best strap money can buy The best,positive
I figured I would splurge and buy these just to have some backup cables when I wear out the cheap guitar center ones and have some that match They are well built and feel like they can take some abuse I will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables Great quality,positive
I bought this for an accousic guitar then I had to have one for a mandolin and now I also have one for a squareneck dobro Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar dont leave much room for a leather strap Some case manufacturers have the same problem This item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job Same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap The dobro had the issue with the strap didnt have a great connector Great help,positive
tennessee saxefun to use not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon Still seems to be good qualityOf course Hohner has been around longer than me Tennessee saxe,positive
Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack Speaker is acceptable quality but cant be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 1020 watts Im opting for the convenience of the size I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects I like the brit setting I sound like a rock star with it Good product for practice or recording You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp This product works for me and the quality is pretty good Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this Nice portable amplifier for practice,positive
My friend has commented on its bright color youll never lose that thing I hope hes right cause I love this little tuner Works well and easier to read than many of its competitors nice tuner for the,positive
I love the open feel from these picks Its almost like picking with with just your fingers except with more volume Great Approach,positive
This item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars I tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady The locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position The short extension in the picture is not on the unit I received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered I would purchase this unit again and again It is a good piece and a good deal Just what The doctor ordered,positive
I am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables I have used them with my bands PA system and they work nicely I would and do recommend them to anyone looking for quality at an affordable price GLS 3 ft audio xlr cables,positive
I recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal It is super sturdy transparent and I fully expect to have this for a very long time The tuner out is a nice feature but the serious selling point is the quality Go no further for your volume pedal needs The Standard,positive
This small device has amazing quality The builtin mic records very well compared to those tiny handheld monorecorders Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise like reviews state but when used on lowgain record quite well AudioIN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer I used a Behringer U802 for AMAZINGLY clear recordings Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device Even NiMH 12V batteries can power this although alkaline 15V last longerCON The plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully Small yet Powerful,positive
I bought an extension for it and so this plug has allowed me to stop using eight batteries Hard not to like that This is a handy piece of equipment,positive
These locks are the only ones I use now they are on all of my guitars and I put them on all I build I have not had a guitar drop since I started using them and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached I have tried the Fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my Schaller equipped straps will not fit them I will stick with the Schaller in all 3 colors Schaller Security Strap Locks,positive
Works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb Good pedal for the price,positive
Not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive No assembly instructions were included in the packaging Ive never owned something like this before so that was annoying Luckily some nice pictures were posted on the web page and I was able to figure it out from there Once I got it put together and placed my beloved guitar in the thing I got happier It looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish Id recommend this stand to others but be aware of shipping tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions Not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still Nice stand eventually,neutral

This was exactly what I needed and worked out great It would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons I had to pay another dollar at my local guitar shop for the felt padded washers Great Product,positive
I dont have any problems with this pedal but for the price I would just go with the Way Huge Aqua Puss for an analog delay Good pedal,neutral
This is a great tuner High quality construction The tuning is accurate The controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously The Fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing Great tuner,positive
Ive done a good bit of recording over the years This microphone has very very low self noise low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable patternIve listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options This mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail but without hype or over brightnessI applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this more expensive functional competition Variable pattern low noise,positive
This Jim Dunlop 210 Dunlop Bottleneck Slide is basically a glass tube and so far seems pretty durable I will not get it to describing this specific product in detail because well its just a tube I think I already mentioned something about it being sturdyA bottleneck slide is always nice to have one to replicate someone elses guitar sound or create your own Whether you get brass or glass is your preference Yes they do have different tonal qualities so you may want to try or buy bothHappy playing CheersJ Nice to have just make sure you size it right,positive
Extremely easy to use tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly Have used it several times and first battery still has juice Excellent tuner,positive
I love BOSS pedals I owned a DS1 Distortion and a MT2 Metal Zone for years and loved them both This one is a good meet in the middle of those two Its great if you want some really good bluesy distortion or you can crank the color and get some thick distortionAs always this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy I love it a great pedal,positive
Works very well and is almost hidden on the guitar it is one of those things that once you have it the other ones that stick out seem poorly designed This one will stay on my guitar the others I always took off once it tune as they look so awkward Fits on Strat very sleek and almost hidden tunes like a champ plus metronome,positive
I already had the nickel finished version which I paid a few dollars more forand wanted a spare I like the Dunlop design and price It should last a lifetimeGlad I got it This one is finished nicer than the nickel finish one I have which is rough looking in comparisonThe black Dunlop has a nice smooth finish Nice,positive
Ever since I started playing the guitar Ive used the nylon Dunlop picks Theyre better in a thicker size 10mm or larger but the 73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick Theyre flexible and easy to pick with but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break Youd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it so one pack of them will last you yeeeeearsAlso of note the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason dont pay more than 34 for a pack of them as you can get them at your local music store for about that Good picks,positive
I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe Nice padding nice features Very Nice,positive
I bought my son a thousand dollar Epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for Christmas I told him an expensive one was not in our budgetWe went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one The sound was absolutely fabulous much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this oneThe store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well In my opinion this was as good as other brands costing three times as much Im not sure how Takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money but if youre looking for a starter guitar or just looking to add another guitar to your collection this would make an excellent choiceI inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this priceWe also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs theJasmine by Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar Natural Excellent sound and quality as good as others costing much more,positive
this pedal i tried it out thru a silver face fender twinwow it cranksit really will produce marshall plexi tonesespecially noticeable in the lower registerson the E and A stringsif you want a marshall stack sound this is itif you wanty a variety i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions so you can chose any amp sound you needreally people for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys makeand they all are super real deal,positive

This versatile tool does what it says it does Pretty good quality But after purchasing I realized that a tool like this isnt too necessary Some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks But it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient Does its Job,positive
these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound goodthey are almost as good sounding as monster cables but just a little bit worse i actually dont use monster cables anymore i like this one more and for the price how can i complaina tip for people new to guitar cable that have a angled jack are best for when you sit and play because when you plug a straight one into the guitar jack and you sit you actually bend the wire and what happens is the wire actually have to be bent in a certain way to work and eventually wont work at alljust like headphone wiresbut when you plugged the angled one into the guitar its all good and no problems CheapDurableand sounds nice,positive
This is an A pedalIts small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectlyThe MXR Micro Flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesIf you want a Flanger to do any more than that youre just goofing off mostly I need a subtle wash for flanger work and the MXR Micro is perfect for that Exactly what I needed,positive
I have countless delay pedals and racks This inexpensive delay is very special It has the tone and mojo of an analog delay It wont give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for It sounds great clean or dirty its a relatively short delay which is great for many genres Long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal Eric Johnson like music I would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment Its bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music Pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and youll be near the dark side of the moon Many musicians use two delay pedals I know I often do This one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage Both work together to help me find the tones that I am searching for The unit itself seems sturdy and well made I use carbon zinc batteries in mine They just seem to sound better to my ears Keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long timeTrue bypass and no hiss Great surprise as I never took Rogue seriously Never thought itd be my goto pedal Amazing analog sound that richly colors your tone,positive
Im so glad I bought this instead of some of the cheaper plastic pedalboards out there The board itself is made out of welded metal and its very sturdy The velcro seems to be of decent quality too Even the bag is niceThe single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag As other reviewers have pointed out the fact that it clips onto the bag in weird places basically makes it worthless My advice is to a definitely buy the pedal train mini and b toss the shoulder strap in a drawer somewhere and never look at it againIm using this unit for my bass gear a SansAmp programmable bass driver DI a compressor a tunerand possibly an envelope filter at some point almost perfect,positive
This is another useful item from Planet Waves for the guitar player This winder saves timeespecially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every stringThis is not bulky fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room Worth the price Planet Waves,positive

These tuners just seem OK to me I still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner The accuracy in my opinion just isnt there Still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing The price is right OK,neutral
I bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio It does what it is supposed to Im no master of compression but I get a very usable controlled signal from it I noticed some hum when I turned the level up pretty high and that should be expected I paid less than 30 for this pedal and that should be a factor when youre considering durability of this pedalMy bass player uses this pedal going into an SVT classic No noticeable hum at 34concert34 levelYes this pedal is made of high strength plastic If you are an angry stomper go elsewhere This pedal will not survive your overzealous footBattery changing Yes its a pain in the butt Two pens are required to push in the hinge pins to release the battery cover the footswitch itself I bought a power supply never looked backSo if you are on a budget or NOT one of the lucky ones with an endorsement deal with a boutique pedal co This should do well for you Plastic fantastic,positive
This strap seemed a little awkward at first but after a rigorous six month evaluation its become my goto strapI currently have it locked to a Fender Strat and experience NO problems with the strap ends rubbing against the body of the guitar Although the strap ends are light plastic theyve held up well The nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear The nylon isnt that soft so if you are that guy who insists on playing shirtless then this may not be the strap for youIt will lock to most standard strap ends if the body of your guitar allows it I wasnt all that happy with this strap connected to a Les Paul Great strap if it fits your guitar,positive

If youre not using a pedal board these are just what you need Good priceGood quality I use them for the times that a short patch cord is better then tripping over longer cables I use them to patchin additional effects outside of my pedal board and theyre perfect for patching my amp head to a slave head BUT If youre building a pedal board AMAZON sells solid double male connecters Digitech PC2 Hardwire Accessory Premium Gold Plated 14 Male Coupler that work great and really cleanup your pedal board Very handy,positive

As far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion Compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard However if used as a fuzz pedal instead it truly shines since this is really what it is Does it have distortion Yes Is it valuable as such Not in my opinion It isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply Not so with this pedal You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries which sux IMO especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chainAnyways while this is fun to play with you should definitely consider the sound you are going for If you prefer to play a more grungy or 70s era metal then this will work for you For more crisp sound you should look elsewhere IMO Pretty average distortion great fuzz,neutral
When you need a nononsense leather strap that is not long consider this If you need something fancy or want to sling your guitar low or if you are a tall person probably you want to skip thisIm 5ft 8 and Im already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin and its not like Im trying to hold my guitar particularly low If you are a tall person or if you want to mimic Jimmy Pages posture or something this is not for youApart from that I have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive its more so if I believe the made in Canada sticker on it Hard to beat it as far as leather straps go At 25 inches wide its comfortable oneply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough and the looks of it is not that bad either Sure there should be nicerbetter product but you cannot buy them for 12 bucksThe only complaint I have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap Though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some elbow grease it would have been nice if I was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar Very good costperformance ratio as far as leather straps go,positive
Quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any Ernie Ball productsgreat very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces I have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use Ernie Ball Quality,positive
Meh these things are what they are They didnt solve any problems or make anything better Oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason Maybe what you really need is a new set of strings,neutral
I have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but I hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers It really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound This pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts This pedal has three preamp settings Ts9 Hot and Turbo Its great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar One nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings For example if you set on the Turbo setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely If you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound If you want a metal sound then I recommend the Metal Zone by BossRolandBOSS MT2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal Warm and Tube like sound,positive
This stand does its job quite well The only problem I can foresee anyone having is there are no instructions on the proper way to unfold it Its not a difficult problem to solve though so be patient and all will work out UpdateI just want to add that the seller of this item went above and beyond as far as customer service I have nothing but praise for them A nice stand,positive
I love these straps I have them installed on all of my guitars After a Dunlop lock failure I decided to change over Our bands drummer and guitarist both used and recommened these straps so I gave them a chance They are amazing much more comfortable then one of those bulky heavy leather straps and just as strong I was worried that the plastic clips wouldnt hold up but they do I feel 100 secure that my guitar will not fall They look good as well and they are easily adjustable My transmitter pack slid on with ease and I was ready to go A lot of bands I have seen on the road use these strapsI didnt rate these straps 5 stars however because of a few reasons1 I play heavy guitars I was concerned about the screws that came with the straps For a standard lightweight guitar they may be fine but for say a Gibson or my Agile Intrepid Pro I wanted more security I took a slighty wider and longer screw than provided covered it and filled the install hole with epoxy and drilled it in It holds incredible its NOT coming out now for sure2 I use the black white and blue colors They discolor very easily Through sweat dirt and cigarette smoke they eventually start to look nasty I would suggest going with the black for this reason3 I put my confidence in these straps 100 but I wouldnt start doing guitar swings with them Its just a plastic clip and anything can fail Ive seen guys electricalduct tape the clips for extra support and theyve all been able to get away with swinging their guitars around but personally I choose to play it safe as I lost my best guitar to a failed straplock during a spinAll DiMarzio products are incredible If you want something light and comfy that looks sleek and will keep your guitar protected I highly suggest these straps My strap of choice,positive
This pedal does add reverb and it is adjustable to different effects but the range of effects is not great and the difference in them is often not very pronounced Its kind of an 34empty34 sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects The Reverb Machine RV600 also from Behringer and for only 10 more is a FAR superior machine with more effects and better tone though it has a couple of other minor drawbacks See my review of that item for clarification Medium results,neutral
No messing around fits well in bass tuner knobs spins well and the cutter is good this is the one to get Nice,positive

Basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion I have big hands which may be part of it These are my favorites,positive
This little box is great for metronome use It is loud and the screen is easy to see The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid I would buy another one if I lost this one Good for the money,positive
I have had several MXR pedals through the years I have always found their quality to be very good for the price in fact some of their pedals exceed the competitors products for less than half the price to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesnt mean it is that much betterIf you need a little tone sweetener this pedal can deliver with flatter EQs it is fairly noiseless but as with all EQs if you boost certain frequencies pretty high you will get some noise Simple to use and I particularly like the lighted LEDs for each band this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage As with all MXR pedals it is built solid and roadrugged For the price this is a nice pedal simple to use and built to last A Good Basic EQ Pedal,positive
Just got this It is my first pedal of any sort It has many tones and a library of other settings I can play with I just plug in my headphones and I am off in my own world when I play I can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever I want or at least get close to what I want I see myself using this for a good while before I need to upgrade This also came with an AC adapter even though the box said it didnt Pretty Nice,positive
These are perfect but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed I would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package I have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which dont match they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced These are perfect,positive
I went a long time convincing myself that I didnt need these I had numerous times when my strap would come undone fortunately never during a performance These solved the problem I still check but they just wont pull out or release Guitar strap locks a must have,positive
A great deal here on Amazon these cost a lot more a few years ago it appears Chief bought Raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing The shelf I received has slots all over it instead of a bunch of screw holes this makes it really easy to mount things Im ordering more of these they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgetsGood luck and good music to all A very good single space rack shelf,positive
Bought this distortion pedal for our sonwho plays his electric guitar daily He loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use It also produces a nice 34distorted34 sound quality and tone I dont know if I would agree as my generation hails from a different genre of music But he loves it and I guess thats all that matters Great Distortion Pedal,positive
Am totally pleased that I did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it Works greatget one step connection,positive
but it works fine for meI used to connect a Orange Micro Terror Head AmpOrange Amplifiers Micro Terror MT20 20W Hybrid Guitar Amp Head Standardto a cabinet PPC108Orange PPC108 1x8 Speaker Cabinet maybe a little pricy,positive
Fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks It is quite tight on my picks but I imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used There when you need it,positive
I want to like this more but its not as good as my other tuners Tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not As easy as the little round ones from Snark I like those better and theyre cheaper Not great,neutral
Ive had this for almost a year While Im no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes I havent used a compressor pedal since Washburn made that really janky noisy compressor pedal in the late 80s I have never used a Ross so the fact that this is supposedly a clone didnt have any influence over my decision to buy the Joyo I will say that its not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it Sure I love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do but compression takes time to dial in even if you are familiar with it That said I finally love this pedal and feel that I can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrivedistortion I bought it mainly because I play in a Rush cover band and the harmonics at the beginning and end of Red Barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until I got the Joyo dialed in Compression isnt the easiest effect to dial in but once youre there you can pretty much leave it set as long as youre using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars Great pedal once you get it dialed in Take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as I am Like,positive
Great all round pick one of my favorites Easy to grip and are pretty quite They wear out extremely fast though Great all round pick,positive
A great deal on what I consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there Do the big names in the music biz use Ernie Ball strings Yes and for good reason While it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety I have found that for my USA Stratocaster that the ease of play with the 34934 strings is the clincher and they provide an amazingly full sound with no stress on the fingers at all My favorite strings for life,positive
Ive been playing guitar for years and lately Ive been wanting some slinkier strings so I can get a little more bend out of them I thought Id try these out and I loved them After playing with these for a week I loved the way that they played and I loved the way they sound So I ordered 6 more packs of these The extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely wont find a better set of strings for the money My new favorite guitar strings,positive
Ive been a Fender player since I first picked up the guitar Ive used different strings from DDarrio to Ernie Ball and now I always use Fender strings For Stratocasters I always use Super Bullets and for Telecasters I use Super 250s The only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the 250s The bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a Strat I dont use the tremolo very much so I dont know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super 250s I figure I might as well get the ones that are designed for the Strat Also these are the OEM strings that Fender installs at the factory so you cant go wrong with that I highly recommend them My favorite strings,positive
I would say this stand is for the occasional user who doesnt put more weight than a few sheets of paper on itThe top part is not secured It just slides on the tip of the tripod Pick it up and carry it around itll come apart and scratch your StradivariusThe foot is horrible It sort of hooks in place with a little clamp That means you get ONE position And that one doesnt look like it will live very longComes in a pouch which helps to put it awaySpend more if you can Its okay Really just okay,neutral
I own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there Ive only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so I use a lot of these guys and if they work when you get them they havnt failed yet hosa rocks,positive
Works great and does a good job a must have type tool for the price get one Light takes up little space and easy to use Great Tool,positive
not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string I break high e strings on occasion but something as thick as an A string maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them Further more do I stick with the same brand that is supposed to last longer than average strings At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinkysupdate 325well another month went bya week ago and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be either way its losing another star if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitarreview and change accordingly they sound a lot brighter,negative
the snark tuner is theBEST one I have owned extremely accurate easy to use very reasonably priced for such a good piecehave paid lots more for products that were harder and not as accurate the best tuner yet,positive
Item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar Holds my strap well I am happy I bought this NIce Product,positive
Ive been wanting a pitch vibrato pedal for a while but didnt want to spend 350500 for an old boss vb2which this pedal sounds exactly like so i looked at this which I didnt really know what to expect but when I got it I was amazed by it it sounds really good It maybe less durable than a metal pedal but who cares for this price I wouldnt mind buying a new one if mine broke and considering there is hardly any companies that actually make pitch vibratosunivibeVibe pedals are not pitch vibrato pedalsbuying a new one isnt a problem awesome,positive
I have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetishcom which works well The Snark is a bit larger only an issue really if you dont like having something clipped to your headstock but its much easier to read and its very sensitive and accurate according to my ear anyway Easy to use picks up the note very quickly and the colored visual indicators are so easy to see even in bright light which can be an issue with my other oneAlso someone made this point in another review this thing can be a great training tool to learn the notes all over the neck It picks up the note very quickly and so it can be used very easily for that purpose as well Wow Great tuner,positive
Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy I know Im gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also Look forward to getting those crappy loose unsmooth original hardware tuners off this thingJuly 20 2012Just installed these Fender locking tuners on my Strat Didnt have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size Placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them and very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points Then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch I made a center punch mark just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft on each indent that the tuner made Set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than 15 minutes These and a Fender LSR roller nut did wonders I floated my tremolo again,positive
Ive been using these strings for about eight years and I also use them on my two Taylors 814CE I use the mediums on my 710 I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there I still use Martin strings once in awhile but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on themActually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylors and right now theyre all strung with EXPs I know people want different sounds from their strings but I find these to be bright with a great bottom on them unlike the Elixirs which I find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end These strings sound great with great dynamics on them Even on my Laguna Grand Symphony slightly larger than a Grand Concert they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs These on my Grand Auditorium do the same thing they produce the sound I demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings Ive usedThe Mediums on my 710 have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mids and trebleAs I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings once in awhile but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great Darn near as near to an uncoated string that youre going to find Great sounding set of coated strings,positive
Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out or were missing all together When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects this is a major concern It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products Poor quality control,negative
The quality of it is above my expectations The only thing I wouldve like different is the accessory box inside They couldve make it a little bigger The box already fell down 4 times I got small kids and nothing happened to it or the guitar Great product worth every penny Best for the money,positive
True meaning of the US Dreamit is hard with a soft overtone giving a sense of calm and well being wow yes that is it no more to be written joy o the american dream Joy O the US DREAM,positive
Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging I just didnt want to spend 100 on the Boss version but you get what you pay for Another thing that I hate is its really hard to change the battery unlike the Boss pedals save your money and steer clear of this one I also bought a Behringer power amp for 200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out review of Behringer EQ 700 pedal,negative
I am learning to play the guitar I needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound I debated between this one and the other popularslightly more expensive one I cannot speak to that ones assembly process but I found this one to be reasonably simpleI also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raiselower it The same goes for tilting It is a superb stand with ample table space for book iPad capo some picks and if you are creative headphones I love it and I am using it almost every single day Very solid construction and the stand with the most height I could findGo ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered As of today this is the one that wins in the height shelf and space categories Biggest table shelf and highest stand I could find no more having to bend over to read my book,positive
Bought for project Telecaster Delivered promptly and in excellent shape Case fits well and is finished nice Hard to find better case at this low price Telecaster case,positive
Comfortable and very nice fabric love it looks awesome with my white jackson and u can also adjust it to your body Great fabric,positive
Im a professional musician playing 68 times a month This pedal does far more than I need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles I really like the 38 second looping functionthats plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative Dont forget to order the external power supply I would have happily paid a little extra money to have it includednot sure why its not Double A batteries last a longer time than I expected they would I havent had a chance to play with customizing patches etc but Im sure that Ill be pleased with what it has to offer Awesome Pedal,positive
I bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy I would think it would work even better with a mic Good stand,positive
Im a beginner harmonica player and this was perfect for me I am able to practice with it easily and it didnt cost me a fortune as some of the more professional harmonicas are Good sound,positive
Ive had it for about a month now and it hasnt fallen apart so I guess thats a plus but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE Its definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this Not a good product flawed production,negative
Great quality and construction Does its job well Only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline These bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy Overall stays in place and does its job well A workhorse for sure Does the job well,positive
Replaced a stock fender speaker in a modified Mustang Lead II cabinet that I now use connected to a Hughes and Kettner amp This speaker dramatically improved the sound of the cabinet and sounded good using the Mustang II amp as well This speaker seems to take some of the sizzle and shrill off the highend to make a nice even sound Im quite pleased with this speaker Awesome,positive
Im an Irishstyle DADGAD guitarist These picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms Im starting to lean towards the Tortex 5mm though I think the roughness on the surface of the Dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that I dont like Still great picks Great for rhythm guitar,positive
I bought this for a friend whos previous tuner was lost I have to say Ive been so impressed by how easy this is to read that Ill probably buy one for myself nowOther than a great display and accurate tuning this is made with a moveable arm between the tuner and the clip The arm is a dual ball joint and allows you to configure this is any position youd likeI wasnt expecting it to be this nice Very cool Very Easy To UseSee,positive
This clip does the same thing that the Hercules guitar stands do Lock your guitar in place so you dont have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger The autoclose function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger Simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime Its a Hercules ClipEnough Said,positive
I was still searching for a pick to replace the ones I left somewhere I knew these were not the ones I sought but they are great They dont move around in my hand I have yet to drop one and for the first time I noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar These sound great Ive found a new favorite pick Sound is great and havent dropped one yet,positive
I just got them I bought 5 and put them up so I dont know about longevity So far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough And the price is greatI am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar classical acoustic guitar electric guitar electric bass guitar 4 string and mandolin The hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability Sweet and Simple Great Price,positive
Very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass If you dont have a pedal board with a tuner this is invaluable to quickly tune up Small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case Good accuracy compared to my Korg pitchblack Handy and precise,positive
Only had it a few days but is working great and I like that it is true bypass Price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on The default tuning display is perfect for me as Ive not been real impressed with some of the other top tuners out there IMO you cant go wrong with this tuner very pleased Outstanding Tuner,positive
Ive bought 4 of these over the past couple of years I wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that I could use one handed It gives me piece of mind that somone wont just brush up against a guitar and damage it Ive noticed that it has been backordered on several sites so I expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too Just what I needed,positive
it sounds great nice and warm and lush one of the better trems ive had the pleasure to use however i hate the plastic housing and how the inputoutput jacks are located I dont have heavy feet so it will probably last a good long while on my board but i really wouldnt want to put too much weight on it sounds great,positive
Its a flange pedal what else For the price I was really happy with it If I knew someone who was more skilled than me Id get the workings inside a different case The shape is cool but Id feel safer with it in a metal casing The button is smaller than I thought but its not an issue at all its kinda easier to pressAs for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm I would recommend this Great for the price,positive
Exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope Hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though Design looks great in the light too Hard to get this wrong,positive
It was my fault not to check out its measurements before purchase But its not the reason why I drop by one star The reason is its not designed properlySince people stand and sing this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than 6 feet Im 511 I can barely reach the microphone when I stand stillAlso its way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a PC micAs a result I feel Im either too tall or too shortBuild quality is fine and its price can not get beaten Overall a four stars product IMO Not tall enough Not short enough,positive
I play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isnt one of them But after seeing so many great uke players lately Jake Shimaukuro Joe Brown I had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself I wanted a playable instrument and I didnt feel like spending a lot of money Ive tried 3040 ukes in stores that were big disappointments bad intonation no tone etc After reading reviews here and elsewhere I decided to risk a purchaseResult This is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks Sure it doesnt have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top but it delivers good tone excellent intonation and good playability at a very good price It may not be a 5star intrument but its a 5star valueIf youre thinking about trying ukulele but youre not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away I would strongly recommend an LU21 Even after you buy a better uke this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests so that you can play ukulele duets Surprisingly good,positive
These sticks are solid hickory which is insanely durable and sounds great for classic rock and punk rock drums These sticks are weight and sound matched so each pair will sound and feel almost identical I love these sticks,positive
If you havent used these picks get some They are the perfect size and shape Your really cant beat them Great Picks,positive
As I am one of those forever beginners when it comes to playing a guitar I may not be able to tell you all that this capo does The reason I ordered it is to hold my strings so I can set my guitar I may play around with it to see what all it doesGood price just as described Just as described and good price,positive
These are a little course for what I wanted Brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking They may be giving the strings a little premature wear and the loss of tonality is the problem There are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm Steely,neutral
I should have researched this a little bit more It was a gift for a child but a child couldnt tune this thing nor could I It was a toy not an instrument This is a toynot a real instrument,neutral
I expected this Shure SM57 knockoff to disappoint me I was not For 30 bucks this thing does the job There is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about I put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise I recommend this mic for vocals Ive had fun with it As far as longevity and durability time will tell Surprised,positive
This was a great strap i used it on my guitar for months and its so strong that its tough to take off im buying another one for my bass super strong strap,positive
When I attached it to my guitars I said 34Wow this beats its more expensive competition Does it hold Yes Does it damage your instrument No Im going to get another one before they decide to raise the price Wow This Beats Its More Expensive Competiton,positive
Ive used Elixirs for about five years now This set offers the same great sound for my acoustic as their electric strings provide for my electric Some people dont like the polymer nanoweb that coats the string but I find that it cuts back on string noise Sliding your fingers around doesnt cause too much noise and with acoustic strings I find that very important especially if youre using a piezo pickup in your instrument Phosphor Bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars IMHO These are great strings worth the money and sound great They also last 3 times longer than regular noncoated strings in my experience been playing for 24yrs Great product Elixirs just sound good,positive
Im not a performing musician so I actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand Holds everything from a 5mm nylon pick to a 31mm rubber pick and I have yet to see one fall out Simple solution to a simple problem Easy to keep track of my picks,positive
This keyboard is pretty dope I bought this a while back when I bought my Samson 49 key midi keyboard Its been a little over 2 years and Ive used it ever since I recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently You cant go wrong with this stand Very solid keyboard stand for the price,positive
Works like its supposed to Although I should have just got the universal instrument tuner This one only tunes in the uke keys Great,positive
Realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitarI have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well very nice cable,positive
What can you say at less than 30incl shipping its a steal I was looking for a VERY inexpensive version of the popular Sansamp and this does it for me Decent SVT flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet DI I go DI to the house and the output into my old Seymour Duncan ampAguilar GS410 cab Great tone Im using a 9VDC Class II wall wart found it in my spare parts closet vs 9V batteries With the wall wart no DI hum Great Does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply Never use the foot switch if used at all I use my finger If broken or lostwho would steal it Id buy another in a heart beat Best bass effect for 29 and change,positive
I opted to use the EH for its different tonal characteristics but sometimes I still switch this one in Its a good quality great sounding tube The JJ seems to be slightly more even in tone and a little bit better sustain in the low mids if thats what you prefer Good powerful,positive
This is more of a like it or hate kind of item If it doesnt work you hate it If it works theres nothing impressive about a stand so I just like it Does what its suposed to,positive
I got this to power my Danelectro Honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy Its a power adaptor so it isnt too exciting but it works fine It works,positive
These drops are not just a convenience In my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists If you are reading this wondering if you should consider buying this product to stop your tuning pegs from slipping or to make them turn smoother and in less dramatic tuning jumps the answer is yes Buy this it does work and it works very wellEven though the instructions said to put a drop on two different places on each peg I wanted to go light just in case so at first I only put 1 drop on each peg I didnt know what to expect and you can always put more on but too much could be a bad thing Also each instrument is different each peg is different I had one very stubborn peg while the others were just the normal level of obnoxious about slipping You may only need 1 drop on some pegs and the reccomended 2 drops on the others I had new strings on which of course are going to take forever to stretch out and will need constant tuning I did not remove the strings I just loosened the pegs a little and pulled them out a tiny bit one at a time then put the first drop on the spot where the peg would make contact when put back in on the tuning head side of the peg the part you actually turn I put the 2nd small drop on the dead end of the peg not the end you turn Be careful when applying that you dont get more than 1 small drop at a time This stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way One bottle should last you a very long timeWhat to expect With one drop the effect is immediate You will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better After playing for awhile I decided to put a 2nd drop on each peg as suggested by the included instruction sheet This helped them all to stay in place even better than before The pegs now also turn smoother and easier and I can tune much easier than before in smaller more accurate adjustments and the strings actually hold the tuning for much longer than beforeGreat product Buy it use it and be happy They work Great Just as advertised,positive
Its great to have a few extra mic clips on hand and for the price these are great They hold SM5857 perfectly Not cheap or poorly made at all a great value Great mic clip for the money,positive
Wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environmentSo far works wellSometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string but generally works great Can tune up quickly every time Im pleased,positive
I bought one of these in the beginning just to have something as this is better than having nothing at all but its certainly nothing special The material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain so I only used it for a very short timeOn the other hand if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of then youll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point I upgraded to a really nice 334 wide black leather Levys guitar strap which is five stars all the wayIf youre a newbie and dont have a strap and are on a tight budget and need something then this Planet waves strap will probably work for you till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear Just my 2 cents You get what you pay for,negative
I was upset when I bought the mic stand and didnt know the clip didnt come with itSo I had to order a clip laterNevertheless It has good design to dampen the shocksIt is also rubber in construction so it wont crack like the other low quality clipsIt is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is goodI would recommend it holds well but not firm enough,positive
I admit I havent had it long but so far so good I have a Gator pedal board that came with their power supply Unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable The PS is fine but the cable is shorting out Couldnt find another cable so I thought Id find another solution with a more generic cable This Joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition which made me a little skeptical I may never need all its features but for what I need powering 5 devices it is doing the job beautifully My pedal board includes tuner chorus and octaver stomp boxes a bass DI and a Rolls headphone amp The JP02 frees me up from any other wall warts Money Now I just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board Great power supply,positive
Im not on tour with any group I play for church and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home with other musicians willing to give their time plus an occasional gig for a town celebration or some such activity Ive got a few sound effects pedals and processors I like using but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds 6 or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car This mini PedalTrain easily holds four of my favorite devices it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy etc The case is awesome too heavy dutygood stuff The board came with velcro tie wraps power head etc to mount and use your devices I had it up and running in a few minutesand it makes my travelandplay experiences easy without looking for a roadie to get help The angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect Clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect Since I first got it Ive rearranged once already Talk about easy Youll be glad to have your sound effects mounted wired and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the weartear on wires from just handling I finally found just the right unit for my music equip needs,positive
I started doing quite a bit of VoiceOver work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk After attaching it to a microphone stand I found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the Yeti Microphone This seemed like the best option for thatUpon installing the mount I had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me Straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you Unfortunately if your microphone stand is coming from the sides you have to take the inner ring out rotate it to where you want it and reattach the rubber bands Easy enough as I completed this is one minuteAfter using it for a while the isolation is good but not great I think the bands are a little tight for this microphone I see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder This probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount It needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings I have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bandsGoing to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a differenceIts does its job it just could do it better with softer bands Solid Shockmount for Yeti,positive

Im taking my KORG CA30 which has no backlight slow reset time and a ridiculous stand feature put a business card in the slot in the back and try to find a level surface for it to stand upon and putting it in my sock drawer with my decades old guitar pitch pipe Also going in there is my Intellitouch tuner which drives me nuts with the arrows and does not fit securely on my fiddleFor my fiddle mandolin and guitar Ill use my just received Intelli IMT500 which is very compact great for fiddlemando cases which has an outstanding backlight superb accuracy and quick resettingThe Intelli in its own manufacturers box which has no shockabsorbing materialwas placed in a larger shipping box by the distributorseller The Instrument Store without any shockabsorbing material leaving the Intelli a very sensitive electronic metering devicesubject to vibration and shock during the long trip down the east coastIt would be good for Amazon to teach sellers the basics of proper packing for shippingIts not rocket science 5 Stars Intelli Less for distributor,positive
In life you mostly get what you pay for This stand really isnt an exception Getting what you pay for though doesnt mean that it wont do what you need it to do This stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it The great thing is it doesnt need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do Its a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played Even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a caseFor 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar Putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play You now have no excuse for your expensive or cheap guitar to get beat up from laying around Does the job doesnt cost much,positive
How in the World can they sell a very good microphone for 15The cord that comes with it is worth more than thatBought it to hear how my harmonicas would sound ampedVery good sound quality plenty of gainWould reccommend this for voice or instrument use Has a 14in jack to easily plug into a guitar ampIf you need a good Mic or Mics dont want to break the budget get one or a bunch of emYou wont feel so bad when one falls off the stage breaks Youll still have a nice cord you can use on any MicVery good purchaseJoe Speak into the Mic,positive
it is not a replacement for a TS 808 or 09 but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough good tone but even better price,positive
I originally was planning on purchasing 2 3 packs of xm1800s but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainerI was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every songI really wanted Sure SM588217s but the budget did not allow itI normally stay away from Behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc but these microphones were a game changer for meThey have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives also an excellent output level to the mixerI was able to EQ them easily for both male and female vocal ranges I was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitorsI was also able to get a nice even mix on the front endI do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now A very good budget live vocal microphone,positive
i ordered with my new guitar These straps are quite flexible lengthwise so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldnt get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position you will not be disappointed here Great product,positive

I bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect Then I reordered and I got what I think was an acoustic type because they were the same 20mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold so I just ended up with two dozen wasted picks So just make sure you get the right one12511 Update Okay so I just realized that there are Dunlop Stubby Picks and then there are Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks Sorry Make sure you get the right pick,positive
Not easy to set up hard to tighten down Works well enough as a filter once you get it placed Wobbly,neutral
Easy to use and the clip is sturdy A bit slow compared to the Snarks I own but I like it Nice tuner,positive
This stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging If you need a boom simply add anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom Blackand youre good to goIn addition to being indestructible this stand takes up far less stage or studio real estate than a tripod type stand like theOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand And despite the relatively small size of the base it is far more stable than the tripod stands Admittedly this stand is a great deal heavier so if weight is an issue you may not like this typeEven with a boom fully extended I have found this stand to be stable For outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright which is not always the case with the tripod types Moreover there are no legs to break I have lost one tripod stand to that problemIf you transport your gear often and especially if you play outside or inside on cramped stages this stand is the best choice in my opinion Perfect for heavy gigging schedules including touring,positive
This is another in the MXR Distortion line The Distortion III has a more overdrive flavor than a high gain pedal like the Boss Metal Zone or the Barber Dirty Bomb but is very flexible Not really for heavy metal see the MXR 116 Fullbore Metal but more for that ACDC and classic rock soundThere is a lot of gain on tap from the output section so it is possible to hit the front of a tube amp hard without turning up the distortion The tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useableThe good thing about this pedal apart from the price is you do not get that fizzy top end that some pedals have when you crank the distortion In addition the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knobPedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly MXR does it again,positive
I have a gibson les paul that I bought used When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry I first tried lemon oil and it would work but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it its rosewood So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honeyI ordered it and applied it A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didnt care for the way the fretboard felt I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasnt completely dry I decided to give it another 24 hoursThe next day the guitar neck looked and played great It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ Bends and slides are smoother than everGreat product and one that I will continue to use If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation Great conditioner better than lemon oil,positive
This single pedal unit has a lot of amazing and suprising effects A lot of overdrivedistortions filters modulations delays reverbs all carefully modeled I put M5 sidebyside with the 34real one34 with a AB switch and dont heard differences Im using in musics where I need programed delays like U2 or Pink Floyd or when I need a specific effect I only use Tremolo in 1 music and this gear help me to save my money A surprising digital effect,positive

these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch Ernie Ball strings are garbage the only time I will buy these is if its the only thing available most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh you can spend 4 for a set of Ernie Ball or DAddario every 2 days or you can spend 7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month or you can spend 10 for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months It doesnt make sense to use these crappy Ernies unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars Rusts in a matter of 2 days,negative
I received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar This is the second one I have and it works well I have a built in tuner but the Snark is so easy to use and inexpensive it is a great deal I would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player Best acoustic tuner,positive
This tuner really delivers its inexpensive and accurate much better than the SN1 Do not be fooled by the broader gradients on the SN 8 if you are in the green you are in tune SN 8 is also far more reliable no notorious having to adjust the neck to get a reading as in the SN 1 and 2 I use mine with ukulele and guitars and both get tuned accurately with it Excellent,positive
Thank goodness Amazon doesnt sell this gadget for the fortydollar retail price tagI just got mine today and tried it out The sound quality complaints are no joke There is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the iRig or iPhone while playing will create a loud static noise Dont know if a better quality jack on the iRig wouldve solved this problem or notBut if youre willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings you may find a happy medium that you can live withStill the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool If I find the need to really use one of these Ill probably spring for something that plugs into the iPhone dock connector Until then thisll be a fun toy to play withMarch 29 2012 Just a quick addendum to my initial review Ive since discovered the noise filter in the AmpliTube iPhone app and wow what a difference It sounds much much better now No more hiss no more static Fun toy til youre ready for something better,neutral
Came on time Work great for my needs Geart for setups and takedowns Does lengthen the strap a bit but works Works Great,positive
I chose a 5 star rating because ive simply never owned a tuner of this high quality in my lifetime This tuner blows away my old Guitar ProfessorQwik Tune Tuner This tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion Price for tuner justified by awesome quality of tuner,positive
Great little pedal economical and worked flawlessly It didnt have a power supply or battery included for a low price what do you expect Besides batteries arent that expensive Cranked out a nice distortion for my Fender guitar Great product Great little pedal,positive
This strap is really beautiful The Native American pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar I made with the images of wolves burned into the top However the leather ends are very thick and stiff making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar I tried to put the snapon strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an Exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them I have a nice Ralph Marlin strap with soft pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort workable with one hand Id give this Levys strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible Leather ends extremely stiff,neutral
These are okay strings for the Folk Guitarnothing special but the price isnt out of the world either Good buy for the money Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good Okay Strings for folk guitar,positive
My son says these picks are great to use because of the rubber grippers that make it easier to holdespecially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time Highly recommend Dava 6024 Grip Tip Picks are awesome,positive
Ive been using these straplocks for over 10 years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studiothey simply work and cost next to nothing to boot Folks this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage its not going anywhere This is a must have just buy it Great straplocks,positive
Good strings for the price nice ring to them So far they seem to last and were a bit louder than my last strings although they were flat round and did expect them to be very loud Good strings for the price,positive

should have kept thisI returned it cause I purchased a zoom r16big mistake miss it on smaller projects and my mxl990 sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixermy uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks he thinks it great too loved it,positive
This capo isnt quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar If I position it just so it will work as long as I dont bump it or a string will pop out of one side Not Wide Enough,negative
These are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price I love the flat low profile right angle plugs My only complaint is I needed some in varying lengths like 1534 and so I had to order the Planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard Excellent for pedal board,positive
I have two Behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations Small yet clean and versatile Great for gigging remote events A great value for the money Great unit,positive
For the price this is a pretty nice strap Its thin but does the job well The simulated leather end pieces are noticeably 34cheap34 but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet Nice Affordable Vintage Looking Strap,positive
This brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings To me they just sound complete Even the light strings dont sound tinny which amazed me compared to other big names They complement my Washburns very well Though they are not top of the line models I often get compliments like 34youre guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone34 But its been a trial error for me I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned Good sound,positive
I love this wah Its just perfect I really cant find any negative about it Its just a perfect standard wah You wont regret this purchase at all Just put a good analog fuzz after it youre good to go Original is still 1,positive
Great slap echo sound Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay its closer to a reverb It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile an old engineering trick Great for old school rock and roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp As with all FAB pedals I find the knob placement slightly annoying but at this price point you cant really make a justifiable complaint Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year Great slap back for a great price,positive
I received the Fender cable exactly as shown in the pictureIt is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain reliefIt looks great was fairly cheap and built to last great for the price,positive
I have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables They havent had a huge amount of use but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise and Ive bought over 10 of them Solid Product,positive
Oh Man My Guitars have a new home love this stand looks nice and works excellent currently I have a Strat Style guitar a bass and a Epi Les Paul hanging on this baby but even with just one guitar it holds up just fine No unsteadiness no wiggling Big space saver definitely a Good Pick Great for home use or on the road it folds up nicely great padding on heads and body supports 10 out of 10 on this one Great stand,positive
I cant hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast pointless,negative
I really like the soft flexible cable these have They were perfect for my pedal board Highly recommended You will find yourself wanting more than you purchased Good cables,positive
Got what I paid for Worth the money definitely Sturdy and stable and I need more words so I can done Got what I paid for Worth the money definitely,neutral
This strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff The only issue I have with it is that the ends are not the same size so I could not install my Dunlop Straploks for it It may just have been the one I got though Feels great,positive
I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap the first one arrived in non working condition wires inside werent even soldered so i ordered a replacement plugged it in and it didnt work either the second wasnt soldered eitherI know its cheap but i expected it to at least work do not buy broke,negative
There is a lot to think about with a strap lock Is it 100 sturdy 100 reliable Does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar Can it fit in a case or does it make you take the strap off every time you put your guitar awayThe FenderSchaller design covers all of these bases well I believe it is 100 sturdy and reliable Unlike its Dunlop competition the stress on the guitar is roughly equivalent to plain strap buttons It will not fit in all cases but will fit in manyIve switched over to this design and couldnt be happier with itNOTE I advise using a crescent wrench and a socket to tighten the nut One always wants to avoid overtightening but the risk of undertightening is high without proper leverage If you dont really tighten the nut down you are likely to have things fall apart while playing some day Excellent Design and Manufacturing,positive
Despite its iFlavor it works beautifully with my PC Sounds better than any sound card ive used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency Its a great intro model not just for ipads Whole device is powered and runs over one USB cord Im so impressed my main PC audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device Its an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with REAPER Great for PCs TOO,positive

I play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun Thats all I can say It makes me creative and I have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this Its just fun Lots of fun,positive
Look its a plastic box thats just 5534 square and 2534 deep with a cheap threeinch speaker inside It produces decent sound although theres substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital 34static34 from my computer Its OK as a practice amp but I certainly wouldnt want to perform with it In short its only a small step above toy level which is what youd expect for a twentydollar amp That doesnt mean its not useful but you need to be realistic about what youre getting here Keep your expectations low,neutral
This is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on Amazon The strap feels sturdy and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy Definitely glad I bought this Lightning Strikes,positive
Its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle The only bad thing is you have to squeeze really hard to get the oil out Good,positive

This does what you expect it stands up a guitar What can else can be said It has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents It is portable folds up easily for storage I usually have a guitar on it all the time It stands up my Guitar,positive
I like the way the Snark attaches to all of my guitars and a mandolin It reacts quickly and is not oversensitive The way the mounting and dial articulate make it easy to set up while not interfering with the tuning knobs Easy to read and for the very low price a great value However and this may be my own fault I often need to snap my finger against the dial to get it to start reading I say my own fault because I put the battery in wrong the first time and had to pull it out with needlenose pliers That may have damaged a contact I play with a number of other people that have Snarks and they all work properly I would buy another one without hesitation Good value,positive
First the goods Sturdy leather construction just cant be beat the color is spot on with the pictures shownThe Bads Its a bit short I have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the 34shoe lace around the head stock34 method I had to max this strap out to make the span Im a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldnt have this problem Then theres the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadnt considered It drags and pulls your shirt really bad making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang That problem is not specific to this strap but the material its made out of Its high quality but I didnt consider it trying to pull my shirt off If had to do over again Id pass comes up a little short,neutral
This is a great little keyboard for use with GarageBand on the iPad GarageBand recognizes it as a controller for the Keyboard Smart Keyboard Sampler Smart Guitar Smart Bass and Drums You can even solo on the Akai keyboard while the Smart Keyboard autoplays an accompaniment In addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard this Akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than whats built into GarageBand for iPadUnlike other keyboard controllers Ive tried this one plugs and plays with the iPadno powered USB hub required You do need Apples Camera connection Kit of course to add a USB port to your iPad Its not loaded with gimmicksjust the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed The keys are 85 of standard width which is large enough for fumblefree playing Its lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an iPad accessory Perfect for GarageBand on iPad,positive
This little foot stool is really sturdy It stays in place beautifully No rocking sideways no wobbly actionIf one of the notches doesnt do it for you youre screwed Theres no gradual adjustment But the positions it allows make sense for 99 of players strong and sturdy perfect for the price,positive
This item was purchased because Im doing selfteaching on the fiddle I figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while Im learning Since Im used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go I like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions I also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you wantIt did take some measuring to get this in place I had to be very careful to put it on squarely The closer I got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line but not so much that it would affect how to use the templateOne things I had to deal with was to make sure I had a MM measuring devise The bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut It took some doing but I was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes Make sure you have metric measuring device,positive

i had a dr07 that i loved but it mysteriously walked out during a gig we played at a local bar i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less i never used the reverb or overdubbing capabilities of the dr 07 anyway and i usually used it with the mics folded in i have recorded several rehearsals with this one and i cant tell a difference between the recordings i made with the dr 07 and the recordings from this one this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals makes good recordings,positive
Ive used DAddarios on so many different Guitars the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best In the Studio or on Stage They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using I put these on My Wifes Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time Makes a Cheap Bass sound REAL,positive
This guitarist tool is a real gem its well designed to pull string pegs wind strings and cut the strings all in a small package I find it handy useful and I recommend it A Gem,positive

Ok reviewing somethings I just dont see the need Ok that being said I searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedalsthis came up first and is IMO all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons I dont know what else to say The cord isnt very long but not overly short either I have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc ok for now thats all I got I may edit later on down the line It works,positive
I say this one is more between a Fender Medium and heavy But it has the star for grip and that is super Hard not to like Get some Next best size in star picks,positive

I prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars Im surprised I havent broken it yet Sturdy,positive
As a classical guitarist I have never touched a pick to my nylon strings As a recent ukulele enthusiast however I have a little different approach In a group if all are acoustic a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers I tried these Nothing against them They are good for strumming For lead I needed to use something harder I went to a soft plastic or nylon pick It will still not be too good for the strings but it does the sonic job I needFor a nice strum these are fine Good for what they are made for,positive

Finally I found a long strap for my new guitar I had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short It felt like my guitar hung around my neck This new strap is plenty long enough and looks good My only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most players will feel it on their neck but it sure fits nice and long I would recommend this to any guitar player A long Strap,positive

This snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely Charlie It hears things I dont and tells me whether they are what I want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or togetherIf you like being in tune this is probably for you It is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything You can clamp it on a cats tail but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so dont even think about doing that you sickoGreat design easy to read works better than 2 other brand tuners I own only bummer is you cant carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one If it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars oh wellI suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool hip out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity oh the peer pressure snark hunting for amatuers,positive
If you are considering this guitar I have to assume youre shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom It is in the category of beginnerintermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrumentI really couldnt find anything wrong with it Yes it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls such as having only two controls for volume and tone rather than four which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson But you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique rather than fussing around with tone controls anywayThe sound is good and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine The pickups are surprisingly good The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good although it would sure be nice if they didnt cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound qualityAs for fit and finish reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying For several reasons if I had this to do over I would not buy it online nor would I buy it from GC Better to inspect the actual guitar youll be buying and dont be shy about asking them bring out another one if you dont like the first one you seeI discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price but they would have included a full professional setup including string change You are likely to find a similar deal where you live because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GCAs it is I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup It had some intonation problem the action was too high and as others have commented the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners as Id read a lot of people trashing the tuners Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them he instead assured me that they were fairly decent and advised against changing them unless a problem developsOut of the box I was a little unsure of my purchase However now that its been fully set up and new strings installed I am quite pleased with this guitar I dont believe you will find a better guitar or even close at this price levelI did a lot of shopping and considered guitars up to 500 for my first foray into electric I was tempted to go with something more expensive on the theory that in a couple years Ill want to upgrade anyway Now Im glad I chose this one For one thing this is a guitar Ill always enjoy having around There is nothing cheap or toylike about it In 23 years my tastes may change I may want something completely different down the road and now I still have that option Had I gone with a more expensive model Id feel locked in No goodBOTTOM LINE If youre shopping for a guitar in this price range I think youll be pleased with this guitar Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar youre buying and negotiate to have a setup included because it will almost certainly need one Have it set up right install some quality strings and youll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II Nice guitar and a great value,positive
I actually like this bench a lot It fits into my gear back rolling duffle style that contains my cables power strips etc with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag I have the KT7800 which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust Depends on your preference I suppose this one is smaller lighter the other is larger easier to adjust smaller than On Stage KT7800 Plus Keyboard Bench,positive
Recently I switched from a Blackstar HT5 to a Fender Mustang III V2 amp Although the Fender is a great sounding amp you dont get this natural warmth that you get with tubes theres this liveliness thats missing So although my cleans sound good they arent great Although my overdrive sounds good its not great Although my distortion well you get the pictureSince adding this pedal was less expensive than buying a new amp I decided to give it a try This pedal adds the same kind of sparkle to your sound that you would get from using a clean boost on a tube amp I believe some people call it 34pixie dust34 that little bit of magic that makes your sound come aliveInterestingly enough I dont leave this pedal on all the time But when I stack pedals or use certain effects like chorus a shimmer reverb or any effect with the exception of maybe a leslie its pretty awesomeIt works different than an EQ and if you have a tube amp a clean boost may do the same thing I think it really adds life to solid state amps If you dont have a tube amp you need one of these,positive
I ordered two of these stands and they work very well Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things Fantastic for the price,positive
Ive been using these 20s as my primary pick for years now and I love them The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick Theyre very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidentlyYou will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the picks tip When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost After playing a bit the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time Eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice you wont care My Long Time Favorite,positive
What can I say these are great patch cablesSolid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that I could detect And Ive had crappy cables that buzzed when you looked at them crosseyed these dont do that No gold connectors and if you need the best of the best maybe you should be looking elsewhere For the rest of us who are looking for good stuff at a good price these are the ticketHighly recommended Excellent patch cables for the price,positive

been using these cables for three months now I use them with aZoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedaland they sound great decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research I found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time they have a good lenght of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues youll be playing so far Ive only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig Ive got coming up the end of the month so far so good,positive
I have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it I could never quite get the fine tune I was looking for and I have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear These little tuners are amazing So easy to use and portable and cheap I have several now one for every guitar Cheap is important because they are made of plastic and I have had one break at the joint after a lot of use I also received one without a battery which upset me at the time I am in Afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by If you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money These tuners are awesome but consider them disposable,positive
Very nice guitar hanger easy to install and it floats away from the wall the back of the guitar never touches the wall Nice hanger,positive
Ive been very disappointed with this tuner When Ive used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the rightsharp then back to the leftflat I have two2 other tuners I bought from WalMart and I always get accurate tunings from them I bought this KORG because its a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation Even though my tow2 WalMart tuners are older they both still work better than this KORG Disappointment,negative
I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago and I dont recall having this issue so Im thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle and the locks are secure However due to this issue Im considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon Screws strip too easy but good if you can screw in,neutral
it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget priceworks great with moonflowers and lasers I have gottenthe fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lightsI really wanted to use it Halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didnt want it out on the porchnext year cheap trick,positive
I didnt know when I ordered these mic stands that they were On Stage stands They are fully adjustable great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics Excellent quality Im very happy with this set Two great mic stands one low price Great value,positive
This is my first electric tuner As a percussionistturnedbassplayer I goofed off stick twirled and snored through countless hours of tuning in band class over the years Not surprisingly I kind of laughed at my own peril when it came time to tune my new instrument I grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed It does the trick Its small accurate enough to get by with general practice I can correct minor tuning issues by ear However now that I have been using it for a few months I have noticed that it does not give a very stable reading of pitch For example if I go through and tune all the strings it will read a hair highlow on the next pass and yet again on a third pass If you need something 34nofuss34 and accurate the first time around to the spot you might want to invest in something a little more robust But for standardpractice tuning this is a fine accessory Gets the job done,positive
Ive owned the same one for 10 years and its still going strong after many gigs The spring tension is just right Solid Construction Works well,positive
Well This work well with my Uke and there is a review that pretty much sum it up Put it on the headstock Put the mic on the headstock,positive
I picked this up because I wanted to change up the looks of my 3tone sunburst American Standard The holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install but thats what youd expect since this is a genuine Fender part The only concern really is whether or not the color will work on your guitar At first it took some getting used to as it really darkened up the look of my Strat but I like the way it came out with aged white pick up covers and knobs Fits like a glove and looks great,positive
I purchased a Classical guitar and only had a traditional steel string Capo available to me Not thinking it through I used it on my Nylon Stings and after a few times I realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced Along with my string order I added this Capo so it does not happen againProsIts small and lightweightIts very well made It not only looks great but also appear to be of high qualityIts very adjustable Unlike my steel string Capo this uses a screwknob to tighten not spring loaded This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stingsIt works on steel strings Yep I found my self needing a Capo on another guitar and only having this with me I saw no reason it should not work so I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully I wont be using it full time on my steel strings but great to know in a pinch I have use itIf you need a great capo thats gentle on your Nylon strings then this is the one to get Perfect for classical Nylon String guitar,positive
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap No directions inside or on the box I messed with it for about 5 minutes I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic I read the description but it did not say cheap Live and learn Toy mic boom,negative
This is a pretty decent guitar If you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board Was disappointed that the electronics are a tuner that you have to switch from string to string why would they put a tuner in this six string guitar that is made for a seven string and a volume nob that goes from low to high No tone control no presence control Hint Dont go to guitar shops and play a better guitar than you can afford It will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking Good for price,positive
Rugged robust flexible Couldnt ask for more in a momentary switch Like all Boss products it will probably last longer than me Best momentary switch on the market,positive
JF15again OMFG The MK type sounds take awhile to get so tweak consider your amp settings guitar type etc The other pedals like it in the series Im intrigued by but I can get any sound I want so far with my stuff I tried both the Joyo JF02 Ultimate Drive OCD clone pedals individually on Strats an LP a Harrington through my slightly modded VC5212Webber speakerstube amp clean channel As with any pedal it wont make you a better player Only practicing gear research use and your hands touchgripwhatever you kids call it these dayswill have the final say of what comes out of the amp I intentionally got the JF02 after reading positive reviews all over the net The JF15 was a curiosity purchase I was able to dial in sounds of Anthrax Stryper stratty Buddy Guy bluesremember he uses a metal finger tip clip at timesworks with Pickboy metal picks the dad friendly radio rock sounds of Nickelback Daughtry Foo Fightersto get your Marshall sounds takes a bit of work but I use their Blues Breaker II reissue Reflector and sometimes the crushing JackHammera BBII with more options and gain I also use a digitech valve Hardwire for vintage 70s rock or switched to saturation and mid scooped for the Pantera sounds So in closing this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a Boogieish sound if you know what youre doing for the sound your leaning to MK Clone,positive
Works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation Its a decent djannouncer mic or for a PA but i wouldnt record anything like singing or music and expect great sound Has that great heavy mic feel but is definitely no SHURE mic despite the similarities Reasonable for the price,neutral
I used this for a while but now I have the behringer 8ch rack mount and this rarely gets used Also every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when I was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp I still use this for practice at home Great piece of gear to have on hand,positive
I do live shows online and my older Behringer mixer does not have the built in USB port so these digitizers do a great job for me I constantly get comments about how clean and clear my sound is and while I largely attribute that to the mixer this digitizer is just as important a link in the chain Very simple to use audio out of the mixer goes into this digitizer plug the USB cable into my computer my streaming software sees it and people hear me I am definitely a Behringer fan Simple to use and does its job well,positive
Dunlop always makes topnotch products so when it came time to find a slide I knew where to look This one produces a great tone and is wellmade Like the other reviewers mention here you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits For general home use though I wouldnt worry about it too much though Great AllPurpose Slide Meant For Ring Finger Use,positive
Great guitar companies dont always make or sell under their aegis the best strings I love my Teles but I cant stand Fender strings Likewise I love my Martin ukulele but trying these strings for the second time I had the same conclusion as I did the first Aquilas are far better Aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner Aquilas take a couple of days or more but the sound is thinner and the feel isnt nearly as friendly The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not for me worth the lesser satisfaction even on my least expensive ukes Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings the higherpriced Aquilas still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks Use the Martins or any cheaper string when you are working on your uke put the stress of repeatedly detuning and retuning on them Then switch to Aquilas for playing Some may like the Martins but few wont love the Aquilas Aquila is better,neutral
I had to send my first one back The second one is working fine so far Ive noticed it works better with some DAWs than others also If you are having problems with it it could be you DAW software It works great with Reaper First One Didnt Work Very Long,neutral
Bought this for my husbands Mandolin and he loves it it works great we swear by Kyser thats all we use on our guitars is Kyser capos great product no complaints and the price is worth it Works Great,positive
Great little tooland very handy a bargain and a good buy Does not mar my guitar and is easy to seeThanks Snark SN5 Tuner for Guitar Bass and Violin,positive
They seem the same but the original schallers that came with my tele deluxe 2008 are bigger and stronger for the lack of a better word still a good buy I like the Original Schallers better yet they are good,positive
I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos but this new one is not very well designed The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards I find my left hand hitting the lever when Im in open position Frustrating It does have a pick holder which can be handy and a place to put an NS tuner which can also be handy I just think it could have been better designed I dont particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff Ill stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser cumbersome,negative
it holds about 6 to 7 picks pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate would recommend handy little unit,positive
One Spot has become the standard It is not cheap but it is well made and useful With this you get the power adapter the extension cable to hook up multiple stomp boxes and a bag full of converter cables The power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outletSo far I have used it successfully only to power two pedals so I cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board But I am sure it would do so without issue as I have seen other do it without a complaint Smart Functional The Standard,positive
I bought this so I can keep some extra picks handy now if I can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand Or to the desk where I sit and play Maybe I should just get one for each spot and each instrument Yeah I think a few of these would be nice Works great,positive
This is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar If you dont enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but dont like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar wont slip out of the strap while youre playing then upgrade to this system Excellent Product,positive
I really like these things I dont stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea Bought a few while back and just bought a few more If you drop a pick there is another right there Have fun this is second batch i ordered,positive
I dont do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear I like the metal connecters they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heftIt is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price I will be buying these again Great for the money,positive
Im using this in V1 in a 5 watt tube amp Its really nice I tried the NOS route and I much prefer this tube The other good thing is it comes in a box from JJ unlike some tubes from other places Ive ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them Warm and articulate with pleasant distortion,positive
After going to various guitarmusic stores and trying out many guitars YamahaIbanez Fender and others I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this makemodel and saw the MANY positive reviews it had I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally costing me 129 After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online The many reviews were absolutely correct THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought Even though it is only an 89 guitar I will treasure this one as if it was 300 Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave Low action and stays in tune for days Best Guitar at even TWICE the Price,positive
Total flimsy junk It leans WAYYY too far back Ill be damned if I put my 1000 guitars on these things On the other hand ChromaCast makes one thats very close to this price and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paidIn summary DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK Terrible I wouldnt trust even a beater guitar on this stand No way Forget it,negative
Disclaimers1 Obtained free as part of Amazons Vine program2 Tested on 4 ukuleles and one guitarSo ukulele players Yes this tuner is for youI tested this diminutive tuner on Sopranino Ohana Soprano Pono Concert Kala 8string Tenor PonoIts TINY so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there Its a bit problematic on the Sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the topTuning is easy Just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen If its red youre off if its green youre in tuneWhen youre off little bars will display by the note letter left if youre low right if youre high Tune in the direction needed until theres one bar on each side of the note and the notes name turns green Quick and easyIve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and its dead accurateAs others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock But its held together fine so far and Ive had it for weeks Small Accurate,positive
Im a keyboard player and in the past I had been spending 4060 for Monsters delegated keyboard cables But suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use causing me to question the Monster mystique I began to compare the Monster keyboard cables with cheap offbrand guitar cables and couldnt hear any difference No question its a wellmade trustworthy but not indestructible or infallible cable but Im no longer committed to it at any price However at Amazons current value price for this particular Monster cable its a nobrainer Moreover I no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesnt say piano or keyboard on it One of my Monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrumentbut it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit clubAs for length 6 feet is ideal if youre playing through your own amp my preference If youre plugging into a board or PA system youll want anywhere from 12 feet to 25 feet Monster of a Deal,positive
Ive been playing guitar my entire life And Ive tried almost every pick there is After hearing how great it is I decided to buy it It felt really small at first and i kinda was dissapointed I put it down and didnt use it for quite some time For some reason i decided to pick it back up and after a few minutes i came to like the pick Days after using it i got accustomed to its size and I became much more efficient with picking And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping I cant really go back to normal sized picks now haha Thats like the only downside I can think of There are many dif versions of this style so buy em all and try em out If these dont work for you you can always buy the Vpick Give em some time youll like em,positive
I must say in the beginning I was not thrilled with the product The coloring that it adds is relatively subtle unless cranked however after using it for several weeks then not using it I did notice a difference I found that using it as a gain input to the distortion pedal results in some very warm sweet sounding crunch very nice The type of coloring is available through a dip switch which I guess is ok Not highly accessible though All in all this has stayed in my effects chain between the wah wah and the distortion box I normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal No plans to remove Not noticeable until you turn off,positive
Most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything I would say however I still want to say I love this tool Not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt its been useful to help me learn the letters of keys Slowly I am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that I know where I am on the fretboard where I can go from there I use it by putting it on my music stand dialing in the key I want turn on the drum machine simply play the chords in that key to the beat Then when I want to practice the relevant scales of the key I simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note Its that easyI will say that I do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with Most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned To really grasp it one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly But with rote repetition eventually comes that Eureka moment from time to time more falls into placeUnlike some others Im not one to lug something this around in my gig bag Who really is going to set study material like this prior to a gig Thats what you do at home and its called Practice for a reasonI give this 5 out of 5 stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory If not you may want to take some lessons then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons Useful tool,positive
I was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad I didThis stand is VERY sturdy well made durableFoam padded everywhere guitar touches Can be folded for easy transport Rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hardPleasently surprised at the quality of this standHighly recommended very happy with purchaseJoe Guitar Stand,positive
I love the idea of this but I wish I had spent more for a better quality version I had seen them used by others and chose this one but it is not well made The number dial is not accurate and is loose so as you are using it you have to keep checking that it has not moved It works but Ill probably end up getting a better one Good concept,neutral
Its ok It does what it says but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background Meh,neutral
Ive had the same tuner for years I decided to upgrade I got this because it had alot of good reviews and it was fairly cheap It tunes better than any tuner Ive ever used Worth every penny Magnificent,positive
These are great strings for such a rare instrument Not many people play the baritone yuke it has a unique quality to it sort of like a miniature classical guitar These strings sound full and warm on the instrument good strings,positive
I bought this because my bands primary PA mixer doesnt have highimpedance inputs for a guitar pickup and I dont always want to bring my submixer for quickchange gigs So a small cheap DI box seemed like a good solutionThe PDC21 is a nofrills device It converts a 14 instrument cable high Z to a balancedunbalanced 14 or XLR low Z signal It does a fine job I dont notice it coloring the sound ie its not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted although it does lower the volume somewhat Thats to be expected in a passive DI box and it doesnt bother meIm using it with an LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup The M1A spits out a fairly hot signal and I dont have any problem with the signal loss associated with the PDC21 If I were using a passive pickup in my guitar the results might be differentBottom line its small fairly light seems durable and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the XLR inputs our PA mixer requires It does everything I wanted and the price was right I see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one Portable works fine with active guitar pickup,positive
Behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so I was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far so good The mic preamps sound pretty good clean and relatively quiet The knobs and slider feel smooth and well madeIt also seems to send hotter signal to my JBL EON 510s and thats a good thingThe builtin effects are probably its weakest point Ive heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unitI also wish that the Control Room knob and outputs were independent of the Main Output slider That would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer So all in all not too shabby for a 11000 mixer but I probably wouldnt use it for recording Not a bad little mixer,positive
For the price I think its hard to get any better than this I love this case It fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes Its light and feels comfortable when you carry it Had mine for 2 years now and no complaints still as good as new The look is not that inspiring but it protects your guitar Some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but Ive had no problems with mine great for travel,positive
Works well easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers Ive had Simple and it works,positive
Very useful great,positive
First the reasons why I awarded this five stars the construction is uniformly excellent Both ends have strain reliefs the 18 connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it and the XLR end is a quality componentI purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in myPowerwerks 50 Watt Personal PA Systeminto something more useable This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapterAnother reason why I love this is its noise free In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit I have not had that problem with this one so its another plusOverall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one Its a bit pricier than others I considered but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium Solved a big issue for me,positive
This pad is great for midi VSTis Drums Queuing and its got great action Works great with Ableton Reason FL Studio Cantabile Performer and a whole bunch more DAWs and hostsThe software is a little lame and doesnt always work properly but you dont really need it that much anyways so its whatever Hardware is great Software is very lame,positive
Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside first to slide down the cable with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters Unfortunately that design isnt used here but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15 of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends M and F for well under 1ftAs for pinout its straightforward pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart and the rubber bumper design on the back which I havent had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineers kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arisesAnother favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above which amazon will rush youGLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables 3 Balanced Snake Cord 6 PACK these are very easy to open an end change phase lift ground or input someones oddball source signal Having 6 on hand means you wont quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mixBack to pyles product here I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and rewire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since its 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot Its also great when someone yells its too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasnt planned for or got movedquit working For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showingI finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to RCA 14 TRS hiz transformers and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems and a roll of gaffers tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 25mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin Even though all this was under 100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on so a bit of what if thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owners daughers toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magicMy last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made It will no doubt be needed again and since you made it youll know why how and where it was used before thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didnt serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that stereo channel in rehersal at the console This gets 5 stars for value but doesnt use my favorite XLR end,positive
This will last a very long time due its sturdy construction Two pieces easy to set up in seconds Great buy for the ONLY MINE WAS A HAMILTON Outstanding,positive
I bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was Easy to use and handy for ANY string instrumentsOnly thing i regret is not getting one sooner Snark clip on,positive
A very attractive and well constructed strap Ive been somewhat disappointed with some of the more expensive straps but this one is ExcellentAND NOT SO EXPENSIVE All the Buttons fit well Snug and it adjusts easily and quickly Just what I was looking for,positive
This is a product that is unique tiny and would be very useful if it were more accurate The problem is its just not responsive enough To get it to work one has to place it low on the headpiece next to the nut and strum a string pretty loud for a consistent register Placing it at the top of the headpiece it simply doesnt pick up enough string vibration to register wellThe problem with placing it next to the nut is that it then makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wallmount guitar hanger That may seem like a small issue but not if you use such a device regularly as many homeplayers do Myself I have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wallThat doesnt make this valueless You can always clip it on the top of the headpiece and then move it when youre ready to tune Thus I give it 3 stars However there are other more responsive tuners such as the capotuners weve seen on Amazon lately Theyre about the same price actually the capo tuners are a bit lessexpensive but Ive found the capotuners to be considerably more responsiveSo bottom line Im not impressed These arent an expensive tuner comparatively speaking and thats good But they really dont do all that great a job Theyre unresponsive enough that I honestly think a person might break a string before realizing the tuner isnt responding to the current string pluckNote to Ovation guitar players this is not the clipon tuner for you Theres simply no place to clip it Fortunately my Ovation has builtin tuning but if you have an Ovation Acoustic youll want a different tuner Interesting design but not nearly responsive enough,neutral
Does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it The handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles Over all a nice product Does the job,positive

Bought this because of all the great reviews ButThis doesnt work just like the last Beringer product I bought Will I ever learn Very disappointingUPDATE Now working got my mate an Aussie genius to have a lookFound pedal wasnt engaging when pushed downTook plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on sheer geniusWorked fine with cover off then replaced cover with new bit of rubber And it still worksAmazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though Doesnt work,negative
I bought this stand because I needed support for larger songbooks that my metal foldup could not provide I really really like it Others in my music groups that have seen it have also gone out and ordered one It assembles quickly and easily and folds up into a nice package for transport Every once in a while I have to tighten the lock cams but that is no issue It is very sturdy and holds big music books very well Great portable music stand,positive
Works great on my 100 watt Amp Almost compares to a monster cable And with Its length Its plenty of Room from your Guitar to amp GOOD PRODUCT Works Good No complaints,positive
looks really cool and sounds great no buzz or unwanted noise with these cables and they have a velcro strap which makes it easy to store them when you are done i like them a lot tweed guitar cable,positive
It does everything its supposed to do I got these for about 12 here on Amazon The Dunlop or Schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that I can seeThey lock securely dont require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitars hardwareI have both Dunlop and Hennessy straplocks and I dont see any reason to pay more for the Dunlops A good wellpriced product,positive

Ive been playing guitar for over twenty years now and Ive tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these Elixir coated strings Ive come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it Eventually all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesnt make any sense If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower costFew people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the US and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names Granted Elixir probably isnt one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way In fact you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings at least most people would be able to hear the difference Dont get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique practice getting better cables pickups amps guitars etc than from just using these strings For better string life just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use This discipline once a habit is good enoughPeace Take Good Care of Your Strings and They Will Last Longer,neutral
I recently got myself a Kenny Wayne Shepherd Stratocaster guitar I decided that since the guitar he had a set of tens strings installed I would go with theseThey work flawlesslyThe qualities excellent cannot go wrong with Ernie Ball strings no matter what gauge you get As always excellent quality,positive
This is an extremely versatile pedal I was considering getting a reverb or delay pedal but I decided to go with this instead since its infinitely more flexibleThere are tons of effects Some I might not use but there are plenty I will use New firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects You download the firmware and install via the USB portI use it with a VHT special 6 I have a Fulltone OCD after the Zoom It works nicely with the tube amp whether or not I turn the OCD on The effects sound excellent to me Im now a Zoom fanIf youre lusting after a bunch of effects pedals but only have the cash for one this is a really good option At a minimum youll hopefully figure out the 510 you wont really use without having to shell out the cash for them Great pedal for home studio,positive
This is the answer to your all your power supply needs If you own more than 1 pedal and we all do You need this It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing youll save enough money to pay for it in no time not having to buy batteries Get it youll love it I Excellent,positive
I bought this not knowing what to expect It sounds just like I hear on tv and it sounds great I didnt think that banjo was good until I bought this,positive
This pedal is a great delay pedal works well with my marshallHas a lot of feautures and is very versitale flashback,positive
Okay Color coding is a GREAT ideaDivas will not use the red ball windscreenWhyBecause from a distance it looks like they have a clown noseNo kidding I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech So save your dough buy any color but REDDivas What can I say Color Coding Helps the sound engineer,negative
Ive ordered 9 of these and only one has been defective Not worth shipping it back no big deal Great tuner for my guitar class The Snark may have a few more features but if all you need this to do is help you tune youre good to go Basic Stupid Proof,positive
After using DAddario strings Ive try to Ernie Ball strings I have ten years ago with Ernie Ball strings and let me tell you that its the best strings In comparison with Regular Slinky this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk clasical rock and indie sound I have an Stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres The best strings,positive
Thought Id try this but theres another brand that I prefer Needed to reshift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some Second best,neutral
I cant compare it as others have done with the OCD but it simply gives me an overdrive that I love I have several other OD pedals Tube Screamer LovePedal Kalamazoo and even a cheap Danelectro DS1 The JF02 is truly my favorite right now Ive been using it with a Strat and a Les Paul clone into either a Fender Vibro or a small Bugera V5 It serves up great tones into either one Lovely Tone,positive
Cable crackles when plug in jack is moved GLS brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison Both have tweed jackets however the Hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the GLS cable does I would recommend the GLS product over the Hosa product Does not perform as expected Poor quality,negative
I play bassand have for 40 years One thing Ive come to like a lot about playing music on my instrument is the development of various kinds of sound effects effects pedals etc Laying down a track or musical run of notes then building another one over the top of that and then another and another once was only able to be done in a studio Now with my Boss RC3 I can do it any time I want In rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful I can get a couple of rhythm lines going then have the ability to begin developing a bass lead line to suitor play along to develop my chopswhatever is warranted This pedal like other Boss pedals Ive purchased is made to last longer than you kind of kidding the electronics have been engineered with nothing but precision and control and the pedal will do all the manual says it will Best bet watch a few YouTube videos showing its use by a number of musicians That helps you understand a lotthen like me you can buy one and it will bring you playing pleasure for certain The Product Description was absolutely right,positive
This is a review for theMahalo U30PK Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele PinkFor the price 30 shipped it cant be beat Free shipping via Amazon Prime I got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas and she loves it I taught her the Cchord and I play the Gchord so we play the Moldy Peaches Anyone else but you Its a great little starter musical instrument and a great beater uke that I dont mind getting a bit banged upI was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight well good enough for a cheap uke The strings are some kind of cheap nylon I changed the strings to nylguts and they sound 1000x better almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost The fretboard is painted black so I dont know what kind of wood was used I didnt expect ebony for this price I also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high and now even I can play it without complaining too much It has geared tuners not friction pegsIt even comes with a matching polyester gigbag Now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter Overall a decent playstarter uke and worth the 30 A decent and cheap ukulele for the young and young at heart,positive
I put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer This is the IMDimprovised musical devicesolution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls I plug two cords into the mixer one from each pickup and blend and balance the two pickups It works It cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero Bonus its an active device so it can boost the signal Only con is that it runs on 12 V and doesnt have a battery option I can live with that WorksSimple Device for Simple Job,positive
This tuner looks nice and works great It puts guitars into the best tune It has lasted for over a year and the battery hasnt died yet Some might say it breaks easily but as long as it is dealt with gently there will be no problems Great price great tuner worth the buy Great Price Great Tuner Worth the Buy,positive
I liked these a lot For the price they work very well and I am very happy that I bought them I got a couple of those straightcoupler things but really their use is quite limited because input jack heights on different effects pedals are rarely the same height so you cant use the straightcouplers You dont run into that problem with these they can connect any pedal to any other pedal Work Well Price is Good,positive
Like another reviewer here I too own a Fender GDec 30 BTW now going up for sale The Spider Jam 75W specs are all out there so I wont repeat all that info but give you my users impressions instead First I was fortunate enough to buy one for 300 the same price as the Fender GDec 30 so its an even simpler comparison for meThe Line 6 Spider Jam 75W is a full head shoulders taller and better than the GDecAs just simply an amp it has more power as good of sound As for the rest Ill take line 6s real drums sets and myriad of song backings over the Fenders midisynthe tunes any day The ability to save your custom tunes as JAM or WAV files internally or out to a larger SD card is a godsend and to me the single biggest factor to own this amp over a GDec I use the max 2gb SD note it must be fat 16 formatted is not HC The overdub layering is simply superb though its saved as mono The XLR mike 14 plug aux MP3 inputs allow a great flexibility for total song creation Coupled with my Line 6 Variax guitar I have been able to produce an amazing range of sounds and songsThe only criticisms I can muster are 1 The menu process is more difficult than the GDec but easy enough with handson experience 2 The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough 3 Line six really needs to update to an SDHC format so it can utilize larger than 2gb SD storage cards I have experimented with using a 4GB nonHC SD card though I was able to format it I was not able to read write to it Line 6 please go to SDHC I would also like to see an improvement to an incremented or notched amp model selector pot As every once in a while it will jump from the A or B selection if not exact A GDec convert You can be one too,positive
Great foot rest its not flimsy But its not light weight I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that its there I like that its adjustable to various heights I am short 51 so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when Im playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when Im playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture I shift it over to my right leg I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when Im playing classical and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing Great foot rest I recommend it great foot rest,positive
amazing the bestI cant believe this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout wordsI recommend it thanks behringer amazing the best,positive
does its job just fine simple and kind of cheap looking and its hard to balance if you have it on a rug and not even a thick rugI have a thin rug and it still is unbalanced but hey its not really meant for rugs so I cant complain cheap,neutral
This L Jack is good enough to make connections between my guitar pedals and it works fine Flexible enough I dont like only the fact that its made out of plastic and it looks cheap but for the price i paid for it i dont really care Good,positive
A string winder and cutter This is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times It even has a peg puller for people who have pegs on their acoustic guitars Great quality productI will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly A must for changing strings in a hurry,positive
Use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my older model Gold Tone banjo ukulele Smooth as silk work great as all GROVERS do Great machines,positive
for the price of 1 one saddle at GCyou get 2 of these and the nut assembliesi keep them handy for guitar setup changesordered on Monday arrived on thursday great price,positive
First of all as a former touring guitarist and a guitar tech junkie I have a tool box with every tool you can imagine I have to say this string cleaner is a must have I say this because in the long run it will save you money on strings save you time with changes and will keep your strings sounding aliveMost guitarists dont realize just what they are doing to their strings when they play You are leaving behind a world of sweat dead skin and all kinds of nasty elements The oilsfluids you leave behind can be very acidic and contain plenty of things that will build up and corrode your strings Ive seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead Ive seen mold and and all kinds of garbage build up on strings so bad I thought a sloth may be living on it This little tool will prevent thatI have a routine with mine Before I play I run the cleaner over the strings a few times Whenever Im done playing I make sure to spray a string cleaner fluid onto the pad and run it over the strings again until I feel they are completely clean You will not believe the extension of your string life or the quality of sound you will get following these cleaning practicesSomeone has mentioned in their review the fret damage that the string cleaner caused and I too thought about that the first time I used it I suggest pulling up a little bit so that the cleaner does not touch the frets Toward the nut where it is hard to get the cleaner in I just wipe down with a rag This is a great cheap handy little product that all guitarists should keep in their pockets A must have for every guitarist,positive
I needed good knobs I enjoy them I highly recommend them They will last for a long time and they are a good product Good knobs,positive
I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews I have five guitars including two Les Pauls and they hold them just fine I give them four stars The are fine for I believe all guitars at home but I wouldnt use them for retail or something like a school They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel its just a rivet the holds them together The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke like the other reviewer said you really should find a stud to mount them to but if you must use wall anchors use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall All in all these are sturdy and stable when anchored to a stud and Ill use more if I have the need Good product for the price,positive
Manwhen I saw these things a light came on in my headit was an 34uh duh34 momentNo noise plenty of length and nicely spaced with rightangle plugs for all your standard 9V DC pedalsAny complaints about noise with these cables it just a symptom of something wrong within their setupI had an old wallwart laying around and put it to good useCheck the total amount of amperage draw usually 5001000 milliamps to make sure your wallwart can handle it and daisychain away Works well,positive
I love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones If it is super grundgy clean it with something stronger than followup with this stuff Leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel I usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time Best lemon Oil for your Fretboard,positive
There are lots of ways to tune a guitar ranging from using a tuning fork to sitting next to a properly tuned piano Ive also used a variety of electronic tuners over the years with everything from rows of flashing lights to meters with a needle There are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators metronomes etc built in But this device is simple portable easy to use and just plain works Its also cheap enough that even if you have other types of tuners its worth the money to get one of these for each guitar case Aside from its simplicity its also less bothered by background noise as other units with microphones might be Every guitar case should have one,positive
For the money this mic performs very well It is very sensitive I can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic If you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room I also put a pop filter on it Ive only had it a day so Ill see how it does in the long run Great Microphone,positive
Hangs my guitar around my neck so I dont have to hold it there Easily adjusted Looks nice The pick pocket is handy Good guitar strap,positive
This is nearly identical to theGuardian Cases CG020B Bass Guitar Caseat about half the cost However there are some issues with this case as well as limitationsFirst the issues while the covering appears to be stitched on it is for the most part glued on and if the case is left in a hot unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges On the other hand someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car or garage or other storage space for prolonged periods However you should be aware of the issue if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers imagine the effect on your bassThe limitations are simple the case while a hard shell design is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs but if you have a heavy road schedule and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the bands gear this case will not afford you the protection of an ATAstyle caseAlso note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass so any longscale J or Pstyle basses will fit I cannot be sure about other brands and modelsI mentioned an ATAstyle case as a better solution and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules For less demanding protection I recommend that you also consider this case which I purchased as an upgrade when I became aware of the issues and limitations of the Musicians Gear modelSKB Electric Bass Rectangular Hardshell standard latches handleIf you still opt for the Musicians Gear case you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag A step up from a soft gig bag,neutral
Everything I would want in a gig bag A quality bag for a quality instrument What you see is what you get The truth about this product,positive
I tested in my friend recording studio and work really good trust me for the price it over the top Great for the money,positive
Knowing nothing about guitars except that my husband plays one I got this for my other halfHe was very happy with it said it was an excellent quality capo only needing a turn of knob to do what it needs to do He showed me how it worked how it gives a different sound to the guitar depending on where you position itI would highly recommend this to you guitar players My husband is pretty picky about his guitar stuff and I can assure you he was very satisfied with this capoHighly recommended A From My Husband,positive
Fender guitars are made for tinkering they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws At any given time I have a Fender guitar taken apart and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws I inevitably lose Dont get me wrong I am a diehard Fenderista but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects not fine examples of the luthiers art Thats what makes them so much fun to play and modify Fits like the originals,positive
Bought this for my bass playing step son dont know if he uses it but I loved the green I have two a soprano and tenor Larger cant play for crap but liked the look I almost kept it,positive
Its not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isnt for you If you are looking for a solid easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it wont get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you It works great to hang a standard size guitar on There is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but I am not sure It has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs arent bumped and hangs straight just touching the wall with the body I recommend it Works great as a wall hanger for my fender,positive
These picks R awsome I have tremmors in my hands and have a hard thime with pick controlThey Have a Gell center Whitch tingles It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picksThese picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they sayIf U have hand problems try thesethey really work Love these,positive
This was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on Its easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops I recommend it to all aspiring musicians Quick Connect,positive
The thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference For my style the 60 Dunlop Tortex is perfect The surface is matte and not too slick I dont think I have ever worn one down to being unusable they seem to last forever or until theyre lost Ive tried other brands and picks made of other materials but I always come back to these Ill probably be buried with one in my hand My favorite for over 30 years,positive
Nice pics that work well when you are really jammin on a tune Good product fair price,positive
It does the job though I wasnt impressed by the lack of range but then again Ive never found a use for the more extreme settings on a phaser anyways It seems that this unit keeps the effect within a safe and comfortable range and thats okay with me Doesnt push any envelopes,positive
Just finished setting it up Works perfect Stout stable and even looks good Its holding a Gibson Les Paul so it has to be trustworthy Great price Wayne guitar stand,positive
winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well fast multi tool,positive
Ive been using Shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and I can honestly say that I can hear no audible differences between a genuine Shure SM57 and this GLS Audio ES57This isnt based on any scientific data its based on ABing this mic and a Shure 57 on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre I made sure that I marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amps speaker grill I recorded about 30 seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the Shure mic and then this one When you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good Bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two If you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor Im sure youll see some visual differences but they are also two different performances but my ears really hear nothing audibly different Some may disagree but Im convincedThis mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the Shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and outIs it as good as the Shure I dont know I think so others may not I do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one Shure 57 though Id highly recommend these on guitar cabinets snare drums and toms for sure maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voiceA nobrainer as far as I can tell Better watch out Shure,positive
It was nice to have many types as I had no idea the thickness I would like It also helped my boyfriend decide also Nice variety,positive
For my first gig bag its ok I since then bought a new alvarez acoustic electric which i will be buying a hard case simply because the build quality and protection isnt there in a padded case I have had this padded bag for a year now with light use and edges are starting to tare and rip Also i am concerned that the zippers might get stuck and break at any moment I will be replacing this with a hard cases as soon as i buy one for my alvarez For my first gig bag its ok I since,neutral
I dont know if they are the best havent tried them all but from what Ive tried none are better DAddarios are top quality and very reasonably priced My choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics DAddarios are top notch,positive
Love this little guy I was previously using a Blue USB Snowball This just sounds so much fuller and more real Sounds Great,positive
I like the tone of this one better than the stock one in my Champ and in my Kustom Kontender Also I like it more than the JJ but the difference is subtle The JJ version seems to be a bit brighter and slightly more noise in a good way but not what I want for me love it,positive
Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it Not durable Spend a few more dollars it is worth it Cheap Zippers,negative
I like simple guitar straps without too much glitz and yet wide enough for the shoulder and attractive yet simple Good looking brown leather guitar strap,positive
The box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand The top section with the mic thread attachment was missing Sent it back and did not reorder Received half a stand,negative
Just as the others have said Its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storageIts a perfect fit for Fender Squire J Bass I also got my Samick CR13 short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for Short Scale bassesBut Im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and I would buy it again Cheap but Effective,positive
Absolutely perfect Some other reviewer complained about theirs being blemished but Im guessing they just didnt know to pull off the protective layer Mine was shinynew and was an absolute perfect fit on my MexiStrat The price was the bestanywhereand with free shipping I couldnt be happier Strat pickguard,positive
When you record singing you need this to prevent the pop sound It is definitely worth it It also makes you looks professional You need it,positive
I bought these DAddario strings after going back and forth between 9s and 10s and have really come to like these sizes They keep a nice slinky feel and keep a lot of tone through many hours of playing Im really happy with this DAddario purchase Just perfect for the inbetween 9s and 10s player,positive
I never use slide to play my guitar this is the first I ever have look like good quality I just have to learn how to play Nice quality slide,positive
Has worked very well so far Need to make sure it is extremely quiet area when you tune but has worked well and easy to use Good tuner Easy to read and use,positive
There is such a thing as too much Youll find it in this pedal I have both this and the Boss distortion pedals and prefer the Boss Its a little heavy for my tastes,neutral
As title says1 High Action2 Inadequate Loudness for pickingI compared this to the Mitchell MD100 and think the Mitchell is very good for its priceYou can compare both at guitar center High Action Inadequate Loudness for picking,neutral
This is a decent to good little tuner but there are some drawbacks to it Also I have the otherPlanet Waves Chromatic Headstock Tunerto compare this one to Here are the pros and cons of this tuner as I see themPros Super compact Virtually invisible from the front of the guitar Adjustable frequency settings Top load battery No need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh batteryCons Awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it Less gradation in setting than other tuners The gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuningDebatable Clip mechanism Not spring loaded This means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar One battery This unit takes only one battery versus two with the otherWhen it boils down to it I prefer my old planet waves tuner It seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning using both at the same time and I like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry In fact I can easily recommend that tuner main drawback is that that one eats batteriesThis tuner is more catered to Fenderstyle headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on For those players bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars For others I highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review Compact decent tuner,neutral
Have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time Attaches to my audio interface No cable switching Didnt need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much Fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording Simple mixer works great,positive
I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2s performance most significant where I couldnt record a good sounding signal that wasnt distorted with the Line In jack Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4ns 14 inch jacks it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp adjusting the gain doesnt correct it I contacted Zooms tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviewsI really like the H4ns design the menus and controls are nicely organized It feels more sturdy than the H2 The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent Most other recorders in this price range dont have XLR inputs Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board if the line in jacks dont work properly and cant accept a normal line level signal without clipping I cant use this for what I bought it for I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems Ive worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem If you are using this to record with mics it works great but if you need to record from line level sources the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice I exchanged this for the Tascam DR07 and while the Tascam doesnt have as many bells and whistles It is a nice recorder and Im very happy with it Good recorder with one major flaw,negative
Great deal for the price and very sturdily made Easy to assemble and feels very solid Way cheaper than I saw in Guitar Center Im very pleased with this stand I bought two Great deal,positive
Excellent simple product Fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing Easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end Has grooves on ends and one can slide it down so that at least 2 strings fit into the grooves Very Good Pick Holder,positive
I have 6 amps One of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb It fails to sound right So I researched reverb pedals and found the Biyang RV10 Tri Reverb to be the best in design tone and value on the market I was not wrong Have had this unit for well over a month now and it still is amazing in how it produces just what was lacking with that one amps pitiful excuse for reverbThis device with its three different reverb settings is just right for any style music you play The spring setting is really quite real in how it trails off and that doesnt happen in a digital device Analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce The hall setting is wonderful Rich but not too over powering The AB switch is kinda a nice touch Much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer And the fact that it is stereo both in and out is just icing on the cakeSince it resides on my board I have grown to use it even with amps I have that are built with good reverb Im so acustom to the great sound of the Biyang that I just use it for nearly every amp I own Its that good Biyang has another great one for you,positive
I originally bought several of these cables to use between our DMX light fixtures The day they arrived I happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so I tried one of these The cable is soft and flexible and I could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable I had been using thats a good thing my other cable was very expensiveThe connectors are not gold plated but its an inexpensive cable its not pretending to be anything other than a decent lowcost XLR twoconductor shielded cable Its working for me Ill be buying more for our studio Good and inexpensive Win Win,positive
This thing works wonders If you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot I recommend I hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels and this just is perfect for the job The pedals are all easy to press and I love the volumewah 2in1 pedal I just use it as a volume because I already have a wah pedal The tuner works amazing as well I also love the fact that it connects to your amp via RJ45 ethernet cable I love this thing,positive
