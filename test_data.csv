Doesnt color the sound depending on how youre using it you can push the channel or get an extra channel Ive turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy Does exactley what it should,positive
This tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a reasonably priced product As with any tool there is a small learning curve just to become familiar with the way it functions After using it a couple of times I can only give it high marks It simply works,positive
Whats great about the Dunlop designThey work The only thing you need to do is ensure youve got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar ie just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rearend off without worryThe design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move aroundrotate on the post which is exactly what you want The schaller ones see below have a major flaw in them from my familys experience We will never run anything other than this design going forwardWhat doesnt work with the Schaller DesignOur family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shallerstyle locks for a while now Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American PBassnot good My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend The problem with the design is theres a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab thats screwed into the body unscrewing itself Weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenonWe tried to make the Shallers work but just could not Maybe were all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us Vastly Superior DesignFunction compared to Schaller Style,positive
Unit works fine with my digital piano Its light portable and fairly sturdy The price is right for what you get Good Value,positive
Not as good as the headstock tuner I purchased I used it a few times It can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic I wouldnt buy another one Its okay,neutral
I got a few of these as a Christmas gift and theyre just bad I put them on my pedalboard where I previously had longer cables and these just didnt stay in the jack I have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these If I play loudly and my room vibrates a bit the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal Awful Doesnt cut it for me,negative
Have to try them more and with other amps By now they work really good and no interference where detectedat least by my ears What I like is that they last a lot these are the second planet waves cables that I own and the first ones are still in great conditions So fargood,positive
Works well even with a room full of noiseplus its easy to see These are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a Guitar or Uke Great,positive
Good grippy picks for some types of playing I go back and forth between these and the Jazz IIIs when Im in a Jazz pick kind of mood ie when Im not using ginormous Gypsy Jazz picks or Fender heavies I especially dig Davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming Nice tone as well Have tried pretty much every Dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playingOne thing about Davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip and Ill pick the string with the rubber Hand angle can also play a part in this Probably just me After picking packs of picks I picked the Dava Jazz Grips,positive
I looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one I hesitated a bit because I couldnt find anywhere that they specified the width but it was a good price so I took a chance Its about one and a half inches wide by the way Im very happy with it and I like that it has the flexibility to attach one end to either the headstock or a button I cant think of any negatives its a nice functional nonflashy strap that does its job well and its wide enough that it doesnt feel like its digging into my shoulder I looked at a lot of different straps,positive
Really great sounding harmonica Beautiful sound and very well made Very happy with this product and the price is incredible Great product,positive
Tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available These are basically the same as Schaller strap locks They cost less money and I think the parts are interchangeable It is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer disclaimer I know that the Fender buttons will work in the Schaller strap portion of the lock Best Strap Lock,positive
I tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised I tend to have sweaty hands and my guitar strings get a lot of crud on them and then eventually rust Although I have learned now to wipe them down each time I play they still deteriorate pretty quickly and its a pain When I wipe them down with a cloth they leave black streaks of crud on the clothThe Elixirs are not as bright as other strings when you first put them on that is true However other strings lose their brightness after just a few hours of playing so I dont see this as a major disadvantage The advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them When I wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth Ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefullySo for a player like me these are a godsend I dont detect any loss of tone They are a bit slippery and some people have reported having trouble because of this but its fine for meDefinitely theyre worth a try Although theyre twice as expensive as regular strings theyll last longer so theyre worth checking out Ernie Ball makes titanium coated strings that Im interested in trying out and there are some other brands too Great for sweatyhanded players like me,positive
This mic stand is solid and a good value but its a one trick pony The picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect the stand comes with 5834 threads and does not come with an adapter Not a huge deal if youre using a standard mic clipThe height is about 4534 inches total and Im using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port If you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop Id highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from On Stage I have one of those too but it was too tall even at its shortest setting to mic my drum port but the adjustable height is very handy Good but limited functionality,neutral
I initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding I was wrong They have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal I have a Schecter Hellraiser with EMG X Series pickups and they go great with them They are easier to bend too which is great I no longer use heavier strings like I use too These will be my mainstay Best strings I have used for metal,positive
After reading a bunch of reviews about this product i was not sure about buying it but i give it a try and i am completely satisfy it doesnt ad noise to my pedal chain i use it with a radioshack power supply 9v 25 A and a can tell that not a sound came from electric issuesIm not saying that it is better than a voodoo lab power brick but for me work perfect and i dont see why not taking it out for Gigs Great Deal 4 Me,positive
It is OK but it does not compare to the ergo holderWhich you may find hereDunlop Ergo PickholderThe main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out and it is extremely fragile No Bueno,negative
Clear amazing cable VERY UNDERRATED incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall Very underrated cable,positive
I use this to power a Big Muff Pi mxr compresser Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Planet Waves tuner pedal The only pedal I have that it wont power is a digitech whammy but that was expected when I bought it It works great I use the 9volt battery adapter to power the Big Muff and it even works perfect I get no extra hum with the 4 pedals and it only takes up one spot in my surge protector Great little power source Im not sure Id use it for professional gigs but great for home use Great multipedal power source,positive
This is fine for my music room at home where it isnt likely to get bumped too hard I wish the bottom didnt swivel because I dont see a need for it to do that But it keeps my guitar handy and does the job I wanted it to do at a low price I like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out However I wouldnt recommend this for the stage where there are crowded conditions and it is more likely to suffer a heavy bump For that you would want a larger tripod at the bottom to make it less likely to topple Works fine and price is good but I wouldnt recommend it for the stage,positive
Works like a charm Powers up to five 9V effects using one power supply I am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly No more dead 9V batteries Some effects eat 9V batteries like a 6 year old with a cone of cotton candy 5 plugs 1 power sourcethis is a good thing,positive
I havent used this yet but it seems solid and idiot proof just like I need Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick Very good price seems nice,positive
Comes in a really nice case Works great Great price Very light Cant speak to durability because havent had them long and havent used them heavily I have to cases,positive
Good cheap strings for guitar Hard to beat the price I am not an expert on guitar strings So I hope that helps Good cheap strings,positive
Picked up some Blue Steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone Also was the last to pick it up for 11850 shipped to my door If you like a parlor guitar this might be for you The case is kick ass too easily a 50 valueUpdate After putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner along with putting on new strings this guitar rocks Putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone This is my goto guitar Sounds good and has great intonation The only foreseeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning I have a washburn D30 and love this just as much for 13 the cost Super nice,positive
Does what it says I live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do this is obviously higher quality Well made a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one Nice product,positive
They sent me the 1mm Blue by mistake but it turns out I prefer that size after testing it out Fast shipping I play bass rockmetal Great for Bass,positive
Great mount for the price Filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup Quality good especially given fairly low price Works very well filter great,positive
This acessorie is well builded and dont change the guitars pitch No damages guitars neck Its so easy to use Great Guitar Capo,positive
Works a little better at winding strings than the barebones winders The string cutter is very handy The pin puller as is usually the case is a little clumsy to use but it works Nice gadget,positive
great price for good mike I did not want to spend a lot to start I got a good mike at a great price 50 good mike great price,positive
Without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my 7pedal guitar effect lineupNo noticeable hiss hum or buzzing Clean quietGood buy for the price Good price Does the job,positive
I have many heavy guitars Yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers Im neither However my back was still hurting and Im definitely a weakling So I bought this shoulder pad Now I only look like a weakling to the more eagleeyed people who see me play guitar Thanks Planet WavesReally though its quite good Ow my back,positive
I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantasticEasy to use and very accurate It makes tuning a breeze Super Tuner,positive
I like them but these strings are probably not for everyone The EXP16s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallowbodied Ovation However I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite differentWhile I was not expecting it my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be and they are amazingly easy on the fingersThe only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that while giving once on the guitar they are a little brittle off the guitar I almost snapped my E getting it set up Other than that the strings are just a little squeaky I personally like a little squeak but at the current price point I dont think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who dont Good strings good price,positive
I love the dual bulb design The clamp slid around a bit on my music stand Overall I like the design and flexibility Accidental turnon in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem Im sure Ill need to find a way to protect the product from breaking since it seems like it would not stand a chance on its own in my gig bag nice light but not perfect,positive
For the price it serves as a good resting place for the guitar when not being played Well designed and useful Very utilitarian,positive
I write and record my own music I use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar I replaced the cable that came with it with a Mogami and it sounds great Crystal clear and it doesnt color the recordings It will pick up ambient noise from the front but thats to be expected It does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back Be sure to get a pop filter to go with it Great microphone for vocals,positive
works great and to me its cheap cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cableHighly recomended good,positive
This Levys Jacquard strap is well made and comfortable It was much cheaper here than any other place online or at a brick and mortar Arrived quite quickly but a tracking number wouldve been nice Otherwise no compaints Great Strap,positive
These mic stands worked perfectly The fold down pretty small so you could fit a couple of them in most travel bags Easy to adjust Good Mic Stands,positive
Tried it didnt like it returned it Just not my cup of tone thats all I have more use for an overdrive Not for me,neutral
I use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp which is in a soundproof box The cord is reliable and clean sounding I like it and have used HOSA products in the past with confidence Excellent cord Hopefully this review will be usefull to you great affordable cord,positive
I purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin Decent rosin for beginner,positive
This is a hitormiss product For me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well Its not a total loss since I can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution I ended up with It was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on Not as good as Id hoped,negative
These strings fit the Bill perfectly for MY desired sound from a Yamaha LJ16 Acoustic Guitar which has been Doctored with Bone Saddle Pins and nut When I decided to put the money into the guitar it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ16 and after all the work was completedthat proved to be true to form I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and its a most outstanding sound from a medium price hand crafted guitar Elixir has the best most comfortable feel to me of all the strings that Ive tested and these provide the best for my liking sound on this guitar Try them if its quality sound that youre looking forThese are great Super Buy,positive
It does what I need to get my bass and guitar to the amp Probablly not much use being only five feet in length for a gig or show but since I am only rocking out in my house its no big deal 5ft cable,positive
This stand was very inexpensive and I thought I could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my Epi Sheraton II Unfortunately I am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand It seems to be built well enough for what it is but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards Also for leftright stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems tippyThe construction itself is ok The rubber tips on the feet seem fine but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short The body cradle is nicely padded but isnt firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design it just isnt all that solid You can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece It ships with an unsightly white UPC sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstageGranted the Sheraton II is a large and heavy guitar but the OnStage is billed as Heavy Duty and to me that means SOLID which this stand just isnt at least with larger guitars or basses When you use a guitar stand you cant afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihoodBottom line you get what you pay for For smaller lighter guitars Strats and such it may be ok but for Dots Sheratons 335s and larger Gretchs I just wouldnt trust it and that goes for most basses as wellI will need to look for something else Unsuitable for larger guitarsbasses,neutral
Elixir strings are great for me They hold their tones longer They arent rough textured so they are easier on the fingers Elixirlight,positive
This isnt a terrible tuner and for how cheap it was it wasnt a ripoff However it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim When it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner However almost all of the time its fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing I try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and its the same It also did not come with batteries and replacement ones arent cheap and are very hard to find I dont think this is a terrible product due to the low price but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously get a real desktop tuner A cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find REAL full sized affordable batteries for it I dont know why people are raving,negative
high end pick felt comfortable even with its larger size took awhile to get used to but really liked it nice stuff,positive
Good Strings I buy this Strings from a few years and i love them I like them with my Gibson LP but also with my other guitar with the Floyd They are durable and a really good sound for my Funky Rock Type of music i like Good,positive
I had to get used to this tuner at first I have used a different brand up until this purchase An experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me Glad he did the price is way affordable on this site and its really easy to use Great Guitar Tuner,positive
I use this to practice at my computer to keep from disturbing my wife when she is studying or my daughter when she is sleeping Great little box Perfect for practice,positive
Made of leather or highquality pleather so it seems builttolast I use it on my Seagull and it totally works great I would definitely recommend but its kind of expensive for what it is Does exactly what it looks like itll do,positive
It is okay It serves the purpose It is a good fit for the soprano uke A pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week Not a big deal I just stuck a zip tie in its place The case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it It has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear There is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case It will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty but will not provide much more protection than that Serves the purpose,neutral
This capo is expensive The first time I and everybody else saw one I said Wow I can get a Kyser or something for fifteen bucks Get out of hereFive capos later I realize that I could probably have just shelled out the money instead of purchasing every other capo on the market one at a time over the last fifteen yearsThe first and last thing that really needs to be said about the G7th is this it doesnt put my guitar out of tune Virtually at all I can capo all the way up to the seventh or eighth fret and my microsensitive tuner shows that Im still within one glowing light of being perfectly on Thats it Yes the G7th is sleek and beautiful like a tiny sculpture and glorious to look at and sometimes I just want to stare at it Yes its easy to put on just a mere squeeze of the hand away from being perfectly in place Yes it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants But the tuning thing is all that really sets one capo apart from another at the end of the day and this one kills itI own three Shubbs a Kyser a Dunlop and one of those rolling capos Theyre all good I dont hate any of them But this capo takes away all the uncertainty and irritation of being a fraction out of tune with the rest of the band or with myself It makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy Everybody go home G7th won the capo game,positive
This strap is pretty thin Not like some of the other for the same price that I have purchased on Amazon Still does its job but well see how the quality is after a while Not really thought it was going to be this cheap,neutral
I have never played a string instrument and it looks like Ill be able to get the hang of this very quickly Only problem is the strings Sting one plays 34dead34 meaning it will not stay intune Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem Have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon Very Neat package,positive
A bit heavy and doesnt fold up to be very compact but its not like there are any better options out there so Would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but Seems pretty sturdy and like a good buy for the price,positive
Seems to be made well length was perfect for my application and there have been no problems with functionality or connectivity using the cable These make great and affordable mic cables Not much else to say it works and looks well made Definitely recommend it cable does a good job well made,positive
I rated it at 5 stars because 5 stars means 34I Love it34 in Amazons selection of things I do love it In fact I think it is better than my Sans Amp Bass DI which costs more Dont get me wrong the Sans Amp is still great I just find this easier to dial in it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp The only down side is that it doesnt come with an AC power adapter That isnt a problem for me since I have many power options on my pedal boards This takes the standard negative polarity center like Boss pedalsIf you have been playing bass for a while you know that no matter how good your bass rig is you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your ampthat being saidI am in my 50s and I play mostly guitar hero music like Robin Trower SRV Hendrix Yes Rush and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc the fun old rock n roll stuffLike the Sans Amp putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better You can easily get the live Chris Squier or Geddy Lee sound The older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple The tone that I love to dial in is that old 3 piece rock band sound from years past Think of Mel from Grand Funk Railroad or old James Gang in the Joe Walsh Days Johnny winter and the Cream that over driven cranked Ampeg or Fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a 3 piece power bandI am running this into an Ampeg Bass combo and I have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous Playing bass is a side gig for me since I am mainly a lead guitarist I let my bassist try it he also uses a Sans Amp Bass DI at our gigs and he immediately went online and purchased oneHe is another cool use for this pedal If you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp The punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible Try it Hartke VXL Bass Attack,positive
I used it once will only use it when Im in front of it so that no one takes it it works great when youre using your tablet and I use it for playing Pandora when playing in clubs It not Djing its DJ sound without the DJ no offends DJ your job isnt easy but when their isnt a DJ this helps Remember to have Wifi in order to connect to Panadora ffsalsayahoocom,positive
it is an excellent backup capo I dont feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job I use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings OK for the price,neutral
just arrived in good shape Polish w an expansive polishing cloth Almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths axe polish cloth,positive
This strap works fine for my acoustic using the leather laces to tie around the neck of the guitar I didnt like it so much for my electric guitar because I was nervous that it would come loose since the leather 34buttonholes are somewhat wimpy If you have a heavy electric guitar I recommend that you buy a locking guitar strap or something with thicker leather It would have been better if it had a felt backing or at least an adjustable pad Works great for my acoustic guitar but I wish it had a felt or padded back,positive
These snark tuners are really coolThis SN8 model comes this a metronome and also you can scale updown with buttons for when using a capohighly recommended Nice and convenient,positive
Great for videophoto work or even theater It wont handle well at a large space If you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situationWhat Ill be using it forDj work to show laser beams and light beamsVideo work use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site thats what you are seeing in moviesPhoto work not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an ISO Moviemakerssmallmedium location friendly,neutral
Capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary This one has a very strong spring so I am hoping i lossens up with use Ok,neutral
Playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings Ive preferred just to strum using my fingers because traditional plastic picks are just too harsh and loud Even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dustshedding they doThe Wedgie is EXACTLY what Ive been looking for Harder than my thumb softer than plastic or felt the 31mm Hard Rubber Wedgie is the Goldilocks pick right in the butter zoneI tried the Soft and Medium Wedgies but both were just too soft The Soft Wedgie overgrabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone The Medium is better but is still too dull and the action is a bit too softBut the Hard Wedgie is the clear winner I get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon stringsThe only negatives Ive found are1 They can leave skid marks on your pick guard No big deal as it wipes right off2 They break down faster than Id like Of course that could just be my expectationsStill if youre looking a softerthanplastic pick this is the one to get No pick noise just strings I couldnt be happier Great for Ukulele Acoustic Guitar Players,positive
I first used the Snark when I borrowed a friends before a show and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world He used it to tune his acoustic electric and at first I thought it was working off of sound but then I put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric and it picked it up instantly and tuned it perfectly I couldnt beleive it I had to have one I ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning and vibration tuning as well has having the tap beat metronome and I am in love with it Its SO sensitive and so accurate you can turn the mic off and use it to tune your electric guitar in a VERY loud room and it wont pick up ambient noises LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT I recommend this to ALL musicians The mic feature would be useful on your music stand or attached to your trumpet tuba saxophone whatever clamp it on and play Absolutely awesome Amazing Tuner,positive
I like the fact that it can be 34partially34 installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole which will have to be enlarged a bit Either way once plugged in it sounds great This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a Blueridge BR160 I installed some Fishman 34under the saddle34 pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good if not better If you dont mind the pickup visible in the sound hole this is the way to go Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar Excellent product,positive
I am normally a guitarist in my band but I have found myself at times needing to play the keys also Having two instruments to play a pedalboard and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage so this adapter made things MUCH better for me when I find myself back in that position Works great with my On Stage Keyboard Stand If you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must Worth every penny Excellent,positive
Ive used both the ES57 and ES58 for several years now They are a fantastic mic great quality and construction I love how hefty they are Ive got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed I would probably suggest a higher end if you were studio recording but I set up for live sound in and outdoors and these work great I have several brands some more expensive but I always come back to GLS Great Mic for the price,positive
I like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for and it works well for most of my Ibanez MXR and Boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket It doesnt seem to work so well with my Vox wah my old MXR Distortion Plus and my Fulltone pedals Im using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my Dist and I get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain and intermittant operating problems with the Dist I get a slightly louder hum from the Fulltone pedals when theyre on but my newer BossIbanezMXR pedals have no issues at all The One Spot is not a regulated power supply if it was theyd say so so maybe thats the culprit not sure Your results may vary,neutral
Use this for my desk mic at home It hold my mic right where I want it and doesnt move from where I place it Worth every penny and then some Holds Its Own,positive
Mic Stands can be a hassle sometimes This is not one of those Always works Adjusts easy Holds in Place Great all black look Built to last and great price as well Great Product,positive
Hands down the best cables for electric guitar Ive tried other brands that cost almost if not similar to these and none can match in the quality that prolink presents These are not only the best in delivering tone but theyre durable I bought mine back in 2004 and theyre still working as well as the day I got them today on September of 2012 I bought some planetwaves cables for 40 that didnt even last me 2 years premium quality,positive
This is a good looking strap Much lighter and thinner then any strap that I have had It has to be half the weight of others but that makes it very comfortableLooks great on my blond TeleThe price is right as wellI like it Good looking Strap,positive
got a cleanerpolishwax type ointment for every part of your guitar comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad dealthe fret pad is great and I didnt know about this type of thing till getting this kit also comes with a step by stepstage by stage instruction pamphlet worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed nice,positive
So while I got this for my soprano ukulele they fit fine Not much to say really other then they are good strings and work New strings,positive
I am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings They have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly Good enough,positive
I have always had trouble holding onto picks My fingers just couldnt do it for extended play Nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body LOL I wish I would have thought of these They were just what I needed They work great just what I needed,positive
Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder this is very handled always forget were my pick got off too now I know my Picks is in the holder I Love It,positive
Not very substantial It began to tear on my guitar strings I was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses Not what I expected,negative
It was recomended that I get new strings when I bought my violin and these worked great They are steel coiled so they were fine with my electric violin but did take some time to stretch a bit to hold a tuning which was a bit discouraging at first Theyve been great since Great Idea,positive
This strap is very comfortable Love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar It does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time I put it on but is so worth the final result Love it,positive
Who would have thought you could buy quality bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDsThe strings are with out a doubt real Fender strings And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparablypriced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music storeButBecause you dont have the opportunity to compare strings I do recommend that you know what you wantIve also purchased top shelf guitar stings as well as a variety of other products from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service Fender Bass guitar strings,positive
I should have read the reviews carefully its definitely something different but not sturdy at all rubber bits come off as you strum and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers Ouch Im much happier with my Friday the 13th glowinthedark picks that is an experiment that workedAnd who cares about hard pick sounds anyway If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming why dont you use8230 your fingers Overselling,negative
A long time Planet Waves user I trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards IMHO it is notThe plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar and into the amp at the other end The actual cable is horrible it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should eg like my old Planet Waves cables do They claim that the shielding is excellent but I find it to be mediocre Very disappointing purchase Disapointed in Planet Waves,neutral
Material is similar to my messenger bags strap Reasonably comfortable but I dont want it cutting into my neck Does not go short enough for one of my smaller ukes a rubber band or spare capo is enough to fix that Basic strap holds instruments up,positive
Very comfortable bench Its wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use It feels heavy duty and stays still during use Sturdy comfortable great price,positive
These are nice strap locks but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose This can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut Otherwise these are a good value with easy on off Nice strap locks but,positive
WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic I am a beginner guitar player but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers Excellent,positive

Im a seasoned player of almost 10 years I have owed a 300 dollar martin soprano uke which I had to sell in a time of need for rent money Ive been sad ever since Im in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play I just got this uke today Now aesthetically this uke isnt as pleasing as say a martin sorpanobut it sounds amazing for the price nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too I have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation This ukes sound is at least as good as a 50100 dollar uke seriously impressed I see they make a mahogany version i think du200 which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone I may get one in the future its only 4050 bucks on here amazing anyway this uke is 29 bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated tooI see some people complaining about the stringsand how it goes out of tune fastwhen i got my martin soprano which wasnt cheap it did the same thing best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long timeAnyway this diamond head DU150 soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played Its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists excellent would recommend this brand to anyone Excellent sound for the price,positive
First let me say im using this for a BASS at least for this review and nothing else That said I LOVEBehringer products that I own This guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weakas comparedwith other chorus I have such as ARTZOOMPEAVEYLINE6Gibson Or we could say in a more positive phrasevery subtle The stereo effect for me was nonexistant BUT realize I bought this item over buying a normalABY switch Doing so saved me a bundle but in the long run I will pay for it There is a high cycle hum in the backgroundwhich almost ALL chorus units end up having But I can say it did the job as far as splitting a signal into 2 amplifierheads and doesnt seem to have a problem with the signal being delivered note if you plan on using a 9volt dc adapteryou have laying around in yer gearscrap bucket think againwont work I tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no availall that said I still gota give the item its dueNegatives the unit is made out of plastic and you will have to take it easy when engaging onoff I had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on It was due to the fact it just has a small strip of rubber that is supposed to engage with the buttonswitch on the electronics board you may have to put something behind it or replace it behringer stereo chorus pedal,neutral
This is a very good strap lock system i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap recommended vey good strap lock,positive
This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe If you dont overfill it will not drip and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge Very Easy to Use NonMessy,positive

Look no furtherYou will not be let down by the build quality of these cables nor by the sound quality I have a Monster M ROCK12 cable Put up against these I fail to distinguish the difference in sound The only difference Price These cables are the ONLY cable I will ever use from now on Go ahead buy them You will love them You want great cables,positive
these picks are bigger than i expected easy to hold and very soft they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks nice warm muted kind of sound,positive
4 stars because Ive only used it in stereo mode and Stamina mode Stamina Mode is supposed to run for 11 hours Perhaps it does but if so it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode No one records 11 hours straight so Im guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner If not for that Id have rated 4 stars In terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent The Auto Rec level is very smooth and doesnt sound as if has been severely limited and squashed At rehearsals before the whole band kicks in the levels are quite loud but it comes down quickly and smoothly In terms of the other features I cannot comment Excellent Clarity Flat Response and Transparency,positive
hey rockers DONT HESITATE BUY IT bEHRINGER IS A GREAT EFFECT IT IS MADE IN GERMANY THAT SHOULD EXPLAIN ITS ENGINEERING THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IS PLASTIC BUT DONT LET THAT FULL UR EAR THE effects put out same as some of the older brands i trust Behringer i get more in tone and sound then what i payed for 100 this chorus is a wonderful effect and has a lot of color to the tone this effect is made well with thought behind it and versatility as well i say buy it iv been using all kinds of brand effects and at the end of the day like everything else you pay for the name and some times what u get may not value its name thats why behringer proves that with its effects ,positive
I love my MXL 2010 microphone for its versatility warmth in capturing the voice and build quality Most reviews Ive read of MXL microphones have always emphasized its clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments The MXL Studio 24 aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface It keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable In short the MXL Studio 24 has an excellent build stand microphone easy to use software and clear recording capabilitiesFeatures1 22mm Condenser Capsule not very big but will suit most people2 Cardioid pattern I recommend also looking at microphones with figure 8 and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better3 Zero Latency monitoring a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have4 Frequency response 20 Hz 20 kHz My MXL 2010 has a 30Hz 20kHz The 30hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows5 Output 18 headphone jack USB audio6 High pass filter 120Hz 235Hz 465Hz software controlled7 Lightweight 340gThoughts Very impressive build Its built like a rock has a very fine finish The grill and the frame around the grill are solid I was surprised at how heavy the base was It has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place Its not some cheap plastic The recording capability is parallel to my experience with myMXL 2010 Multipattern Studio Mic The clarity and power isnt nearly as good as the MXL 2010 but is certainly close Using an USB interface a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more With USB its a bit more set for you but that may suit some people perfectly If you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software this is a solid option Easy to use Plug it in via USB and you literally on your way The software installation is optional The microphone works without it Windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccupsSummaryThe MXL Studio 24 USB microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build There are certainly cheaper USB condenser microphones but not many compare to the build and durability of MXL products like this one To me the fairly luxurious price of the MXL 24 is justified with its excellent build clear recording and the ease of use If youre not too sure about getting this USB condenser microphone or any USB microphone for that matter I recommend getting a condenser microphone nonUSB and plugging that in via USB interface If you need any guidance at all with that process Im more than willing to help out Cheers Review of MXL Studio 24 Coming from a MXL 2010 owner,positive

This is a pretty nice and well built lite weight guitar stand but I have another that is a bit nicer and I paid about the same for both This particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar nice,positive
The locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat They went on easily but I noticed they are staggeered so make sure the the taller tuners begin at the low E After the install I stringed it up and played for a couple of hours Cosmetically they do look cool and functionally which of course is the purpose they keep it in tune I am not a big trem guy but when I use it I do not now have to worry about its tuning Great,positive
Tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially Little harder to read than I would have liked especially in sunlight It would be nice if there was a sound feature One other thing that I had in mind so Ill say it here the people that purchase these should put out a Model that Says BLUEGRASS and this blue tuner would be an even bigger hit Good tuner but a little small,neutral
Pricey as far as strings go A lot of people swear by them but I get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less Underwhelmed,neutral
This mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a SM57 I liked what it did to live vocals vs an old mic I have that seemed to give everyone small shocks and probably cost way more in the day I originally bought this to check the hype out and can say that I will likely get more as needed instead of buying SM57s I have not recorded with this yet but from what I heard online I think it will do just fine Sounds really nice,positive
I purchased this sometime around September and when I received it I tested it and it seemed to work correctly Ive had no trouble with it that I can rememberthink of PylePro Moving Coil Dynamic Microphone,positive
great case didnt really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about holds my seagal s6 very well great guitar by the way for the price but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy the padding is done very well great case,positive

Quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather Does exactly what its says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price Brilliant strap,positive
Straplocks have been around for a long time but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well This dual design sold me on itEasy to install on the guitar A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap still only took about ten minutes to do The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isnt going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item Dont know why I put off getting this,positive
I really like the Cherub pickup It is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup Ive used The sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups I have The pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only 8 feet long but for 8 bucks it cant be beat Cherub Good,positive
This bag is super cheap and flimsy with almost no protection for your guitars at all but since its reflected in the cost Cheap thin bag,neutral
If you are looking to spend not too much on a distortion pedal in my opinion this is the one to get There are a few more different models and brands that are good But i could use this pedal no matter what style of music im playing and not feel like i have to sell it if i start a new project Best under 100,positive
Well I dont really know what else to say I ordered them for the guitar Though I wont be using them for the banjo I prefer the sound of clawhammer banjoThe thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put They feel kind of alien right now as its the first time Ive ever wore finger picks but Ill get used to them eventually P They fit my fingers almost perfectly,positive
run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer windows 7 didnt need to install any driversit was plug n play reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record I will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca 222 into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting I found that others had the same issue I had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer click recording devices select my uca222 not internal microphone from the listclick properties at the bottom of the Sound window select the levels tab and reduce the level to around 2 or 3 to have an equal volume from themixer into windows 7 and Reaper Until i did that every signal into Reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothingI tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problemSo far the behringer uca 222 is working great and signal is clean works great,positive
People tell you you need to buy a 1000 dollar tube amp to sound goodshuuut upmic this through a PA and youre set never need another amp againUse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tonesfor 100 bucksSpend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need Ignore GEAR SNOBS,positive
The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes I dont like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound This cable is complete garbage Never again Waste of Money,negative
I wish I bought longer cables but these cables are fine They do what they are supposed to do but I know I can spend a few more dollar dollar bills and get a higher quality cable but the tonal difference wouldnt be anything significant God Enough,neutral
a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item if you are a truly music chosen one very nice and functional,positive
This is accurate and can be used for many different purposes It is durable and can be used while playing I use it for guitar bass uke,positive
Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups these DAddario strings are good strings for all around use They are suitable for rock punk country and funk Sure you could spend more on boutique specialty strings to give you that exact vintage sound but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom garage or clubI like the light guage 010s because they are easy on the fingers but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding 009s and 008s Good all around strings,positive
love the on and off switch and the sound is great with little or no feedback would purchase this mic again Great Mic for the price,positive
Ive had one of these for about 20 years have gigged with it extensively and Ive only had to replace it once more on that laterIm not really a corksniffer re guitar tone I think most of our tone comes from our fingers and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me I think this Monster cable sounds fine Better Well better than what I dont really notice a difference when I use different cables Maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies but its so slight as to be negligibleI look for guitar cables that will last Thats what I really care about and so far this Monster cable does the trick I use other brands too this is my most expensive cable but I think it was worth the 40 I spent all those years agoOh and the return process This was maybe 10 years ago I called Monster they gave me their address and I had to pay about 3 to ship it back to them About 2 weeks later I had a new cable I consider that to be excellent customer service Good cable,positive
I bought these through Amazon about a year ago and have installed them on all of my guitars I have both the nickel and black on heavy basses and they have never let me down I have since installed them on an electric and acoustic guitar out of convenience and purpose The locks work great and give you an added sense of securityThe reviews of the locks speak for themselves and no matter what style of guitar whether its a Les Paul strat or active bass I would strongly suggest them I have never used the Dunlop locks but have heard that some Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls have mounting holes more suited for DunlopsOne thing to note is that all of these come with their own longer screws to use if needed I never had to use them but they are a nice touch and ended up in the parts bin Wouldnt use a strap without them,positive
This product has turned out to be great with few exceptions It comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three not true The license included only works for one amp the AC box combo and not the other two you need to purchase the license for them Plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor You cannot run the output through your sound card to your PC speakers due to latency You must use the headphone jack on the interface In addition if you are in an austere environment and cant get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work Once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product Great product,positive
This pedal solved my problem with my amp After 13 years of messing about with my Mesa Boogie realizing the the California sound is not what I truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a Marshall or VOX this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a Marshall or VOX One can say all kinds of things about quality but for 3100 it made me even more versatile It needs to be in front of a tube amp It needs to be in front of a good tube amp,positive
Ive used the 60mm and 73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career I rock hard Acoustic electric and Bass Ive tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily Dunlops Nylon picks dont break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs youll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming Maybe 5 times in my entire career Buy these picks Best picks on Earth Flexible indestructable,positive
received in just a few daysto a beginner like me they like like good strings but what do I know very fast,positive
Ive had these on my Yamaha APX500 for a while now and they sound really good A tad brighter than I like but thats just the nature of the lightness of the strings Its real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings I try In fact Ive had these strings on for over 4 months now and they still feel and sound good Awesome strings,positive
I liked this tuner the look the size the ease of use the quality performance until it died I think what happened is I just left it on too long My problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it Since it died that first time it doesnt seem to perform the same I also havent really paid much attention to it since it died because I sent another similar tuner in for replacement and I got an acoustic guitar that has an onboard tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitarI wouldnt recommend against this product Just remember to hold the power button to turn it off Battery Problems,neutral
Within just three seconds of using the ElectroHarmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal I knew it was a winner It delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultraeasy to use Although it doesnt have a tone dial it doesnt need one And I say that after trying it through a small tube amp 15w a small digital amp 40w a guitar with humbuckers and a guitar with singlecoil pickups The closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the onoff switch As its name suggests this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be scooped It has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great Fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain The pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus I bought this after watching a professionallooking YouTube demonstration of it It more than lived up to my expectations If I lost this box Id immediately order another one I have zero regrets AMAZINGLY GOOD,positive
This is a well made table top stand The weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease I would get this stand again Great stand,positive
Great flatwound strings I put these on my Jbass over a year ago and they still sound and feel awesome They are stainless steel and very smooth I have never tried other flats except for chromes on my Tele and Fender tapewounds on my fretless so my view may be biased For what I paid and how they sound feel and have lasted I am very pleased Great Strings,positive

Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar EbonyHello again I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now its been over a year and I still stand by my positive review I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesnt have the cost associated with a Gibson Whats also amazing is that its still around a 150 Its well worth the noney It stays in tune and it high quality Well worth the money I just purchased an electricacoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor I will review that later If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about 250 so dont let the name fool you Its still a very nice guitar though Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners I highly recommend this guitar Buy it Thank you Wellmade plays well,positive
but for a small woman with small hands its difficult to operate It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings which cant be good for them I ordered a Schubb brand capo thats much easier to operate and doesnt smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable The only drawback to the Schubb is you cant clip it to the headstock a convenience thats important to a lot of professional musicians Im keeping both if I need the convenience of this clip on style Ill use it When playing at home Ill use the more gentle Schubb It works,neutral
I really wanted this to be a great product The screws strip out too easily Basically if you put a microphone in it and ever have to use it for a microphone it is going to strip out I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon Nope Even the pop filter fell off I LOVE the design but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage ex adjusting the position of the mic picking up a mic stand and moving it etc Otherwise dont have an adjustable tilt option Just make it one solid piece Im tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design Its just not strong enough Not that its a surprise though Not much of anything is worth the money these days Its a damn chore to return every friggin purchase these days that they dont really have to care about actually testing products Why should they They already have your money I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent unboxing and packing things back up Besides what are they going to do Replace it with another broke a product Better yet refund my money for the product I paid minus shipping That doesnt include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place I want a refund plus an hourly wage Whatever dont buy one Companies that dont test their products dont deserve your business What would make me happy is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the questions Did you test this product How did you test it What were your results Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidenceNope Another loser company producing a broke product they didnt test,negative
I cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after I received the product The cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator The fretboard turned out nicely though so I decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3 I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isnt a bad buy Just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one It works as advertised,positive
I got this for use with the Boss DD20 as a taptempo It does the job well its a little big for what it is but definitely worth having with a delay pedal Does what its supposed to,positive
Very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth Big and wide enough to handle any guitar Works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish Works great for cleaning guitar,positive
Ive been using this amp for a few months and Im very pleased with the overall quality and performance I was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on YouTube I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it I only use the clean side or input one This is what Fender calls Blaceface Clean No matter how hard you push that channel it wont break up and sounds great with no FXs running I really havent used channel two much These are all your presets which many amps are doing these days Im pretty much old school and like to find my own sound However they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on Its a loud 15 watts I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems If your looking for a studiohome1st amp you cant go wrong with this guy Its now my go to amp in the studio You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one how I run it the sky is the limit Havent used the software that you need to download from Fender but will look at it later right now this amp doesnt need to be tweaked for meI loved it right out of the box Give it a test drive and let your ears decide A Very Kool Studio Amp USB Out,positive
I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG This is my 1st Gator case and Im very pleased with it It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely Being lightweight is a big plus as well and also the secure feeling of having a HSC I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it Just remember that this model is for standard type axes Strats Teles and such Great case great price,positive
good product great price works well so far bought 2 for the price of one of the others free ship one for the road one for pratice fast good price well made,positive
This works fine on a standard guitar No issues whatever I see other reviewers having issues Not sure if thats from rough handling But for casual use this one is completely fine Works just fine,positive
Well its a stand its super cheap and i dont mean the price the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well Instructions were ok came with more parts than what were required all holes filled and i have of of each part extra the guitars do not sit very well in this stand i will use it until i can find a better one it will get replaced i really should send this POS back to Amazon the concept is great but the execution of it sucks it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand there are better options out there for something portable this stand is worth 1000 tops if i had it to do all over i would save my money As cheap as the come,negative
Fender Heavies what more needs to be said Great price for the quantity Just buy it so you dont have to worry about losing a pick or storing extras around various places You need these I mean it is what it isnot much to say,positive
this makes the second one of this straps that I have ordered and I love them They are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself I dont have not one bad thing to say great buy and will do it again if I ever need anouther strap great strap,positive
Bought this for my son Its perfect for practice Great portability Has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound Sounds great with an electric acoustic Its surprisingly loud for a small amp You cant beat the price I highly recommend this Awesome little amp,positive
First time using item and it broke The round back that screws onto the mic stand broke I was really excited to have this and us it now that I transferred all my music sheet to my iPad As soon as I took it off the mic stand the round piece came off Would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review but it only kept referring to delivery I do like the product and it did hold my iPad steady even with a leather case on Sad Disappointment First Not so good review,negative
Couldnt be happier than playing with a variety of picks each one has a different feel and sound The dura picks have more variety theres only one in each thickness The celluloid ones come two per size As a pick I liked using all of them from the super floppy thinnest dura to the hard plastic thickest celluloid Worth getting even if just to experiment some of the picks were easier to use for certain songs than others and the different thicknesses definitely have a different sound Similar thickness picks of both material sounded the same but felt different to the fingers A nice sampler set of picks,positive
I had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing Ultimately my search was narrowed down to this Spider and a Fender Mustang After reading many Amazon reviews I ultimately chose the Spider over the Fender because i I read that the Fender amps gave off a hissing noise particularly with the clean channels and ii the Spider had better rockmetal tones which is one genre I play among others Regarding the sound it is unbelievable And to be quite honest Ive only been using the presets The cleans are ultra clear and the rock tones are amazing And this thing is LOUD In conducting some internet research having a megawatted amp is not necessary and is in fact not recommended I discovered that the reason for this is because the sweet spot for the volume is going to be when the amp is about threequarters of the way up In home practice unless you arent married and live in the boonies you wont get there With live play this could hold its own and in the sweet spot As another reviewer mentioned if you need something louder because youre in a larger venue the amp will be micd anywayOne noteLine 6 does somewhat force you to purchase one of the pedals because you need the pedal to update the amp I purchased theLine 6 FBV Express MkII 4button Foot Controller and Im very happy with it I like the larger foot pedal switches on this 4pedal switch rather than the small buttons on the model up from that a 6 button pedal boardFinally I chose this Spider IV over the Spider IV 120 amp version in part because this Spider has a larger speaker a 12 and the other Spider IV 120 watt model has two 10 speakers I feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones Blown Away,positive
The previous reviews are pretty accurate though I would add that when the Pignose cabinet is closed it can often sound rather boxy It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inchesAs for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree It reaches a point if pushed too hard at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill You can use a distortion overdrive to decent effect especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer I dont think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey for example though which has more dirt in the tones it produces I dont have a fuzz box not yet but have one on order but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz Otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the soundMy wah wah a Morley Power Wah was almost useless with it The limited frequency response of the 5 speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself againA chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it but a phaser in my case a Phase 90 just destroys the sound A flanger is also not really advisable You can use delay just not with very rapid repeats Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose speaker I just bought a Dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggyThis is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business Once the young un seems dedicated though it is time to think about moving up to a VOX AC15C1 note that amp can do hard rock fine but not high gain metal or an ENGL Screamer I personally cant imagine recording with it but Y guess that would depend on the engineering skills available to you Using Pedals With it is a Mixed Bag,neutral
I play guitar and keyboard and sometimes I need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards I would not do that without this straplok Essential for guitars security,positive
These are sturdy just the right length and the design means that you can save space in arranging your effects pedals with enough length and flexibility to arrange them in a semicircle if like me you have a lot of pedals Economical sturdy and spacesaving,positive
1 If you are totally a beginner and have nothing to begin with get this guitar and a Vox amplug AC30 Use it with your headphones or home speakers2 Dont upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level Prepare 1000 for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade If your budget is below that dont bother and save moreSpeak from experience Ive tried a lot and did many research This guitar with amplug just sound amazing Plus it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out Guitars and amps below 400 yes there are good stuff but youre more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter For a budget around 1000 if you dont go professional you will be happy with them forever So do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and moneyThis guitar is good enough for any beginners Most under 400 guitars dont have good pickups so why spend extra money Again my bloody experience taught me thatIve spent time and money way more than 1000 Free adviceI strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price Always steal from Amazon heres another chance,positive
Dava picks are one of lifes guilty little pleasures They may seem pricey for picks but theyre still not that expensive I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all goneI use these to play slide I also have Fender and Musicians Friend picks but those are just the standard flat stampedout pieces of plastic The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control And they just plain feel good to use The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide but with Dava you get a great grip One of lifes guilty little pleasures,positive

Well at first i was looking for a reverb with a long and deep sound like a grail or church then i read about this tone print thing and i really like it this give you a totally new range of sound based on a specific artist preset so you can have a bunch of tone prints that you can download from the webpage the only thing that could be better is the instructions on how to download the tone prints it doesnt came with the instructions although is really easy but at first i was blindfolded but overall it is great Tone Prints OMG,positive
I like thin picks myself and this one is VERY thin You wontuse it all the time but every now and then it can be used in the right situation If you are a player who is somewhat meatfisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off it is ideal Also if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar it is awesome No power chords with this little guy but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it The nonslippery texture and its grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most it makes them easier to hold on to I give them a thumbs up Very thin But great for acoustic guitar strumming,positive
Basically this case is very sharp looking made with good quality materials The inside of the one I received was grey fur The case would probably take a beating over time but its not a SKB case Nice enough that I wouldnt check it at the airport Survived a trip in a moving van from Philly to BostonWould definitely recommended if you need a case that your Les Paul fits very snugly and safely into Good quality case the fits my Epi 56 Goldtop Reissue,positive
Not much to say here but is really nice to have around Hold my picks tight and has them where i need them Relly nice,positive
Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff Only time will tell how well the soldering is Sounds fine to me flexible soft rubber is great,positive
it does what it says it does only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week hydration station,positive
This microphone stand it a fairly good buy Because it is a light and portable stand it is not built to be fully extended with microphones such as the Behringer XM1800S Adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone I found that I needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended As it stands I would suggest this as a fairly good deal ships as expected,positive
Im using this with an Ovation Balladeer A guitar with a rounded back that demands you use it with a guitar strap at all times My guitar strap is over 50 years old circa 1967 so the leather is a bit worn and it had a tendency to slide off the strap holders on the guitar at the most inopportune timesWith these strap loks the strap never comes off I leave it on when I put the guitar in the case and they are there and waiting when I get it back out Ive had it on for 2 and a half months now with no problems The hardest part was putting them on which really wasnt hard at all just took a moment to understand the mechanics of the mechanism and voila Bobs your uncleRecommend these for anyone who needs to keep their guitar strapped and ready for action They are plastic and will wear out someday Ill buy another pair then Ergo Lok Strap stays with you for life,positive
This is a fantastic product that is well made The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect conditionThe tool is extremely useful I have just started playing with a band and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in With the wheel I immediately know what chords to choose from I also know what notes are in each chord In addition it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playingThe wheel is also invaluable for switching keys For example say youre playing the I IV and V chords in the key of C but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb find out the new I IV and V chords and start playing The wheel makes chord transposition a breezeI feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair This is a very useful product at a fair priceNo I am not affiliated with the company at all Im just a band member newbie who appreciates this toolIn my opinion this is a five star product Counter to These Negative Reviews,negative
They work as well as any Dunlop pick they dont crack which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks because they get flimsy after a while Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store Review Theyre picks,positive
I am not a fussy person about guitar strings They either sound good or they dont to you and you are the one that matters I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside Martin is at the top of the heap These strings sound light and bright Very pleased with this purchase Priced Great and Sound Very Good Too,positive
I wont rant about a string winder They arent that technical of an item but I do like the string cutter I do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but I am not going to be that picky This unit works just fine and I am sure that I will lose it before It breaks It just works,positive
I got one of those for my next mandolin after my Johnson I couldnt see spending 40 bucks for a case for a 50 dollar instrument so I didnt However the next one cost a few hundred and I got one of these cases that has served me well These are pretty soft inside and fit most Astyles pretty well The hardware is decent but I wouldnt expect the hinges to last forever Theyll be easy enough to fixreplace when they fall off so no worries thereIf I had a 250000 GibsonWeberWhatever I wouldnt buy this Id spend the money for a really nice case but since I dont I didnt If you DO have an expensive instrument and want to cheap out these really are decent little cases but you wont mistake it for a really expensive one and thats fineIf its still built like my case never can tell these days itll have a little storage compartment that will hold a bunch of pics capo and a little tuner with no problem Not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there For the money its a good deal on a hardshell case,positive
These strings have great tone and feel They seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time QUALITY TONE THAT LASTS,positive
I read the reviews here on Amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first Eventually I went ahead and sprung for it since it wasnt expensive I only needed one and expected the package to come with just one but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise Ive had them for 23 months now and they havent failed me yet They keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces Really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and I had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor The only complaint I have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick and they are an EXTREMELY snug fit which makes me kinda nervous However I keep them as tight as I can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far Not sure why the other reviews were so negative but I have no complaints Does what I want it to do,positive
This guitar stand does NOT find hidden treasure It does NOT hypnotize beautiful women It does NOT fix your transmission It does NOT tell your boss to give you a raiseIt just holds onto your guitar when you dont see any reason to put into a case Its sturdy reliable and to the point No gimmicks nothing flashy Just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced If you need one might as well be this one In Soviet Russia guitar stand holds YOU D,positive
So these are heavy strings that work well I did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough Heavy,positive
Well MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars these strings were designed for the new 800 Rosewood series guitars that came out this year 2014 the promise is a 34bolder high end fuller low end34 I am a longtime Taylor owner and favor their 800 series RosewoodSpruce is my favorite combo in tone woods I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12Fret such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HDs took some getting used to as far as feel due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings E B G but as far as sound they are great the D A low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of 34fuller low end34 compared to what Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylors but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings that is what I notice most from the HDs compared to the regular I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PBs but will most likely continue to run the HDs on my 12fret I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any differenceimprovement so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain try them out and make your own decision Taylor Made,positive
Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones Normally I used the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks but I gotta say these are great Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely Not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great Pickin,positive
Got it for 500 bucks and wish Id bought about 5 moreJust as good as anything else out thereOnlky complant is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as Id likebut thats my take on itBuy if you need a standFor the moneyyou wont be disappointed Unbelieveable,positive
Item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed does not need and installation and setup this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars I ll buy more for the other guitars at my house Excellent,positive
A great little amplifier Good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around I replaced the stock speaker with an Eminence Rajun Cajun which has improved the tone and provided increased volume The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs I would highly recommend Great Little Amp,positive
This clip on tuner by Snark is fantastic works great It alows you to fine tune each string Buy it Best Guitar Tuner you can buy,positive
Stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully Constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment A stand which becomes an artpiece,positive
It is a nice clip works for my micsI dont like the soft opening It makes you not easy to put back the mics Nice holder,positive
Bought this years ago It was a nice long cable that I bought figuring itd be durable but it didnt last Maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig If I was better with wiring Im sure its fixable but all in all it didnt last as long as Id hoped Long cable stopped working fast,negative
What really can you say about Switchcraft they just make good solid parts Grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack Jacked,positive
Picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology These pick are cutting edge None better Possibility created by the multiflex feature and the grip Awesome These make me a better player I used to have trouble holding on to picks Problem solved Stress gone These picks work fab,positive
Got it right b4 xmas thanks AmazonIt is one of the best value I have purchased Suction design is great for any size of string instruments uke small soundholded guitars or acoustic guitars Thanks for the previous viewers tip to moisture the suction b4 pressuring on the surface of the guitar that next to the bridge It stays great and pickups perfectly without any unwanted noise from the pickup wire itself recently have bought another one does great value and quality for 11 i spent ever Almost Perfect,positive
Im not much of a slide player but I figure every guitarist should at least OWN one of these Just dont drop it on the floor like I did with the last one I had Nice,positive
The DAddario sets are good stuff I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran With stretching they stay in tune fine The unknown truth about nonnylon strings and maybe even them too is that there are only a handful of string makers and DAddario actually makes them for other companies Gore uses them for their Elixir series and just adds the polyweb coating I also use the GHS standard 010 sets and they are good too My faves are the Ernie Ball sets but they rarely go on sale I dont remember who makes what strings for what companies though With offshore production a standard thing now its no telling where they actually come from anyways I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production for instance good strings,positive
Bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied I am not having any problems fastening to a stand or cam corder and I am able to clamp the swivel lock very securely I am only using for lightweight applications Certainly worth the 7 Works very well,positive
I like a mellow sound with a smooth feel These strings are what I needed and they performDAddario ECG23 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Smooth and Mellow,positive
Very nice bridge This was an OEM part so didnt come with screws springsclaw or tremolo bar just the bridge itself Not the best but for the price was a killer deal The block is full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles Would be a good replacement for an older MIM Strat with the smaller block or other Asian import or just to replace one thats wore out Like I stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality Nice Bridge,positive
I had a lot of questions and concerns when I ordered this Well it arrived today Ive been playing it for the past few hours and heres the answers to those questions1 Is it worth the moneyAbsolutely yes This is an amazing bargain There are better guitars out there but not for 170 This really is a great deal2 How does it soundFantastic Its definitely bright which a few of the other reviews pointed out but it also has new strings on it so it might be a little too early to judge That said its got a nice full sound and if you play up closer to the neck you get more bass in the mix3 Hows the actionJust right Low enough that its easy to play for a 12 string but no buzzing strings4 How about the neckWider than a 6 string but not much Probably a centimeter or so wider I have small hands and had no problem playing it The main thing is the added pressure it takes to push down twice as many strings as normal5 How does it playGreat6 How does it lookGreat Nice natural finish all shiny and new Whats not to love Note the picture shows a more whitish finish but its a normal natural finish like youd see on most acoustic guitars Natural wood colorSo if any of you guitarists have been thinking of buying an acoustic 12 string take a look at this one for sure I wish Id bought it long ago There are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string Buy this guitar Its a great deal sounds great plays great,positive
Thsese are the perfect size for my Jazzmaster Too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly Maybe my hands are just sweaty Fender Stings what else is there to say,positive
I bought this product for only one reason I have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or PAtype clean high powered two channels that I want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup This tube modeler acts first as a preamp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the nonguitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps I dont really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement I just want the guitar amp sound and style I also use it in front of a Behringer UltraG DI box so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my nonguitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house PA I dont think that many people would do thisThe sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but Ive used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove PA speakers bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not As I said I dont really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box It works for meI read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2 and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do I would consider getting the GT2 in the future but for now this product is for me the poor mans tube amp The poor mans tube amp,positive
I bought these because I needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board I have the Planet Waves patch cords called 634 so I thought these would cover it being 1234 When I went to hook up they were still too short so I immediately blamed these cords OOOOOPS took out the tape measure so I could complain and found that these are indeed 1234 I then measured the Planet Waves and found they were actually 1034 not 634 My bad These seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are If you want to spice up your board go for some color GOOD ASSORTMENT,positive
I love this thing It quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument I own electric acoustic guitars electric acoustic bass guitars It clips on securely is easy to see stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on off From the front you can barely notice it at all I just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed When I switch to another instrument I unclip it and take it with me to what ever I want to play nextI love this thing Love it love it love it Rock solid,positive
Great for the desktop and vocals I have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet Its an important component in my studio Really nice stand and cheap,positive
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven I use them all the time Best product,positive
Recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party upon installation and testing the unit blew a fuseGoing to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing if not Ill be returning mine will updateUPDATE Radio Shack carries the correct fuses for this unit upon changing the fuse the unit works as expectedLeaks a bit while using so dont stand under itBut most on these things leak anyway Well see,neutral
Every midi usb converter on amazon below 50 bucks seemed sketchy but I tried this one with my Casio keyboard Works on Logic and Garageband however whenever I try to use modulation or pitch bend it creates a actual note on my Mac and wont stop unless you quit the program Be wary Be Ready For Things To Not Work,positive
I wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise I use it to zero in the tone of my Alvarez acoustic for live shows The pedal is quiet and solidly built The price is great too Nice pedal Great price,positive
I picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit It does a wonderful job of that Drive set low and the level set high Tone set to taste The additional noise it produces is relatively low so you wont have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with As with any other Boss pedals its well made and reliable Great boost to your amps overdrive,positive
Excellent tuner I appreciate its compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock It performs as it should and appears to be quite durable Being able to angle the unit is great The back light works well in dim light and of course the piezo mode makes tuning in noisey invironments quite easy They do mean it when they say to replace the battery when you get it Mine lasted for a couple of weeks It was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront All in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly Simply does what it says and does it well,positive
This one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar I tried it on bass and it gives you that big raw ad thick stoner metal bass sound I like it Excellent for bass,positive
Whenever I played with traditional strings my fingertips would turn green This was because bare metal would react with the salt and sweat from my fingers and oxidize similar to the Statue of Liberty This corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out The defining feature of this product is the coating which is meant to prevent moisture from causing this reaction Therefore your strings last much longer Traditionally the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings However this product is wonderful For the first 3 days the strings sound strange But after they stretch out a little they sound perfectly fine My fingers have stopped turning green proof that the product works I have yet to buy another set of strings2 months laterThese strings have been great but I do have to admit they do not last 3 to 5 times as long as advertised They last about twice as long The Proof is on My Fingers,neutral
This is a great pedal to have in your setup for those times you want a clean sound that will cut through the mix yet will not just sound blaringly loud and undefined I used a Boss compression pedal for many years and the Dyna Comp was definitely a refreshing step in the right direction It just sounds more organic and less sterile than the Boss Pedal I also think in this case less is more as far as the controls are concerned An Essential Compressor That I Prefer Over Boss,positive
My son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings Not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago These strings tend to repel the dirt and dust even with heavy play the strings look very good He has been getting less callous on his fingers The tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price My son has a very heavy hand but these strings are well made and withstand play from any style Long lasting little pain,positive
I guess the term toppy describes the sampling range which picks up the higher notes If you want to get the right effect this is a good choice For those of us who find acoustic guitars difficult to play this is solution Personally I have a lazy blues style and my attempts to play acoustic guitars too often feels like I am using a manual typewriter This product does what it says on the box but sounds better using hum bucker pickups or if you play a strat it sounds very good on the middle or neck pickup Dont use the bridge pickup as it doesnt sound too good A little toppy,positive
Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless I will try to get a replacement Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need Works great if it doesnt break,negative
The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting good enuf okay I guess But after transporting and reset I found them to be junk fix the adjustment boom screw and it will be a great stand,negative
I still operate in an analog environment quite often so I end up using lots of inserts I have 8 channels of compression limiter gate and expander plus various EQs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels I have an insert snake that I use as well but the individual insert cables of differing lengths that I carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show Soundman must have insert cables,positive
I like to hit things I use drums so nobody else gets hurt I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not say local wildlife These have the sweetest tone for batterybased abuse Thanks Vic Also flammable There were so many drumsticks to choose from so I just picked these to get it over with,positive
Ill echo what others have said this is a superbly built instrument for the price and I dont know how Epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively It looks feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as muchA few notes what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the 34Vintage34 model is actually a superrich deep deep mahoganymaroon color and its unbelievably beautifulAs others have said the factorysupplied strings are crap if you judge the instrument by them youll be disappointed Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele and restring it as soon as you get itI was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my 60 Kala soprano ukenormally one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder fuller sound But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an allacoustic ukulele and that probably accounts for the quieter tone I think its a better tone and Im more interested in delicacy than in loudness so Im happy with it If I wanted stadiumfilling volume I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall ampsOh I almost forgot one important note to all owners IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID UGLY PICK GUARD Since ukulele players rarely use picks and when we do we use soft rubber or felt ones theres no need to protect the finish from scratching and that white pick guard really detracts from the instruments looksI applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernailsno sharp tools It came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton without any damage to the luscious ultraglossy lacquer finish And the ukulele looks SO much better now If you feel as I do feel free to do likewise Just remember the key words SLOW and GENTLE Dont force anything and you should be fine An exceptional value and you can get rid of the pick guard,positive
First of all 20 ft is not too long Better to have a little bit of extra length than too short The cable works fine and is very flexible Also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones Recommended Very nice product,positive
As a guitarist whos had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center back in 1999 trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task While Ill chose DAddario EXLs for electric Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them Granted thats only aesthetic My top choice for acoustic,positive
I have acoustic guitar experience to a novice level but I have also wanted to learn the Ukulele for quite some time As I had never so much as touched a ukulele before buying this one I looked for a lowcost soprano to see whether I would enjoy playing such a similar looking but very different sounding and smaller instrumentUpon receiving this item I tuned it up and had a little play using a few basic chords I learned The Uke sounded acceptable but I was slightly disappointed by the sound of the default supplied strings Also at first as I expected the Ukelele went badly out of tune quickly when playing but after a few hours the strings broke in and now keep their tuning with only occasional minor tweaks requiredOf course most cheap ukuleles come with fairly terrible and cheap strings so it would be wrong of me to be too critical when this instrument cost so little I have now ordered some Aquila strings from Amazon to replace the default strings ie I bought theAquila AQS Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings I am still waiting for delivery on these and will update this review when I eventually fit them as to the difference it makes which I expect will be a significant improvement in sound based upon my research To be honest though the default strings on this ukulele arent too bad so I may wait a while to install the Aquilla strings until I can play more competently and get the benefit of themAs far as the design and quality of this ukulele goes I was pleasantly surprised and impressed The paintjob was blemish free and well done the unit appears to have been assembled well using adequate components and the tuner backs on the reverse of the headstock are decorative little gold dolphins which is a nice touch The unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrumentFor the money it costs it is difficult to voice any serious gripes at all with this ukulele Im very much looking forward to getting more competent with the instrument over the coming months I really couldnt imagine giving this ukulele anything less than a full five stars its great Cute looking and fun to play,positive
I love this tuner Its awesome to use and efficient The only thing I wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are To my ear it sounds good but you never know Dang Good,positive
Hosa has good cables I use them between my guitar effects pedals and then a 5 footer from effects to the amp Had them over two months a they work great Excellent,positive
I like this so much I bought 4 and going back for more Spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks There is a peel and stick on the back to attach it to a guitar strap or behind the headstock I Keep one in each guitar case I am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends Fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick Very good accessory for guitar players,positive
A quality lowcost capo that is so easy to use that does a perfect job and claps on the guitar strap out of the way when not in use Great Capo,positive
I have had the Shure version of this mic not naming any names haha and this mic is just as good Actually I take it back its better than the shure mic because this one isnt overpriced The BEST mic for the money,positive
Tone control didnt work so it was returned But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fretboard quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups The sound is lets say average Good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups The boltin neck didnt bother me but the SG 400 doesnt have that which is another reason I would step up next time Shape is ok Purely subjective I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since its more conservative But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style Cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks Also even though I was tempted with the faded finish the glossy finish is really nice This guitar will make a player proud Nice finished guitar,positive
Does what a strap should holds guitar fine and is built well for five bucks I like the unique pattern on this thing too Came in a timely manner what else is there to say Made in Canada Cool looking and low cost,positive
I could go on and on for days but the best things about EZD are the endless EZX packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live organic sound that you can never get with loopsYou can edit the grooves and fills via MIDI if you need too add in cymbals etc Its really really an amazing program Best money I ever spent Simply Amazing,positive
Likes Pretty smooth Minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some Bright strong mids They do seem to stay in tune well Havent had to change tuning once they settled inWill update this review with more experience as I play on these strings over the next week Great strings,positive
I have been using those webbed nylon sometimes cutting straps for years cause they were inexpensive but not cheap Dont know why I waited so long Quality in this baby comfortable too Great purchase,positive
I have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable My acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand sturdy,positive
i love abalone these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well the thin picks are pretty thin which make them nice for acoustic strumming and whatnot but i would recommend mediums at least for the electric guitar always use these,positive
Being a studio owner I didnt buy this for stage work Being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades Ive had many different tuners including real strobes So when I picked this up about 8 months ago it was because I needed one where I was at and right nowI dont know about the 1 accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me its quite accurate enough that I can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it By using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instrumentsIm still using the replacement battery I put in about 6 months ago but I just use it and unplug Its travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from 35000 feet and continue workingI was shocked by how well it works I was shocked by the fact that I could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close Highly recommended Still Shocked After 8 Months,positive
A classic mic clip simple inexpensive and durable enough Keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break Does what its supposed to do,positive
This tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar It gets the job done easily and very fast works wonders,positive
This is exactly what I was looking for to go into my case or my pocket I will not put this on the back of my guitar but you do have the option Perfect fit for medium picks Ease of use and durable Have purchased another one Good deal Great price and very handy,positive
This stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up Allows you to get close to the mic and still play an instrument like say a guitar Can be used either sitting or standing Recommend highly Be sure to get a pop screen for your mic and recording needs to improve recording quality necessary for home studio,positive
I carry this in my bass gig bag so I can plug my phone into the mono auxinput on the back of my Genz Benz bass head Handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement my bass cab is full range fEARful 1561 Before picking this up I used a couple of cables adapters to go from stereo 1834 to mono 1434 and it often seemed I never had quite what I needed on hand The exact cable I need for my application,positive
This is a nice addition to a guitar that you dont want to drill a hole into for a strap button Its a quick release with the buckle One end stays on the strap the other around the head stock of the guitar Makes it nice if you have more than one guitar without a strap button Buy 2 Quality product,positive
I bought a cheep violin to decide if I would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping The peg drops really helped keep it in tune I wouldnt have been able to do it without the drops The Best for a cheep violin,positive
I swear by these strings These are the only strings I will use on my Les Paul Their bright tone sounds great and full while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze Dont buy these strings just because I like them buy them because they suit you Because you like the tone they provide Because they feel good against your fingers Cons What cons Try them Bright tones and color coded,positive

Ive got two other Levys cotton straps that I picked up at local brick and mortar stores and theyre fantastic I picked one up on Amazon and I was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what I had bought before I suppose its just easier for theNo big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and youre a big guy like me andor you play with the guitarbass around your knees you may not be getting what you thoughtIn any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last Great strap BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE TWO LENGTHS AVAILABLE,positive
Im not very familiar with how pop filters actually work apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording I have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on I dont know how it compares to other pop filters though but this one seems like it works for me Easy to use works,positive
NOT high quality but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks Ends are not too bad and it works for what it is Descent cable but,neutral
Works awesome Five Stars,positive
And thats all Ive got to say about it It hasnt stuck broken or slipped in any of the stringchanges Ive used it for Costs a little extra but well worth that price Youll need a new one about every ten years or so Basic but does the job excellently well,positive
This little music stand folds up small enough after some disassembly to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide Once assembled it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books The height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether youre standing seated on a stool or in a chair The angle of the tray is not adjustable The legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location But for a portable stand its hard to find fault with this one especially given the low cost Sturdy enough very portable,positive
After a little bit of configuration headaches I can confirm this product works quite well with ardour2 and is my prefered method of mixing For the price its a really good deal Works well with ardour2,positive
I now have these tuners on an American Strat and an American Tele They seem a lot smoother than the stock Fender tuners which honestly I have no problem with These were purchased on a whim I dont find changing strings that big of a bother These will save you a few minutes I guess if youre a gigging musician they would be of more value for quick string changes to an onstage guitar Dont get me wrong If you want a set of locking tuners for your American or Mexican Fender guitar these are excellent But Im not sure that most people would derive enough benefit out of them to warrant replacing a good functioning set of regular tuners I like them I dont love them Great product,positive
A good modeling amp My only complaint is I didnt like the clean sounds not to my liking Other than that an awesome amp Good amp,positive
You get a 10 speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around 9000This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I owna butt load of new ampsI have actually upgraded to a Champion 40 but still use this amp as much as the 40Dont even think about it this is one of the best under 10000 practice amps unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp and in that case you should look elsewhere as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice timeAs an addendum I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras I have read from other reviewers I have a few of these amps so just for the heck of itI put in a Celestion G10 Greenback which costs more than the 25R and was very disappointed withthe resultsThis amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now but can still be had new for under 10000 if you just do an internet search Best no frills practice amp on the market,positive
After playing digital equipment for years I recently got into analog pun intended starting with an overdrive pedalI had always heard a lot about the RAT and I wanted to try it outI played a Boss DS1 at a store and thought it was a decent distortion but found it too trebly and thinThe Rat with all the knobs on 12 oclock sounds like a great rock amp Like a perfect marshall but with more organicness It really has its own tone I must add Fat thick smooth and saturated It responds to picking very well and organicallyAs you move the distortion knob higher the sounds gets more and more animal Very thick and furry The tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound With lower settngs the tone becomes more trebly and smooth and with higher settings it gets closer to fuzz Very niceA nice pedal to have to be sure Great Fat Analog Distortion,positive
These strings are very nice and sound great Elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price Great,positive
I was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is I really like the right angle plug for my amp it doesnt make the wire stick out like a straight plug would Good stuff Great flexibility and the connection is clean,positive
Ive owned and used this product for some time now and am quite happy with it I did notice that I had problems with an unpleasant humming introduced one time when using it with powered speakers but I believe this was more so my fault than that of the unit I learned that my active speakers did not care for input cables past a certain length For greater distances using a wireless transmitter to deliver the mixed sound and its matching wireless receiver connected to the speaker units solved this problem completely The FX processor works flawlessly just as long as I remember to push down the selector to engage the desired function Very easy to use Compact in size No ability to instantly mute an input device other than to turn down the gain For the price what can you expectSoon I will be in the market for an upgrade one that has slider controls and the ability to connect to my laptop via usb I need a few more xlr inputs and at least a 7 band equalizer and compressorlimiter for larger gigs and a fairly large choral group and its accompanying instruments Just waiting for a good deal Sturdy Dependable and Easy To Use Product Works Great,positive
I have owned two of these stands The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place Not the greatest stands by any means but for what theyre worth I didnt mind spending another 10 to get one Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable But price ability to collapse and its light weight made it the one I bought again Good for what its worth,neutral

My C5CE Washburn has been a very good purchase I was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords I prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one It has the ability to plug into an amp has easy access to the battery has a built in easy to use tuner and the wiring dose not rattle about It has a good compensated saddle the frets are level and do not buzz has a truss rod in the neck and has a bound rosewood fingerboard I have always liked the sound of classic guitars like the option to plug in and am more impressed by sound than brand nameA person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck This is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar It rings out very well so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged inMine has some edges not well stained likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly Top is a bit wavy from buffing Still has some orange peel but not a lot Lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference Some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top sort of a classic color that I have gotten used to nowOther guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs this model is not I was not clear enough above where I mentioned laminated woodsIf something happened to it I would be likely to replace it with another one just like it A very cost effective good sounding well made guitar Good job Washburn Best bang for the buck,positive
This is a cheaper alternative to the 34String Swing34 wall mount considerably less expensive It works fine Its easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well The only downside is that the wall anchors arent the heavyduty plastic screwin types but the smaller drillaholeandhammerinplace types which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others Of course you can always purchase a couple of screwin heavyduty mounts and youll still save considerablyThis of course doesnt have the beautiful hardwood finish of the String Swing For the lower price you get black plastic But its sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job If it had sturdier wall mounts Id give it 5 stars As it is the cheaper and lesstrustworthy mounts bring it 4 stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative It is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screwin mounts should hold any size guitar Cheaper alternative,positive
My kids were excited to split this pack of picks Since there were two of each in the pack they didnt have to argue over who got which pick These are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing I think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the 60s and 70s I love these very unique picks,positive
This is an essential accessory for the excellent Line 6 Spider IV combo amps For more details see my review of the Line 6 Spider IV 75 watt combo The FBV Express Mk II is the least expensive pedal to give one full control over all basic and essential amp features This pedal should have been or be included with the amp but it wasnt Anyway if you are considering buying the amp which is great you really will want to have this pedal even though it costs 33 of the price of the amp itselfWith the FBV Express Mk II you can store the 4 amp channels each of which has its own settings for model and all effects as well as control the 14 second looping ability of the Spider IV The pedal also adds a volumeway pedal the wah pedal is OK but not as fullthroated as a Cry Baby or other standalone wah wahs Without the pedal you will not be able to access looping and channel switching in real time while playing which is the whole point of this thing unless you have more than the standard compliment of 2 arms equipped with one hand eachThe pedal also interfaces with a computer to allow deep editing and storing of all of the effects of the Line 6 Spider IV combos through a USB port This feature alone makes it a musthave for taking full advantage of the ampJM Tepper Absolutely required for the Line 6 Spider IV Combo guitar amps,positive
Simply put this speaker turned my Super Champ XD into a killer 15watt amp Gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer I would and do recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their Super Champ sound And like other people have said the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting I had to turn the amp down two notches two number to have the same volume level out of the ampIf my Super Champ was stolen Id buy a new one and put this speaker in it Wouldnt even think twice about it Turned My Super Champ XD Into A New Amp,positive
Although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal I was recording in an hour had the software on my Mac talking to it It sounds great with little of its own noise The percussion loops are fine at least provide solid guides for recording I have a GNX4 that I love as far as this pedal goes I am just as happy I echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over fiddling with the small knobs Update The software works well is very useful It loaded right up with no problem Memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once I start using the pedal more often Thats the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal More than worth it though Solid easy to use looper,positive
I bought this planet wave cables because i have a Electro Harmonix OD Glove and a Line 6 M5 so i needed a small cable for both pedals I highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable with Right Angle Plug 05,positive
I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put Even so it was a good quality button The leather is tough and will last for years It will probably outlast the guitarIf youre looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit But its really worth the hassle Challenging To Apply,neutral
Works like a champ I only have four pedals on it thus far but I havente had any problems No noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldnt handle the load I still have open leads for those other pedalssmile My power strip now has more space for other toys to make my weak playing sound better Super,positive

Seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website but there is no dealer anywhere near me so I bought one sightunseen from Amazon based on the good reviews Im glad to say I can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative designA traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction The narrow reversetaper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottomheavy look when viewed vertically Back and sides are cherry with only a light stain and the binding is dark The top is natural cedarAs dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down It appears to be based on the Martin outline but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout Weight is pleasantly light and the semigloss finish is comfortable to the touch Players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard but those with small hands should consider the Slim version with a neck 008 narrower at the nutSound is what really counts however and this Canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there The maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with highquality fresh strings allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up Overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volumeBuying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer Both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering and the truss rod required adjustment a longreach hex wrench is included If you are not experienced in these tasks a local luthier should do it for no more than 30 or soBased on sound playability once adjusted and construction quality this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range It is a real standout in valueUpdate 8 DEC 2012 The more I play this guitar the more I love it It delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought snap and once the action was dialed in the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding I didnt fully realize hindered my playing I am considerng replacing my Takamine minijumbo with a Seagull equivalent Seagull S6 Dreadnought,positive
In the interest of full disclosure this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned That being said the strap is fairly soft and pliable with that almost broken in feel I was expecting it to be a little stiffer but Im glad it isnt It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine My guitar is nothing fancy so I would presume the strap locks are pretty standard The fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap but I didntThe range of fit seems pretty good to me I am 6 tall and wear my acoustic up a little high kind of folk style I guess If I want to I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leatherlogo patch on it while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside I cant see it marring the guitar at all It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder Made in Canada seems well built and durable Once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back and Keith gets to keep his head fashionable If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can Thanks for readingSPO Much better than my old shoelace but less fashionable than Keith Richards old headscarves,positive
Very good stand especially for the price It is not incredibly stable but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy Excellent for the price,positive
This Behringer DD400 delay unit has a lot of great features I particularly like the stereo outputs which allow the user to send the delayed signal to a separate amplifier for a dramatic stereo effect The extralong 1300 millisecond delay is great for Pink FloydDavid Gilmour style solos The shorter delay settings allow for rockabilly slap back effects although I hardly ever play in that style so it doesnt matter that much to meHeres where it gets weird I tested the unit using a vintage Fender tube amp for the primary signal and a Vox Valvestate amp for the delayed signal As long as I played loudly everything worked quite well However when I set the guitar down for a moment I started hearing voices Yes voices The delay unit was picking up radio frequency interference a la Jimi Hendrix at Berkeley I have no idea HOW it was doing this but I could clearly hear some sort of radio transmission like CB or family band radio The interference went away after a few minutesAs for design I dont buy the German innovation advertising line from Behringer This is obviously a cheap Chinese copy of the legendary Boss DD7 which costs four times as much If you want really good quality buy the Boss unit If you can get buy on a fairly cheap delay unit that talks to you from time to time the Behringer is ok OK for the money but not great,neutral
This pedal is a must have for any pedal board I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best Must have,positive

Great little mixing console for home use and practiceI use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where I need to connect my guitar a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kitThis thing has phantom power just in case you didnt read that alreadyOverall I can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features youd need and even has a british EQ to help shape your sound a bitCons Not many One gripe about this unit is that it has no power button I mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh You have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off Apart from that the LED is wayyy too bright so bright that you cant look at the device for very long and obviously cant make out the writing and control labels on the device I notice all Behringer pedals come with this bright led What I usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the ledI recommend getting this unit and only gave it 4 stars because of the few cons listed above Great Mixer,positive
Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967 a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone I guess the 58 gets Batman status relegating the 57 to that of Robin But thats not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time and except for the 58s acoustic foam lined cage pop screen the two mics are identical electricallyThe SM Studio Microphone 57 was designed to begin its life in a recording studio as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers drum kits etc In that capacity it had no use for the pop screen of its cousin the SM58 still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day So the SM57 slimmed down and even though its still a fine vocal mic youll see it used mostly micing instruments which it excels atOne of its long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House A pair of SM57s is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of useThe SM57 is an extremely rugged mic built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse Thats one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies And on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the priceThere is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different So make sure you try before you buyBottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced A best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians One Half Of Shures Long Lasting Dynamic Duo,positive
Not expensive Not cheap Not exactly what I wantedLike most all of the Behringer items it has good points and duh pointsIf you use it as an AB one input to 2 outs then you can use the 2 volume controls I did not need it for thatIf you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out you only control the sum out not the individual inputs thought you could which is why I bought it the 12 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can but you can not I almost sent them back I bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that I was switchingthe LED indicators when using it as a 2 in 1 out like 2 guitars into one amp or in my case a mando and a midiguitar rig into a single line in are exactly backwards the one on the right red is actually the input on the left and the one on the left green is the input on the right which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurantOperation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bassWhen it is all said and done I am glad I kept themAmazon rocks got them in 3 days free shipping where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys who said Santa was a scrouge i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket german engineering in a china box,neutral
I recently won an Epiphone les paul specail and was in the market for a bag This fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection While I wouldnt say to drop it off the roof or run over it with your car It does seem to do a nice job of protecting it from bumps on the road and such Epiphone les paul,positive

First of all I want to say I love a tube amp distortion Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state Ive used or heard For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heardRecently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing However there is a downside Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least 250 Quality dist pedals are not budget friendlyI chose the MT2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using It gives a variety of sounds It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it Read the included book look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists settings It will help you tame this pedal into what you want Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more usefulIve seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz I must say learn how to shape sound spend time dialing it in to your rig Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT2 I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick heavy distortion with a good responseI say the MT2 is worth an investment if youre looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board One of the better distortion pedals,positive
I got this after seeing many of my church friends using them I got this one so I could use it to tune my guitars a ukulele and a violin It does all of them well Im going to buy a couple more as gifts good tuner,positive
Very nice classical guitar strap I have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons Dont expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar This is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it It will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it This is the way this type of strap is made to work and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested Holds my Cordoba in position perfectly Very nice strap for a specific application,positive
Well I ordered 2 sets of these and 2 sets of medium strings when I got my first banjo as I didnt know what gauge strings I would prefer So far I like the light strings better for clawhammer which is mostly what I play Easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at leastNot much else to say about strings P Would recommend them Easy on the fingers and sound good to me,positive

Have not used the light as much as I thought I might but it works okay Each light has multiple independent settings The beams are narrow but you get two of themThe major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag Something in the bag will trigger the switch and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it There is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transportAlso you cannot really tell from the product picture but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects It does not work well or at all with object more than 14 inch thick Okay for Thin Surfaces but Can Get Turned On Accidentally During Transport,neutral
I decided to get this tweed strap for my 50s Telecaster Classic but when it arrived I was a bit let down The tweed finish is cool enough but the strap is very thin and the strap ends are pretty poor quality If they truly are made of leather I feel sorry for the hide they came from The leather is so hard you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locksThis is decent for the time being but I am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar Feels like wearing a 10 Casio with a 1300 suit Digging The Style But Not The Quality,neutral
These are amazing little inexpensive mixers If you need to sum together some signals this can get the job doneWe have two of these in our vocal effects rack summing our effects from six feeds three per mixer down to two outputs one per mixer the mixers feed direct boxes which go back to the front of house console this lets us have the effects on stage so the performers can control them and send the signal back to the console for adding into the main mix We have no noise problems at all with these mixers and they really solved a problem for me I needed tiny flexible mixers I could preset and fit inside the rack out of the way not only were these extremely inexpensive they work greatGood luck and good music to all Handy mixer and ultra affordable problem solver,positive
This worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet Sound was good and it was easy to set upGood for the price and no regrets great,positive
This is the first guitar Ive bought without playing it first so I was apprehensive But its a fine guitar Its plain to look at no decoration or embellishments but the sound is rich and full as if it were at least ten years old I like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing The tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning It came with Savarez strings not the best Ive used but good And I was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag Its strong and durable and well designed All in all I doubt I could have found a better quality product for such a low price Plain Jane is Really Good,positive
I bought this for my son so he could record with it He does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him Bought it for my son,positive
It looks fine but as other reviewers have pointed out is thinner than the OEM plate that came on the guitar Some people mentioned putting shims behind it but a better idea might be to cut the ends of the neck screws down by an 18th of an inch so that you dont screw the neck screws in too far The plate was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon Plate is thinner thinner,positive
My ipad lives on this thing I might be considered the laziest person around but I use a mic stand to place my ipad over my head so I can watch movies in bed while laying down I sometimes feel like Im in a spaceship when I go to interact with my ipad I do wish it could rotate both directions It only goes from hamburger style to hotdog style by way of a right turn which is great if the stand sits on the right side of the bed But if you sleep on the left youre gonna have a bad time Multifunctional,positive
Im a pro musician and music teacher These are the original pick punches by the company from the guy who invented them At least thats what it says on his website The others are knockoffs They probably all work about the same and theyre all about the same price now so why not support the dude who invented them Hes really into making picks and has some pretty cool ideas and instructions on his website Im pretty crafty and really like this Bummed about rough edges Buy a fine sanding sponge at any hardware store sand the edges for a few seconds and be done with it He also sells sheets of plastic from his website at quite good prices and ink for stamping them I got a cheap rubber stamp made with my URL for about 10 online and make my own business card picks now I also found some cool sheets of celluloid on eBay its not easy to find the right stuff but the picks I make now are just as good as any you would purchase and the cost is way less for personalized pics anyway If you need hundreds or thousands of picks made well then youre better off ordering them but I have fun making 10 or 20 of them at a time to hand out to potential students and clients Oh yeah I can still recycle old cards and stuff too my students like bringing them in and making their own picks as well Everybody knows that picks just evaporate when you lose them anyway what could possibly be greener Buy this one,positive
My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 yearsI had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didnt care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for 130 and they kicked in free stringsBought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer toneMy LP Studio had its pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 8185s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price You literally cannot find a better guitar for 150 than the Special 2Sound 55Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted soundThe pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effectThe pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic Not sure which they haveSo much sustain for a bolt on neck I was shockedBuild Quality 45I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner I didnt notice in the store but the string peg was 14 up out of the headstock When I discovered this I loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that wayIntonation required no adjustmentAction was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bowThe finish was perfect No nicks blemishes just oily black goodnessNeck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed Damn good for a bolt onHardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very wellBack bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stableThe bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual stringsWeird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it No pickguard and it doesnt need one Lots of relief between strings and body You wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick Makes it easy to clean tooTruss rod is behind a nice body color plateFrets were smooth rounded and played nice Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not roughNeck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasnt an issue500k pots and side body 14 TRplug keeps the cable out of the wayOverall 55Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other 150 guitarSummary This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box ITs well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music The frets are medium jumbos and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing refretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet 2 squiers in this price rangeI would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music I did blues metal country and pop The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarityOne thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the wayAs an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldnt fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil I ended up putting the screws back inI will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in hell yeah coil tapping here I come and move my EMG 8185s in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitarDo yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar Its cheap enough that you wont care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years Almost as good as my LP Studio deluxe plustop,positive

Ive found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by Schaller and Dunlop These look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strapI use them on a PRS SE 245 and I did not need to do any additional drilling The screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secureHighly Recommended The Final Solution,positive
Great product Ive use them before and have always thought they were top quality They arent much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great Easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connecthold very solid Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap Love em,positive

This is one great looking cable I purchased this cable December 2010 and it is still working well and stilllooks good And as Fernando Lamas says it is better to look good than to feel good Well not when itcomes to cablesThis cable is 20 AWG with an UltraPure Copper Center Conductor and 100 copper and conductivepolymer shield You want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud Helps keep those ugly microphonics away and you want that big timeThe capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pFft This is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables The lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cableOut of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output It seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed This seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the moneyThis cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style They look terrific but I find this Fatso muchharder to coil than the thinner Spectraflex Vintage this company makes The bulkiness of this cabledoesnt seem to lend itself to easy coiling It also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage The easiest of my cables to coil by the way is the Lava CableMagma which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil If I were to need more cable quitehonestly I would buy the Lava Pretty doesnt count for much with meI gave this cable 4 stars because of its very good sound is well constructed has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs looks darn marvelous and has about average specs for the money Yet difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basisIf you want a beautiful well made cable that you dont have to put away every day buy this one Looks Great Spectraflex Fatso Flex Instrument Cable Right Angle Black 21 Foot,positive
For this review I used the services of my supermusician friend Mike Thanks for the very thorough review MikeDAddario XL Nickel WoundRegular Light Gauge EXL110Bright Round Wound010046I installed these strings on a Schecter Diamond Serier Acoustic Electric HybridC1 EA in order to test the sound using both acoustic and electric settings The strings were easy to work with on installationIn particular I liked the color coding of the strings vs the traditional individuallywrapped strings The color coding makes it hard to accidentally mix similar strings and ismore environmentally friendly in terms of packaging Also the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longerThe strings tuned up quickly and reached stable tuning within a very short time frameAfter only about an hour they needed only slight tuning adjustment and were ready to goFirst I tried the Hybrid using a clean acoustic setting and the string produced a surprisingly nice range of sound especially in the lower registers This was a bit unexpected because of the bright label on the package I actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus The highs were clean and brightUsing the Bernard Butler setting on the Line 6 Amp I tried the electric side of the HybridThe action of the strings was light and fast and notes could be comfortably bent The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar which leads me to my closing pointOverall I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around 3 DAddario EXL110s will be put in my Best Buy category for future purchases Great value strings for electric and hybrid guitars,positive
This tuner has a bright backlight a padded clipit rotates pivots does flats and calibration from 440Hz to 438Hz Simple to use Runs on one CR 2032 pancake batteryincluded Whats not to like 5 stars all the way I have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench They have been very dependable and easy on batteries This one goes in a case for a tele copy that I just finishedAdditional Edit 03202013This particular unit does not respond a quickly as other identical tuners that I have I is accurate just doesnt respond to the string a fast I still give it 5 stars Intelli IMT500Great tuner,positive

I have quite a few mic stands and picked this up to use for micing a guitar cabinet I love the low profile and the design of the feet its very sturdy and all around better than the DR stands that I have which cost twice as much It has plenty of weight to it and enough reach to easily reach all 4 speakers in my 4x12 without becoming 34tippy3455 though it would have been nice if it shipped with more than just the single cable clip Sturdy stand at a great price,positive
I think Tortex Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged byDurable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by colorThe only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossingThen your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even betterTake a look at Cactus Picks to get an idea of what I mean Great picks Tortex Delrin are the way to go,positive
well made and the perfect length for my needs the shielding was great as well the end connectors were well made and strong quality made,positive
Ive purchased several of these in different lengths and styles and never had a problem but this one is giving me some minor difficulties with connection Like a loose connection Could be problematic,neutral
These just happen to be my favoriteI always keep 46mm 60mm and 73mm sizes on hand mostly use the 60s Ive been using them for years and so will probably never change I like the grippiness of them I hate smooth picksPicks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like picks are highly personal devices,positive
About ten years ago I installed strap locks on my first guitar Fender Stratocaster They worked well and were easy to install I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation I had to drill additional holes no two guitars Gibson SGs OuchThis made me take a second look at Schaller The components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than Dunlop It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results I went from Dunlop to Schaller,positive
I have both the Fostex PM05 MKII and the BX5a Deluxe for a while now While the BX5a tends to get higher review rating and is more popular I personally prefer the PM05 due to its having more bass volume Both models cost about the same with the PM05 roughly 20 cheaperThe PM05 is bigger heavier has a heat sink in the back with a combo XLRTRS jack While the BX5a has a bigger tweeter separate XLR TRS jacks Constructionwise both are wellmade If you plan to share the same monitor between 2 difference sources then the separate input of the BX5a is more convenient you can always get a Yadapter to support 2 inputs on the PM05The BX5a has more clarity boosted details but is more on a tinny side The PM05 has more boom but less treble I guess the difference is due to the size of the tweeter and the length of the bass port the BX5a has larger tweeter 1 rear bass port while the PM05 has 2 front bass ports Sounds coming out of the PM05 resemble more of the ambience of my car home stereo than the BX5aFor my homestudio purpose I like the warmer sound of the PM05 more I do use them to watch movie once in a while and the PM05 is more suitable as the main speakers while the BX5a is better placed for surround speakersFor further references I have placed audio samples of a song I wrote arranged so there wont be any copyright violation issue rerecorded with an AKG C414B condenser mic placed at same height as the tweeter normalized to 15dB Hope theyll help making your choice easier instead of having to buy both like I did Comparison between BX5a Deluxe Fostex PM05 MKII,positive
Most of the time I am able to use the G7 capo with one hand when moving it adjusting it and clamping it in place However sometimes I have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings dont buzz That may seem like not such a big deal but I prefer to have an easier one to work with I have small hands and an old carpal injury so I prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo This one is better than the any of the clasping kinds Keysers etc in that respect After a couple of playing sessions I figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time Now that Ive learned how best to use it Ill keep it When I first got it I was upset that I had to use 2 hands and forcible squeezing to put in place but now Ive learned how to work it better so that I can do most of it with one hand without too much strainA capo should be easy to remove and put on stay in tune not hurt the hands no 2 handed squeezing not interfere with playing when inserted and it shouldnt break too soon have at least several months to a year before breaking if at allOn the plus side this unit seems pretty well made so it should last a long time I think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodicallyIve tried so many capos now and the only ones I liked were the Planet Waves screw tops they are easy to use easy to move from fret to fret light on the hands stay in tune and out of the way but they break in damp California weather Ive had 4 of them break on me within a couple months They snap and go airborn which is dangerous Next Ill try the Dunlop Victor capos they are screw tops similar in style to the Planet Waves Dunlop also makes the Planet Waves capos but they are made with more durable bronze so they should last longer and I hope those will be the best for me I also ordered an aluminum version of the Planet Waves in hopes it wont break like their thermoplastic ones doIf you have small hands like me and dont want to strain the hands while playing like me then that rules out the Kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos The Shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust and the springtop ones are suspect as well Thats why I like the screwtops that dont get in the way and are easy to adjust Ok I hope the Dunlop Victor will do the job for me now Ill try it next Pretty good capo but not perfect,neutral
If you want to pay for patch cables and it somehow makes you feel more secure go for it Otherwise pick these up great price and certainly gets the job done The colors fit may into your rig or perhaps you can use them strategically that feature is in incidental plus They appear to be solid and will likely last just fine get the job done,neutral
I love the Snark tuners and I own several different models They all work great and of the various models I prefer the SN2 red I got the white one because I just liked that it was a unique Amazononly model The SN13 display is like the display on the SN8 and offers lower resolution than the SN1SN2SN5 displays Still it works beautifully and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my Pearl White APX700 Its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark Snark SN13,positive
For those Martins and Sigmas as well as other guitars without a neck brace button this is the secure way to connect your strap Forget the leather shoestring clipping that comes with some straps this is secure and wont ever end up with loose ends on the first fret Nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all thats needed Just make sure your choice of strap is long enough since the distance to the neck is greater than the guitar body Doesnt improve functionality but the matching logo is a nice touch for Martin and Sigma guitars Perfect Fit,positive
Sounds a lot more than what you expect this is my 2nd Honeytone one at home one at work You can use it with batteries or with a 9V adapter it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want it also has a headphones input It gets way to distorted at high volume but come on its a 20 amp it does what it has to and does it well A Honeytone is a Honeytone,positive
I love my HD500 Got it a while back but have just started to explore its capabilities Sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website There are so many options I spend hours just experimenting and trying different things The possibilities are endless Wonderful I love it Am sure you will too ENJOY POD HD500 By Line 6,positive
I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old over 3 decades and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise I havent had an electric in years and didnt have the budget to get a Gibson so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead along with a Fender Mustang I Amp Great combination This guitar has a very sloid feel and came setup perfectly right out of the box All it needed was tuning Unlike others I didnt feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them Replaced mine with Ernie Ball Not Even Slinkys and couldnt be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds Great sustain beautiful harmonics the clean tones are warm can get nice blues tones out of it and superb thrash metal too Very versatile It does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant toThe action is extremely easy fret board has a great feel to it good width on the neck not too slinder but not too thick It just feels good in your handsThe finish on this product is very nice One thing though the pick guard is kind of a tan cream off white color not bright white as pictured but it still looks greatAlso not mentioned in the description but this does come with a 12 foot cord but its not the best quality Would recommend picking up a new one when you orderOverall this is well worth the 500 that they list as the MSRP At less than half that its a stealIf you are considering this instrument dont hesitate Quality guitar at a great price,positive
Dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasnt installed The pickguard is no biggie I actually didnt want it on there it seems oversized to me If I wanted it on there tho its got a peel off sticky back Not having a cable was kinda a big deal I sent an email to Epiphone Gibson got a response within a day and after sending in proof of purchase they promised to send me a cable Nice customer serviceAs far as the Uke the finish on mine was perfect no blemishes I can see I did change out the strings and it does sound a little better I suppose but not that much Probably would have messed around on the stock strings a bit longer but I listened to the reviews and did a change right away For 100 if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well Nice Uke Had a problem that was taken care of quickly,positive

EXCELLENT Guitar Stand I use it to cradle my Electric Guitar it works beautifully Easy to to find my guitar when I want it and easy to rest it when Im done All you have to do is find a less traveled corner and the problem is solved Before this Stand I used to have to hang the EGuitar which is a risk because Electric guitars are heavy and a pain in the neck because I had to lift and aim to hang which way too much effort after one is done playing for 2 or 3 hours Excellent Guitar Stand Good Christmas Gift Idea,positive
These little patch cables work nicely theres no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fineIm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5 The product description says 6 inches right If you jump over to these psc1 planet waves patch cables theyre listed at 5 feet same as 6 inches right The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back upTo conclude would I recommend these Yes if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable go for these But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else Does the job,positive
Got these as a gift for my 11 year old nephew he loves them the only problem is that his friends keep walking off with them nice picks,positive
I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops and boy am I amazed Every straplock system Ive used in the past on friends guitars semipermanently mounted the strap to the guitar often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim In contrast these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off its great Better still the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes making installation trivial And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch using the posts like the OEM ones This is a great system and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar What a fantastic way to secure a guitar,positive
Ive been using Sennheisers for years and while I am very pleased with them I decided to try the ATHM50Ss on a whim I spent a little more 50 than what Ive been paying for the Sennies but it was well worth it I get more of a flat response which is exactly what I needed for monitoring my audio mixesAnd a trivial bonus a straight cord I hate coiled cords Replaced my Sennies,positive
This could be a great mic and is similar to the Shure SM58 But Ive found that most of these pyle pro audio products tend to have a much higher signal to noise ratioeven plugged into my best preamps in studio Spend more money get some quality mics These are only good for garage practice on a budget High SN Ratio,neutral
This is simply one of the best pedal boards out there It is very well made resistant tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape Looks good too I would recommend to get a few roles of powergrip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcro included especially if you have a combination of both regular size MXR or Boss and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby or a VOX Satchurator or TimeMachine Reverb If thinking of purchasing one of these you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized Now if you are on the road for long I would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case For eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok Great board,positive

ListenIf you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability buy this one PeriodI bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work in case the guys called for a practice session so I wouldnt have to go all the way home to pick up my gearI have other way more expensive guitars like a Gibson ES335 Dean 12 string and a Fender Strat but I gotta tell you I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others No kiddingAnd if it gets banged up so what It costs a buck thirty Buy another In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes just for a cheap change up guitarDig it Sweet little G,positive
I have never been let down by Ernie Ball strings They produce a bright clear sound and for every other string in their price range they are the best way to go I only use them and I have been playing for a decadeThey stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle stringsWhenever I buy a new guitar and change out the factory strings I am always shocked at how much better my instrument sounds Excellent Bright Sound,positive
If youre not familiar with EHXs signature distortionfuzz pedal the Big Muff please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out Describing its sound with words helps but doesnt really do it justice It definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while youll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on handTheyre one of my very favorite effects honestly So for this review Im going to focus more on how the Little Big Muff stacks up against the other modelsFor starters this version takes care of ALL of the common complaints regarding the NYC reissue1 Its true bypass2 Its much smaller not super tiny like a Boss but a little slimmer than say the wider MXR pedals like the Phase 1003 It uses a normal 9v adapter jack thank you finally4 It sounds betterYes it indeed SOUNDS better than the NY Reissue Some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has This one is smoother Not as creamy as the Russians but it also doesnt suck tone like that one does either Its a touch higher gain than both the Russians and the Tone Wicker versions but all in all it absolutely is a Big MuffSo if youre in the market for one of these and you dont want the options the Tone Wicker Muff provides this is absolutely where its at Its better in every way than the NY ReissueAlso it costs less money Yay Better than the reissue,positive
It comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy They come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective Great price as well Lifetime Guarantee,positive
Right out of the box the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved Next I proceeded to adjust the intonation I was able to get the intonation for the A D G B and highE strings spot on However after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharpI also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high lowE string tension loose bridge which would definitely contribute to the defective lowE string intonationI love the Red Burst design of this guitar it looks absolutely WICKED Unfortunately Im going to have to return it Im going to get a Squier Strat instead with either aMapleorRosewoodneckUpdate November 15 2013I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago but it was placed on backorder I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldnt get it back in stock until December Then to my surprise the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday Yay D The happinessI was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated Its Red Burst like the Legacy Fender calls it Antique Burst Its a beautful guitar and and Im loving it Crooked Bridge Causes Defective Low E String Intonation,negative
this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp seems well built and rugged although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace great for those looking to mic up their guitar amp,positive
Mixed my bands album with these headphones the sound quality is impressive in all ranges and they have a very respectable bass response Theyre also great for drum practice as they block out the loudness of the drums so I can hear my metronome perfectly Theyre also awesome for live recording use as a monitor I will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future Superior sound quality,positive
Now this is one GREAT piece of kit Two chanels 60 watts RMS real power and super control over the sound of each channel Only complaint ITS BUHTUGLY Sickly brown cheesy looking If she was my prom date Id put a sack over her head yeah well not that Im another George Clooney or anything The Bees Knees,positive

great set of strings I will stick with elixir strings whether it be electric or acoustic great brand and they know what they are doing Elixir,positive
Ive been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as Ive been playing guitar twenty one years now I find the 60s are just a bit too thin but for more chord strumming style playing such as playing rhythm the 73s are perfect They are flexible but not flimsy The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all youll get with a pristine tip However theyre definitely still usable after that One other advantage these picks have is that they never break So i dont see how you can go wrong I use these picks for standard chord strumming,positive
So first up Ive been using Macs to record music since the G4 Cube yeah go look that up Anyway I know my way around audio recording on Apple devicesAnd then yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsyBUT I havent encountered anything so Plug Play simple as the Apogee JAM 96k since Gefen introduced the iMic Just plug in the USB or Lightning cable plug in your instrument and GOAlso its not flimsy It is made of plastic but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my deskIt pulls power from your machine so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings This also helps those of us using electric guitars that dont have extrawound humbuckersI tested the Apogee JAM on a new 2014 MacBook Air an iPhone 5 and a 2013 iPad Mini Garageband instantly knew what was going on but ProTools did need a bit of coachingA small device that doesnt color input sound and doesnt get in the way just what I needed Works great and better than expected,positive
I have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter Most stages in bars clubs and restaurants are small enough to use 25 mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake but not all These GLS Audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the 2 months that I have been using them on an almost daily basis I have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon Stages can be wide,positive
Bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on YouTube Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd So it was something that was necessary and not waste of money or an unwanted item Also i dont really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends so now i can listen through my speakers Perform live at parties and My mom can now sing karaoke,positive
I didnt need anything high dollar so this was just what I needed Does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units Ive used Works Great For My Needs,positive
While this is not a 300 tape delayits a solid pedal that gets it done Its way better built than other pedals in this price range Im sold Ive purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals Great pedal for the money,positive
Mics are like pants you have to find the right fit This one I like for my vocals live I sing fairly low and airy works great for me Also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live very sweet sound I prefer it to the 58 seems a bit more bright and natural Might purchase another one eventually Like it,positive
I was looking for something more solid than the usual fold up stand and this is it I can put a heavy notebook full of music on it and a lamp and a tray and more stuff and it is rock solid Very happy Very solid,positive

This microphones quality is amazing I just hooked it up to my PC Windows 7 and it worked no hassle whatsoever Nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great I recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises The stand that comes with it is very stable but it is low to the ground or in this case desktable so it may pick up some unwanted background noise computer fans mouse clicksmovement etc Great Quality,positive
I like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum A work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin They must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required But you must be careful I tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge Not Remos fault but it is something to pay attention to Remo quality and sound,positive
Good strings with good soundThe Extra Light is easier on the fingers but they sound thinner tooGo for the Light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure Good I like it,positive
Good basic strap Its not fancy but it doesnt need to be By being just plain black it tends not to detract from the good looks of the five string bass its used on Does the trick,positive
Excellent Sound qualityVery functional and easy to work withSmall enough to take alongIt is my most used Gear in my life right now I dont want anything else Excellent overall value,positive
Hey its a fun little toy but Ive seen this thing going in most places for an even 100 which is ridiculous I was lucky enough to get it on Amazon for 80 Once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust Ive made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but its not one of those tools youll use every song unless youre so amazing you can make it work every song Learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun but once you get it and youre over it you wonder why you wasted 100 on something that shouldnt have cost more than 50 Its essentially a 9V battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light This was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when I had nothing better to use my money on Cool but dont pay more than 50 for it,neutral
i originally wanted the Boss DD but after doing a side by side demo i decided that im not Buckethead and dont need a 150 dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then I have the Berhinger Reverb Machine and HellBabe and they do equal if notno they do equal to my Boss counterparts Especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isnt stock Boss i wouldnt take these on the road or anything without 3 or 4 backups but for recording and doing demos Behinger is the way to go timed effects wise anyway they are made of plastic after all Awesome little thing for the price,positive
These are great cables for connecting effects pedals and I love that they have a little color both for fun better organization To top it all off the price is right Cheers Great pedal cables with a splash of color,positive
Noisy as any compressor but after using it I dont wanna go back to not having one for my setup Cool,positive
WOW is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 stringEndless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers PK,positive
I was looking for a pedal that didnt take my lifes savings and still performed well I found it right here it works well with no problems to report next week Ill purchase another with a different feature It also arrived super fast Needed some Distortion,positive
This was a good purchase My son has discovered guitars and music and when he needed strings Amazon was his goto place to buy them He found exactly what his guitar needed and at a good price Hes very happy with this purchase DAddario EXL 116 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings Medium TopHeavy,positive
This guitar is pretty good for the price The only reason it has 4 stars is because my first and 2nd string keep detuning Might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in DADGAD I think I may need to tighten some screws Anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical Pretty good,positive
Bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesnt cost much I just attached it to an existing adapter and voila When you need it this comes handy,positive
I have owned this product for a while now it has some awesome features This little Recorder is absolutely amazing for its size Takes some practice to appreciate all the features I recommended this Recorder to a fellow musician friend he bought one also from Amazon he loves it records all his gigs with it now instead of the old huge unit he was using told me it does a much better job than his old unit He even used his on a tripod to record a gravesite funeral service that his family can keep for memories of a loved one Zoom H2 Portable Recorder,positive
it works got on time I am happy it works,positive
According to the ad copy this pedal replicates FullStack Marshall crunchAs the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just thatWhat Im loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like Dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up Its responsive to your picking attack its distortion is very very harmonically rich and it does give you a Marshall type sound good boost in the mids and bass giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous forSad to say it actually does the fullstack thing better than my ProCo Rat which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal The Rat is fantastic and I have no plans to sell mine dont get me wrong but the Crunch Distortion can get the raging fullstack tones the Rat can but has a tighter bottom end less noise and a more open sound than the Rat Individual notes ring out great on the Crunch Distortion Its a great pedal period Its a darn guitar miracle at 40As a side point I play lots of Ramones stuff and this pedal more than any other gives me that awesome Johnny Ramone tone I was running my goldtop with P90s into this pedal then into the sparkling clean 65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II this pedal plays well with modeling amps which is a rarity let me tell you and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone better than Ive ever got with my Rat my Boss DS1 DS2 HM2 ANYTHING else Ive owned and Ive owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years This is the pedal that finally did it it just nails that cranked 70s Marshall stack soundMy hats off to Joyo They made a fantastic distortion one of the very best Ive ever played and theyre practically giving it away Buy one youll use it youll love it youll be happy you bought it A truly fantastic pedal,positive
Not sure that title is good grammar but anyway I have gotten so much use out of my H2 Im a music teacher and I have recorded music classes and performing groups Being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye and ear opening for those kidsIt is very easy to use The various recording quality settings are useful so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more spacesaving mp3 settingYou can record stereo from just in front of the unit or you can turn on 4way allaround recordingIve used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments I often record one part of a duet then play along with itYou can do some editing on the unit but its easier to download the track and use some software to do it I have gone direct to disk though just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end which is some of the editing you can do on the H2There is little to fault with it It takes a while to rename a track for instance but there again you could do it on your desktop after you downloadPrior to this I had a Sony minidisc recorder which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time I bought it I finally got tired of messing with discsI am very glad I got the H2 Great for every application Ive put it to,positive
it does whats its suppose to do holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get works very well Mic Clip not much to it,positive
If you are fan of the Jazz III you will definitely like the Ultex version From my experience the Ultex has the sound and feel of Tortex but without the memory aka wear The Ultex is thicker than the standard nylong Jazz IIIs and only when directly compared will you notice that the Ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surfaceFive stars for being a better Jazz III However the prices for these on amazon are absurd I got mine through musiciansfriend for around 2 shipped My favorite Jazz III absurdly priced,positive
A must for every serious guitar player This is one of the easiest to use slides that I have ever owned I have been playing for about 45 years I play mostly classic rock this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar caseThis holds up very well because I have a way of abusing a slide Dunlop does it again Slide,positive
Ive bought quite a few tuners over the years These are small responsive easy to read and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference These are greatAt first I was turned off by the toyish appearance but decided to try it after reading the reviews Let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics and they perform way better than I expected Best tuner Ive bought,positive
This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for Its quality outweighs its price Lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable But the quality of these cables can vary greatly I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home With nothing changed but the cable there was a significant difference in quality and volume So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised The quality appears good The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential Ive seen more expensive cables and this one is so far greatHosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft Good quality great price,positive
I bought this little pedal back in 1996 about a year after I got my first guitar Ive tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound Its very versatile and its really easy to dial in just about any sound I want You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units but for cost and practicality this pedal is your best bet Been part of my rig since 1996,positive
A very nice pick both in feel and texture the design is a bit boring though Only complaint is that its fairly small about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a 25 cent piece But thats okay I got this the same time as I got a set of Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks and I think I like the Dava picks the best All three are 34tight grip34 picks and all the same size theyre all good though Id rate this one nextbest and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that Great pick with a nice tight grip excellent strumming a bit small though about as big as a nickel,positive
Sticks are well organized and always in reach This is a musthave item for drummers and the wellorganized It fits the set perfectly and is quite practical Perfect Fit,positive
This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft tall Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future Excellent Strap,positive
I use to protect my microphones of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone very good product I recommend protects your microphones,positive
I lost a recordingrehearsal space I shared with some musician friends when it burned down from an electrical fire during superstorm Sandy late last year A total loss and we had no insurance we sure learned our lessonSo we rented a new space this time its nowhere near the shore and we are rebuilding Were starting from scratch and little odds and ends like guitar hangers add up after a while its bad enough we had a number of instruments amps and other equipment to replace So if we can save a few bucks here and there it helpsI bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good After I tried it and it worked fine I went back and bought another 9 of them We have guitars basses ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them they work on all sizes We use those widethreaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall Like I said theyre nothing fancy but they get the job done Not fancy but they do the job,positive
This little gem is worth its weight in gold So easy to tune with it We have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong Automatic shutoff helps too A MustHave,positive

This product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar My fretboard hasnt been cleanedoiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry The cleaner removed visible grime the polish cloth shined up the frets but most importantly the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel I am very pleased with the product The truth about this product,positive
I bought two sets this is a great why if to keep your strap on your guitar if you still what to keep everything stock Love this,positive
Its about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards Its fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job its supposed to do You can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable It has a switch to change between Bass and Guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on 5 string basses or 7 string guitarsIt also has a button to tune it down lower 5 half steps so you can do some alternate tunings tooLastly it has a button for 34Sound34 so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually The display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the LCD screen to show if its flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have troubleIt comes with 2 AAA batteries I have no idea how long theyll last yet but I have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later A small but handy tuner,positive
I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up dial it in and play it for a while I edited yet again as someone didnt appreciate my gloating over other guitars I own Sorry to offend YOUI made a knee jerk review again right after I got this But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up ready to go I was comparing apples and oranges so to speak But now even after comparing them to each other they really arent that far apartThe Gibson is the best guitar Ive ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it But this little baby is now my second favoriteMy other review was NOT FAIR I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal WOWI must honestly admit the edge goes to my Gibson but not by as much as youd think This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was 149 guitar ever The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul Its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rockTo be honest I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson After all if I ding this one up I havent broke the bank I think Ill tend to use this one a lot more than the otherI am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge I may purchase another one and put it away as Im sure the price wont stay this low PLUS Ill get another one in a different color You can never have too many guitars I am going to an a pickguard to this one The finish on it is outstanding and Id like to keep it that wayIf I were thinking of learning to play the guitar this one is a nobrainerBUY ITIf youre an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar Id buy this one is a heartbeat I was shocked at how sweet it sounds how good it looks how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTICNew rule for me no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week After a proper setup 5 stars Damn nice guitar,positive
DAddarios NYXL1046 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings I have the Light are THE best Ive got them on my Fender Strat I can tune my guitar and play it for a couple hours and still not have it go out of tune Even if Im using the tremolo bar and bending strings these things stay in tune When I get together with other guitar players to jam I dont have to worry about being the one who has to keep tuning my guitar A couple Ernie Ball die hards are about ready to jump ship and get on the DAddario Line after seeing mine in actionI can put my Strat aside pick it up to play a few days later and its still in tune Doesnt happen when I pick up my other electric that dont have these strings on it yet Either Im going to have to put these on my other electric or the Fender is going to be my baby who gets all the play time with MamaIve never used strings that bend so well And they dont cut into my fingers as much when playing for extended periods of time These are miracle strings in my mindMost importantly they sound GREATGood going DAddario Stay In Tune Better,positive
This amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers and name on an old card and give guitar picks at the same time The edges are a little rough but it is a punch not a precision cutter One of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed What to do with old credit cards,positive
This is my second after breaking the last ones neck The plastic socket around the ball socket joint couldnt take the stress in the gig bag Ill keep this one by the music stand My second SN2,positive
This electric guitar padded bag is exactly what I wanted The price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched The pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig Very costeffective Great price Great guitar bag,positive
These are my favorite strings They last a long time and my fingers dont hurt when I play I tried Martin strings once and hated them Wouldnt use anything else,positive
After purchasing many kinds of attachments to amplify my mandolin or fiddle with little or no satisfaction I ordered this little mic I didnt expect much considering the price It works so great I ordered a few more Clip it into the guitar sound hole or on the head stock or on the mandolin head stock or on the fiddleeach time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky The cord is long enough for me to stand and move around some while I play that is a GREAT bonus for me Cant believe the natural sounds from my acoustic instruments,positive
Nice quality fretboard oil Has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way I would definitely recommend this Worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard Awesome,positive
I bought this hoping it would be a nofrills looper and thats what I got It sounds great and the level adjustment works really well I can layer even as many as 10 or 12 layers and hear every one without problem I give this five stars but I have two minor quibbles that in my mind dont take away from the rating but might be important to some1 there is no included power supply If it doesnt take batteries thats fine but give me an adapter This thing was over a hundred dollars Dont force me to buy an accessory just to power it up2 Personally I wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added not just removing the last layer or all the layers Id like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer moving to a crescendo and then back off the layers one at a time eventually returning to a single layer I played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it I started with one part and then added layer after layer until I had a really big intricate sound It would have been nice to be able to then take it back down to a single part and then quietly end the songThis is a wonderful little looper You wont be disappointed a great value,positive
As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently but my heart wasnt really in it so I took up the guitar which I love I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom and have tried several picks in that quest There are several I have liked and several that I havent but thus far my favorite is the 10mm Tortex blue picks They have a very nice almost powdery matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just dont break though the 10s are fairly stiff Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences I wont say that I will never try anything else but thus far I find myself picking up my 10 Tortex more than other picks Durable And Dont Slip Whats Not To Love,positive
Nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls Gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot A pick is pick theres no doubt about that but a little art work sort gives it a personality And I dont play Hawiian Guitar,positive
Ive been a musician for over 40 years Ive seen an awful lot of products come and go I dont get excited about the latestandgreatest very easily but having said that this is the best idea in headstock tuners I have encountered I bought one and found it so useful I ordered two more Planet Waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff This item is definitely in the good quality family Its easy to read outdoors in the daylight yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light Great design Planet Waves Excellent price GODPS This is undoubtedly the best headstock tuner Ive ever owned,positive
These stands are great for my lesson business I bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight Nice stands,positive
These are good picks Ive tried all the other gel picks and plastic picks The gel picks come closeBut these are great Because I have Dexterity Problems and the plasticrubber grip Is perfectI do still have a little Trouble with controlled the pick and droping the pick but they definitely do helpI def Do recommend these to anyone who was deceasedbad dexterity good picks,positive
This system works just okay Try to turn it up and you get bad feedbackMy microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from themThey couldnt give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one or where I could even buy a replacementVery frustrating Dont break your mic,negative
Ive read the revues and some dont do them justice These fit very well do the job theyre supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar just use a cordless drill to attach them make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit Work Well,positive
This pedal does exactly what it says its supposed to It boosts the guitars signal It does it really well with very little to no noise The thing I like most is that it is not a sledge hammer type pedal or overdrive The input signal is cleanly boosted What you put into the input comes out the same only louder It starts with no change in the signal and allows you to raise up the gain very slowly It just gives the signal from your guitar a stronger output to whatever you are plugging into amp mixer effects or pedal board This pedal arrived at my door on a Friday afternoon so I took it to a gig that night without trying it first something I dont normally do The first two times I used this pedal were that night Friday and the next Saturday I thought it worked great for my needs A few days later I read a review that said this pedal had a noticable hiss Since I didnt remember hearing any I got it out at home and plugged it into my amp I have the same amp at home that I use live When you activate it with the tone set flat on the pedal and the volume about 1200 there is a very sight hiss no noise when bypassed For me it is a very minor hiss that in live situations with all the normal room noises I never heard at all This may not be true for all amps and maybe some high gain input amps may handle this signal differently I know for sure it is a lot quieter than almost any effects pedal I have ever owned and I have box full from 35 years of playing I am using a Vox VT30 which is a modeling amp with lots of bulit in effects delays chorus flanger compressors etc These days I dont use any additional outboard effects except a BBA Sonic Stomp that I never turn off so siganl from my guitar hits my amps input very cleanly If you use various guitars on gigs this pedal is very useful It allows me to quickly match the various guitar output levels and compensate for differences between humbuckers single coils and piezo pick ups on an acoustic without having to adjust the amp controls This is a great problem solver for any rig that needs to control the input level to the amp and it does it at a bare bones priceI have owned several Behringer pedals for live work and have some Behringer rack gear in my live audio rack and in my home studio I gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully I have never broken or had a problem with any of my Behrinnger gear including a pair of Behringer 12 powered speakers mixed with a pair of Mackie 15 powered mains I dont intentionally abuse my gear but at 200 when your packing up s happens but so far my Behringer stuff has never let me down yet and I have had some it for many years I also keep reading about people worrying about the hard plastic cases on Behringer pedals Dont worry about it They are sturdy enough Just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage The battery goes under the pedal switch and the spring that is under the foot switch will probbaly fall out if you are not careful To open the battery compartmentfoot switch cover just use a pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver and push in the black pins on either side of the pedal Does just what I want and does it well,positive
This is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars Adjust your volume of the main mix and adjust your instrumentmic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds Perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for 34more me34 in their monitor You can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want Say hello to the more me box,positive

This rack stand is made up of a heavy steel and welded together very well I received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under 5 minutes My audio equipment mounted easily with the 48 INCLUDED mounting screws and everything looks great and I dont have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over It is very sturdy and very stable I recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to 12 audio or networking devices I will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once I fill this one up I will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly High Quality Product,positive
Try to get the version wthe black cabinet for around 300 as thats what most major music stores are charging In any case I was really looking more for a twin 12 speaker to pair with an amp head but those can cost as much if not more than this comboThe clean side of the amp is exactly that very very clean This amp has tons of power to spare In your house you do not have or want to turn it up beyond 3 Cant even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like I have my own separate effects stomp box so I can let this amp sound like almost ANYTHING The big plus here is that unlike with real tube amps that need to be cranked up pretty much to get the right sound here you can have it set on 2 and still get pretty much any amp sound I am using a ZOOM MS50G All in all hard to beat for practice session as well as small to mid size gigs Only thing I miss a bit is a headphone jack A steal when offered for about 300,positive
The Intelli IMT500The tuner that killed the IntellitouchThere are scores of chromatic tuners on the market Most work by using a small builtin microphone that picks up sound waves In order to be used effectively the tuning space must be relatively quiet Many of these tuners have input jacks that allow electric guitars to be connected directly and tuned by the electronic signal they produce A bunch of years ago a variety of cliponmicrophones began to be marketed The microphone could be clipped to any instrument and its cord attach to an electronic tuner Now anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noiseThen the Intellitouch tuner hit the market The entire tuner clipped onto the instrument One could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment There was no cord to deal with and the instrument could stay clipped to the headstock or quickly removed and slid into a pocket or case Talk about convenience Jams and festivals bluegrass folk whatever became seas of Intellitouch tunersIntellitouch owned the market even though there were so many situations where they did not work well In particular they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars The more overtones an instrument produces the worse the tuner behaves The bass string of a Martin rosewood dreadnought was near impossible to tune without using one of the many workarounds that owners developed So it was very much a lovehate relationship The shortcomings were huge but the convenience meant that they were toleratedThen came the Intelli It was an Intellitouch that worked if not perfectly then a whole lot better The amazing thing is that the switch from Intellitouch to Intelli wasnt gradual Within six months of its introduction jams and festivals became seas of Intelli tuners People were throwing their Intellitouches into drawers if they werent lucky enough to find a die hard holdout willing to buy one secondhand to get the Intelli Thats a considerable investment to abandon But why not The Intelli is half the price of the Intellitouch and works a whole lot better They are so inexpensive that its easy to justify getting one for the practice area and one for the case so that you dont have to worry about forgetting to pack itAnyone who will ever have to tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment will quickly find this tuner indispensable And it works darn well in a quiet environment tooHighly recommended Finally Amazon offers the Intelli IMT500,positive
Old tech bungee type of capo Inexpensive and works well You have to remember that banjos dont have a lot of tension on the neck to they really dont require a vice to get the job done Works well on Mandolins too Old Tech Works Great,positive
With all the other great reviews noted here I decided to buy this guitar Had a Rogue 12 string a few years ago and sold it as I was not that impressed with it What a difference with the Epiphone The fit finish speaks quality Playabilty is very good with low action and good tone Really is a great buy Very Satisfied,positive
its good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price ok pick holder,negative
Been a fan of these for years now I occasionally use other strings for fun but these will always be my go to strings every time They feel great on the fingers for such a long period of time sliding is easy and they keep their tone forever it seems like I recommend these to everyone I talk to who plays guitar and they always stick with em GET EM You wont be sorry Get em,positive
I own a mobile DJ company and have 4 ultimate TS90 stands and im really not happy with them This product is simple does the job and is well priced They are a little heavy at 9 lbs per stand but i like the look and operation of them Ive been happy with them so far Great stand for the price,positive
The MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay is a relative newcomer on the pedal scene but has become instantly beloved by professional semiprofessional and amateur guitarists alike I would be in the latter category As a longtime user of the Boss DD3 Digital Delay it was a bit jarring trying out the Carbon Copy But after playing with the controls a bit and appreciating the pure quality of the tone it produces it quickly won me overThere isnt a great way to explain the difference between digital and analog delay other than to say that the former is more precise and percussive while the latter provides more warmth and ambience The Mod button is suppose to add additional modulation to the tone though I dont hear a dramatic difference But no matter what setting you use there is something undeniably more real about the delay effect of the Carbon Copy versus other delays I have used Rather than repeat your notes verbatim it almost sounds like a haunting middle ground between the reverbecho effect of a large hall and digital delayThe range of this delay fortunately is quite wide I believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds To give you some perspective on that slapback delays such as rockabilly Stray Cats echo are very short probably under 150 milliseconds Rhythmic U2 delays are usually around 350450 ms Then theres even longer delays with a lot of repeats a la Pink Floyds David Gilmour This pedal is capable of all of those though the U2 style delay is better achieved with digital One note on that though whereas the DD3 uses three different knob range settings to cover its delay time everything from 20600 ms is covered with one sweep of the Carbon Copys knob This makes it very convenient but also a bit touchyTo summarize the Carbon Copy is outstanding alternative to digital delay and at an attractive price point It covers the sounds of delay pedals over twice as large and expensive and belongs on any delay aficionados pedalboard An instant classicinspired by a classic effect,positive
When Im in a apt I need an amp with tube at least the pre and a cabinetOrange PPC108 1x8 Speaker Cabinetas small as possible giving a decent sound and output wo annoying around and Orange made my needs trueI never ever expect to play at a stadium with this ObviouslyIn my opinion this is absolutely a decent Amp that respond to precise needs This sounds good,positive
Ive wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently Dont know if their QC has gone downhill or what I didnt send them back because theyre usually around 10 but its disconcerting when a Fender product unexpectedly fails It would have 5 stars but for the recent failures I like these and have used them in countless guitars but there are better out there,neutral
I have a LOT of pedals including many delays and echosThe MXR is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my Aqua Puss EH Delux Memory Boy Ibanez Boss and lets not even get into the Behringer stuff I like the choruslike mod button Very lush and sweet to listen too Not as feature rich as some of my other delays but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me Simple to use compact and well built I like using this clean but even its ability to take some distortion is pretty goodThis is simliar to my favorite echo the Morely ECV from the 70s in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it Lush is the right wordHope this helps one of the better ones,positive

The previous reviewer obviously got a defective case The case I got works incredibly well and always keeps the guitar well protected and my back comfortable while carrying it It has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too Id recommend it to anyoneEDIT Ive had 3 good years with this bag and it has still yet to rip on me Works really well,positive
This is so darn cool It shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune And it works on so many instruments AWSOME,positive
This is a pretty awesome pedal especially if youre going for more of an 80s or 90s metal sound thats more chunky and defined than fizzy Think earlier Mesa models like the famous Mark III C that was used by Metallica on the Master of Puppets album Of course no pedal can perfectly replicate that sound but the Metal Muff does a pretty amazing impressionSome of the best aspects of the Metal Muff include1 Great clarity and definition even on higher gain settings Seriously most high gain pedals cause you to lose a lot of definition in your playing but the metal muff doesnt do that So especially for the lead guitarist this should be a major selling point2 Wide range to the tone controls With some pedals its really hard to hear a difference when you adjust the tone controls but not so with the metal muff You can easily dial in the sound youre after or maybe even find a new sound you like even better3 The quality of construction is absolutely superb Everything about the pedal is rugged and durable Id feel totally comfortable gigging without a backupOn a different note Ive only used this pedal with my Fender Hotrod tube amp and it sounds great However I prefer the Rocktron Zombie pedal to the Metal Muffsee my review of the Zombie for more info on that However the Rocktron Zombie doesnt sound good through solid state amps I mention this because if youre using a tube amp I honestly feel that the Zombie is a better option But if youre playing through a solid state amp the Ive read that the metal muff still shines Just something to considerTo conclude this pedal is awesome if youre looking for a pedal to give an allround good straightup metal sound Sure its a bit of a onetrick pony but its a pretty good trick If youre looking for an ultra highgain distortion monster then look else where but otherwise I recommend giving the Metal Muff a look An awesome pedal for playing metal,positive
For 99 you get the best good sized heavy duty high quality amp with tons of SOUNDConstruction Solid good material and parts Fender used the good stuffSound Nice clear LOUD sound especially for an 8 speaker and 20W amp You can definitely jam with a drummer no problem or just shred it wearing headphonesEffects There are 9 amp models ie 57 deluxe metal 2000 etc and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp modelsThe effects include chorus deep chorus flange tremelo vibration phaser step filter delay 150ms 300ms 700ms Reverb large hall small room echo filter octaver etcSo what are the presets Each of the 9 amp models has been preprogrammed with three different presets meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best soundsWhen you select a preset like the first metal 2000 for example the minute you touch the gain knob the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set Same with treble bass volume and all other effects The moment you touch any dials or effects knobs you have custom control to tweak each preset just temporarily or save it if you wishIts so great because often I feel I would have made a present slightly more this or that simply grab the gain or change the treble or move from delay to reverb and make it your own Very easyEase of use Plug in your guitar spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects Plug in ipod or computer with 35mm male cable Its that easyPC Software Ive heard their is trouble installing mine said error and did not install on Windows 7 I know there are ways to fix this and I will do so when I have some time Comes with a USB cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer Works for mac or PC get more presets use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer Play on guitar rig and amplitude AwesomeSize Perfect Big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel Small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc Looks like 18x18 to me The front metallooking grill is mesh but quality and looks greatTuner Super simple Doesnt tell you which note is in tune just tells you left right or green in center for in tuneAll in all when compared to the Line 6 Spider and many other fender amps this one has the quality sound the dozens of different effect combinations input for a footswitch aux for ipod and USB for computer It has it all I jam through headphones for hours each day since I bought it The reverb and gain distortion are so clean and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone My guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender ampDont sleep on this its 99 for a loud quality amp with 1000s worth of effects peddles built inAnd did I mention EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE so easy I could teach a 5 year old Select a preset change the dials you want to change make changes permanent only by hitting save otherwise presets stay the way the factory made themLOVE THIS AMP and Ive shopped EVERY comparable model This is the one hands down worth a minimum of 150Louder than my friends 60WD ONE LOVE FENDER MUSTANG YOU ROCK Awesome Let me break it down,positive
Ive used this stand for about two years now and it held up great It does what its supposed to do and for the price its one of the best thank you and guess what in amazone you can find it much cheaper than music store nice stand,positive
Very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic It hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out Great for back up singers good fit,neutral
I bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful outoftune twang with my previous Planet Waves capo when I would try to reset the capo on a different fret Planet Waves capos are awesome dont get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully Great capo for acoustic guitar,positive
Ive used Hosa for years they have never let me down All their cords are quit and are quality produces I have never had a Hosa go bad on me It does its job well,positive
This product is not what it seems It has a cool name but thats about it Its a tool oil that stinks I tried my best to get use to this product but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time After doing away with the FastFret my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty I now use Old English and my guitars thank me my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me You will too Not For Serious Players,negative
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you I will get another for my monitor Jazzgyrl52,positive
Very good for a quick tune up Might be a little to tight for checking intonation Very fast readout and fast on off Easy to use,positive
This thing has so many uses its ridiculous I mostly use it to record live band rehearsals and its pretty amazing at that Ive also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a USB interface for my DAW when my other interface went kaput If you are using this for film music field recording you will be very happy Easy to use interface and very well constructed Amazing,positive
I agree with all the other reviews These are high quality sounding very comfortable I have a big head too durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack Unless you make money with your headphones or have money to burn you probably dont need anything better than the M50s The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans they make the headphones take up less room when folded good for travelling but Im old fashioned and prefer rigid phones they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you dont have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation No big deal though Comes with nice screw on 18 to 14 adaptor High quality headphones reasonable price,positive
I was expecting a soso mike for the price boy was I surprised This mike is great One thing I did notice was that if it wasnt fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing other than that it works great WOW,positive
Almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials Can double as a mic or boom stand The boom attachment is very easily adjustable but also very sturdy when you lock it down Wasnt disappointed The connecting parts of the mic standboom are 58 inch male size so make sure whatever youre buying this product with can connect to that my shock mount had 38in female connector If not just invest about 6 into an adapter like I did Very solid,positive
Fast Fret or at least some kind of string cleaner is a must have for anyone who plays guitar Because if you think about it strings get really dirty over time and this product solves that issue YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH GHS FAST FRET,positive
Over the years Ive tried literally dozens of capos While some have been better than others Ive never had one I was completly happy with string buzz hard to place without being out of tune too firm not firm enough etc So far the Planet Waves NS TriAction Capo is the best one Ive ever triedat least in the short term Its worked equally well on my acoustic my electric It works on my octave mandolin and even though its designed for 6 strings on my Rickenbacker 12 string Hopefully it will give years of faithful service for the quality is reasonably priced At this point I give it 2 thumbs up Recommended Never been happy,positive
I was looking for a cleaner and a polisher to get the grease and grime off my guitars I decided to trythe Dunlop Formula 65 Polish Cleaner I thought why not try a 2 in 1 formulation After all thereare shampoo and conditioners in one bottle and that works well for me So why not this Possiblyfaulty logic but I went with it at the timeWell I have to say that it did well I used a soft cotton cloth placed some Formula 65 on the clothNot the guitar and slowly worked on the more oily looking areas of my Gibson ES339 This guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish The Dunlop Polisher Cleaner did a very good job on thefinish and did not leave any streaks behindIt was after using the substance all over the guitar that I realized that one must not get Formula 65in any cracks or chips I am thankful that I did not have any of said cracks or chips I am usually oneto read directions thoroughly but not this time No harm done but I will make it a point to inspect myguitars for cracking or chipping prior to using Formula 65 againThis stuff works well It was able to lift off with some effort greasy buildup over the last year I amnot a messy person but oily hands can and often leave smudges that mar the surface of the finish Notonly does it clean up the oils from my hands and gosh knows what else it also left a nice shine as wellThe finish looks very good This 4oz bottle will go a long way It doesnt take much to workI tried using an untreated microfiber polish cloth and that only pushed the oily mess around That iswhen I decided to get the Dunlop Polisher Cleaner It definitely worked a lot easier than the untreated microfiber cloth I am now using the microfiber cloth to rub off any new smudges as theyoccur I plan to reapply the cleanerpolisher when I oil my fret board a couple times a yearI gave the Formula 65 Cleaner Polisher 412 stars due to the fact you can potentially do damage toyour guitar Chips and cracks do occur throughout the course of a guitars life and can be expectedalbeit not wanted So 412 stars because it does what it says it will do but youve got to be carefulusing it Sobe careful out there peopleNOTE There is a California Propositon 65 Warning on the web page under Product Details Amazonhas placed it there as a public service It reads WARNING This product contains chemicals knownto the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm Just thoughtyou ought to know 412 STARS but Watch For Cracks And Chips Dunlops Formula 65 Cleaner Polisher 4 oz bottle,positive
I am in agreement with others that state this is a musthave I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood Ive used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard I rub the entire neck down before and after I play It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop which I suspect is what they mustve been using all these years and never told me though I never did askfoolish me Since Ive recently gotten into doing my own setups where Ive read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck its less than 5 Shouldnt have waited my whole life,positive
I own several small tuners including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark In comparison to those I would say its most like the Enote when it comes to size but definitely more accurate and responsive In comparison to the Snark its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning Its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the Snark Anyway it all comes down to preference I suppose I would recommend it Pocket tuner,positive
None of the problems onoff that plague the Cry Baby Better sound too People are sold on that because of its association with Hendrix But THIS is the original and the best Obligatory The original and BEST,positive
Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option It lasts long sounds great and feels very nice It is probably the most favored pick among all companies I recommend the orange one for beginners and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well but it is totally up to what you want Either way Dunlop is the best and for a great price My Favorite Picks,positive
I have been using Hercos for for many years They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sitsFor guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness Good protection for instruments,positive
I just bought a tweed Blues Jr and love the amp Its got a great tone much better than the black one I had 34 yrs ago I just downsized from a 40 watt Blues Deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side I can say they sound very very similar as they have the same speaker but the BJ is much lighterThat being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo I was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone didnt do that on my last one This pedal works great for that too It feels very solid and it doesnt make any audible clicking noises that I can hear when engaging it Great pedal,positive
Not much to say here theyre knobs They look good are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar Good quality fit right on CTS pots,positive
Awe it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself But I did buy another that I still have but it is still in its original packaging as a back up for my other cords Until i break it out and use it hard for 6 months I have nothing else to say here Hey this worked really good till my grand nephews dog bit it clean in half,positive
I bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo it works good on all of them and is very accurate I also used it to tune my uncles mandolin for him because he couldnt find his tuner Other than that theres not much else to say P I havent used the metronome so I cant comment on that It works well,positive
However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching Usually I do My bad great uke strings but,positive
First off this is a great classic pedal that has shaped the tones of rock and blues artists all over the musical map Its actually a reissue of the pedals Ibanez made in the 1980s though theres some debate over whether or not the modern circuitry retains all of that original tone In my opinion unless youre being purposefully picky or have the most elite of trained ears you would never be able to tell the difference The construction is sturdy metal and actually heavierfeeling than a BOSS pedal The LED light for some reason is difficult to see from an angle but thats largely an irrelevant gripeBut lets be clear what a Tube Overdrive pedal is and isnt This is NOT a distortion petal like the Boss DS1 or Metal Zone MT2 It is also not a fuzz pedal like you would hear on a Jimi Hendrix song It is not meant for heavy rockmetalgrunge type music If you need heavy distortion to mask sloppy playing the TS9 is not for youWhat it DOES do however is to boost the signal at the front end which essentially results in a more dynamic done with additional gain This can result in a very midrangeheavy blues tone Stevie Ray Vaughan used it quite a bit or even a nice crunch overdrive tone ACDC for rhythm work Some guitars use it simply to boost their signal without adding a bunch of additional gain It also works well with other distortion pedals for that purposeLong story short the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer really is one of the more versatile pedals you will use just dont expect it to create every range of sounds you need right out of the box For a cheaper alternative consider Digitechs surprisingly good Bad Monkey overdrive pedal which is half the price and gives you more control over tone Ive also compared this to BOSSs BD2 Blues Driver which is an excellent but very different style of overdrive The BD2 has a much hotter output and is more aggressive the Tubescreamer is more subtle and works in the midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone and responding to picking style If you start with a good amp and guitar setup the Tubescreamer will sound great It wont completely transform your tone but it will give your current tones a boost make those solos really sing and those rhythm chords really crunch A Classic But beware what it is and isnt,positive
These cables are very good quality I like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage They are good quality and very durable Good Quality Cables,positive

I passed on all the Fender GDec units for yearsstill glad I did instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV They are both great amps for sure but for the money Fender has really got this one right The clean tones on this are just great The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy The amp is just about perfect for bedroom studio or practice I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studiosI still love my Line 6 units especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV But if you are in the market for a great practice amp or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo Fender hits the mark on this one Its just ridiculous what is in this for 199I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp not even a contest Against a Spyder IV individual tastes will varyOnly complaint is the stacking of the six effects onto just two knobs But that is a minor complaint Most people dont use chorus and flange at the same time anywayIf you are in the market for a cheap reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal you owe yourself to look at this thing Right now it is the biggest bang for the buck I only wish I had bought the Mustang III but it was not available yet when I purchased Huge improvement over GDec Wished I had bought the Mustang III,positive
I have spent a good month with my new guitar and I am impressed The pickups dont suck the potentiometers are surprisingly good the tuners are not very good but I can live with them The fretwork was second to none absolutely the best fretwork Ive seen in a guitar under 500 The 60s neck profile is very fast and comfortable and its a satin finished neck and body unfinished fretboard Its also not a very heavy guitar considering that its a mahogany body and neck My main issue with this guitar is that the wraparound bridgetailpiece breaks wound strings easily I have gone through 4 6th and 2 5th strings in the single month I have owned this guitar Upgrade it to something better Your strings will thank you Oh and this goes without saying UPGRADE THE STOCK STRINGS 45 stars Upgrade the bridge,positive
Needed a 6ft cable for home recording at my desk all the other long ones would have made a mess under my feet good thing there was this shorty Nice cord sturdy build good sound Electrons go through it and dont leak out so its perfect i guess Again cords are either 1 or 5 this one is a 5,positive
Love the security of having my picks within grasp Great product and great value I would highly recommend this to others Great Product,positive
I bought this stand to mic a kick drum Its too tall for lining the mic up with my port even at its shortest setting Still its wellconstructed and would make a good desktop mic mount I like On Stage stuff Good value and good function Too tall for my application but otherwise solid stand,positive
My wife myself are a Celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed We considered a wireless to use with a battery powered Crate Taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet at these events no power is available When I saw this at the price offered and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered I thought it was worth a try In the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldnt hear the stories in the songs We use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost It kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood The result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show laughing at the comedy crying at the tragedy Our tips cd sales have gone WAY up Is it high fidelity Quite simply no But in our case it works beautifully Recommended just remember the price point and you wont be disappointed depends on what you use it for,positive
I keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall Its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost What more could you want Has replaced my guitar stand,positive
this is as light as you want to go on a LP scale length about the same tension as 9s on a stratso dont want 9s and 10s too tight then 95s it is nice strings perfect gauge for the indecisive,positive
Does exactly what you want it to do It even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand Its easy to set up and easy to take down If youre looking for a mic stand buy this one you really cant go wrong Does the job,positive
A real workhorse for sure Not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars I also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it Use it every week,positive
The Nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but on the negative sideI replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery When picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck I will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings NanoWeb stay clean but,neutral
If you need a tube screamer You cant go wrong with the TS808 The only reason why you shouldnt get it is if it isnt the right tone for you I say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal It sounds amazing It just might not be your sound I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9 People who say this is better than the TS9 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording They prefer it Its not better Both are great Perfectfor me,positive
The sampler pack was a good variety of pick thicknesse and are useful in finding out what type of picks are most useful in playing various guitar styles gUITAR pICKS,neutral
I have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great I have 15 pedals connected to these 2 Visual Sound 1 Spot units on my Pedaltrain Pro and have all the wiring underneath Looks pretty neat along with the George Ls cables that are almost invisible The 1 Spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz Connects and powers great No need for something fancy to effectively power up to 8 of 9V pedals with one combo pack The adaptors work great with other than the regular AC connections like those found on MXR or Boss pedals Highly recommended Very effective and inexpensive product to connect your pedals,positive
This is my second case from them Build good for carry and balance Brass color lock that comes with it Fits my bass,positive
It was cheap to buy but works just fine I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching It is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar In that case I would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier Small convenient and effective,positive
You can use a standard eyeglass cleaning cloth about 2 quid with this instead of buying a microfibre cloth at 5 quid they both do the same imo You could also use eyeglass cleaning solution instead which I have in the past but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars but not on eyeglasses smiles This really does shine up your wood quite well I recommend Does its job well,positive
I still love these things I remember spending over 60 for a guitar tuner in the 80s and having to unplug from the amp to plug into the tuner to tune and then back to the amp with my guitar hanging round my neck Now I just clip it and forget it till I need it and push its little button If I forget to turn it off it has an auto off feature if it detects no vibration for a while A new batterry lasted me almost two years My first tuners battery it came with lasted over a year Expect to pay 5 TO 6 for a replacement battery My more recent Snarks are still running on original batteries I have bought more than one of these,positive
Ive been using Elixir strings since Gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago I use both electric and acoustic The product performs exactly as they guarantee it will Every once in a while Ill get a 34dead34 string Ill just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge Same thing with strings that break while tuning them up Its the only string I use,positive

This is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment with a single modification I was able to fit an array of other condenser microphones in this shockmount I have never owned a samson microphone but judging by the quality of this product I would definately consider buying one attractive,positive
Alright for the past 5 years Ive been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string and let me tell you doing this process on 5 guitars sucks this tool Is AWESOME It takes about 35 minutes to change strings now and its well made and durablethe built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine Its not perfect but neither am I So 5 stars Would recommend to anyone Everyone Needs this,positive
I tend to sweat when I play so coated strings are a necessity for me These are as good as any coated string on the market I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play Oh and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it work well for me,positive
Dr Ducks Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars including my Nitro finished ones Can be hard to remove if you use too much so apply only a few drops at a time Very good cleanerlube that is gentle on delicate finishes,positive
I installed these on my 2000ish Epiphone Les Paul They provide a VERY noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look I can tune with much finer precision and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending The ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better I should note that I had to drill new holes or more precisely enlarge the holes on my guitar I used a 38 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully Im sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary but it was actually quite easy Now they are in there nice and snug since I made the holes a bit tight Excellent quality and precision tuning,positive
It is bright easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so fragile at the base The battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base I like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic Be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own Would I buy it again I dont know Going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way Good tuner but some problems,neutral
I purchased these to replace the springs on my USA Standard Stratocaster These hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs Holds your Trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends Using 10s on my Strat 3 springs was sufficient if you want to hard tail it just drop all 5 in Great product Spring Sprung,positive
Not your average Giant Clumsy Guitar Stand but it works The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support If you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs or even fairly large cats a larger stand might be a better choice If your household is quiet this is very much a good bargain Unobtrusive,positive
These are such comfortable picks I love the texture on them which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks textures This is subtle yet effective My favorite pick now LOVE these picks,positive
I think this is a good deal Its not colorful and flashy but secures theguitar nicely and as a previous reviewer has said it is a little difficult toget on but it shouldnt fall off No flashy but good,positive
I really like Epiphone products They are wellmade easy to play guitars I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back But I received this Uke defective I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldnt here anything at all Totally dead There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down Im disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didnt work in front of him I just requested a returnexchange from Amazon If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me I seem to have bad luck with electricacoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon I had to send back my Dean 12 string elecacoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings fine wood high polished surface high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture If this Uke was working 100 I would have given it a 4 or 5 Nice Ukulele Too bad its defective Gibson quality control shouldnt have missed Otherwise I would give it a 4Star Rating,negative
looks and fits great on my start nothing more I can ask for my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before I replaced it with this one looks great,positive
My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usageOne complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely but works with the others flawlessly I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issuesI also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth its price To me the warranty is worth it because of the price I reead all over the web about the opinions of monsters patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion Great tough cable for bass guitar,positive
I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the packaging along with the cloth This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player Revived dirty bass strings great product,positive
I have been using this little amp very heavily for about a year now and highly recommend it The device is extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next to my mixer it does exactly what I expect the sound is clean Works great great price meets my requirements perfectly Works Great,positive
This is a great pedal for price No its not the most amazing phase pedal but its still quality I know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board If you dont use a lot of phaser but need it for a song or 2 Buy it No reason to bash it,neutral
I use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum These are heavy duty and well made Really reasonably priced I love em Great in the studio,positive
Definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that Ive come across Plus the tweed look really grows on you Ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home Holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on Do it Ordered a bunch use them every day,positive
i got mine yesterday and love it it sounds grate i didnt know what amp to get i looked and looked read a lot of reviews and even got on YouTube to see what people had to say and seems this one had a lot of good reviews i knew fender has a good name for amps and for the money this one was the one i am so glad i got it it gave life to my electric guitar i bought mine somewhere else but still grate amp i didnt want to spend a lot of money for an amp and didnt want to get something small for 20 or 30 dollars less and would out grow with my musicas i get better playing guitar but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will this will save me money in the longrun i am very happy with iti like the five year warranty that came with it you cant go wrong great sound and its not to big nice size ampand easy to pickupnice looking amp grate amp,positive
I chose this rating because I found this product superior to other similar products I have purchased in the past Very cool cloth The material is substantial and it is well constructed much more so than my other polishing cloths,positive
although the quality is obviously not that of a studio this guy serves its purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it i use it when i mess around in garageband and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment its also very easy to use and the USB cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus great buy,positive
Easy and quite simple to use this tuner is accurate and none intrusive so you can leave it on your instrument for a quick retune on the go Excellent tuner,positive
Going to these from what I was using I can fit 2 more pedals on my pedalboard so mission accomplished Great for the task of linking effects pedals,positive
I use mediums but bought these for my nephews Takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar Always love these strings This kid has not changed his strings in years so I thought I would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible Great,positive
This strap button works great works so much better than the string around the neck thingAnd looks better too Nice,positive
I tried these strings on my Zager guitar the are certainly ok and play fine they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru Zager just a little cheaper in cost perhaps maybe they will last longer I had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity I put in there for the guitar wood I live in hot and very dry Arizona these have not rusted so far average to me,positive
A breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with Garageband The bad reviews here are bizarre written by inept people who either cant handle the install or have a buggy PC or OS I was up and running 5 minutes after I tore off the shrink wrap from the packagingTheres plenty of specsdetailsvideos on the interwebs about this software go do some research see if you like it Its way better than the drum kits that come with Garageband and theres plenty of kits to expand with I got the Vintage Rock kit and I love it almost as much as I love pizza which I will marry some day I like a cheese pizza Some call it plain but with the right blend of sauce cheese and crust theres nothing plain about it its somewhat complex much like myself We are a perfect match pizza and me We go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom Im not exclusively a thin crust guy sometimes I dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dishThe only weak point in this pizza I mean software is that you cant do a cymbal swell Apparently its the same with all these virtual kits regardless of brand but it would be nice if someone toontrack would address it by including a side stick attack on the crashes If you try to do a cymbal swell you hear the initial stickoncymbal ting with each attack so its kind of a tingtingtingting sound instead of bwooooosssshhhhh Im sure I can find a bwoosh loop without a tingting Bwoosh loop no tingting Do I get a fortune cookie with thatPizza timeOhhh myyyy loooove my darlin I hunger for your crust Nice shiny drums,positive
I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds After trying for a couple of hours I find that it wont do that I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasnt meant to be used with this pedal The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control he was spot on about that very annoying effect Nothing but praise goes to the supplier KDM Distributors They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country But the pedal itself not for me Joyo JF16 British Sound Effects Pedal,negative
I always LOVE THESEMoreso because I am not getting ripped off by a Brick Mortar shoppe for a tool of the trade I always buy this,positive
I use this at home on my project studio it works great for headphone sessions I use it all the time to run an extra set of headphone in to my vocal boothcloset Its all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn For the money you cant beat it Its not professional quality but Ive done some professional quality work with it with no problem Works great so far,positive
very sturdy high quality with little to no feedback i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it works well great quality,positive
I bought this in lieu of the more expensive Lee Oskar rack Im not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with This rack is constructed better than I had really expected Its easy to adjust However I found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward Getting he harmonica unto te springloaded holder can be a bit tricky Still this is a good deal Good but probably not the best,positive
I use this microphone mainly to record music Occasionally I use it for voice chat where it supposedly excels in quality compared to desktop USB microphones I think the best way to describe this microphone is that it is 34above average34 but does not outperform any higherend nonUSB microphones that I have played with in the past While it is not an 34outstanding34 microphone its still a great entrylevel product for those on a budgetThe microphone is relatively easy to use just plug in the USB cable but it needs some accessories to be efficient For instance the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright It seems like it will tip over if you breathe on it the wrong way Remember to buy a solid desk or floor stand for the microphone as well as a shock mount and a pop filter Good for an entrylevel mic,positive
This is not my only capo but its my cheapest It works as well as other more expensive ones This one was a good deal through Amazoncom Good Product,positive
It isnt top of the line but it gets the job done I wouldnt abuse of the chair too much though the material looks a little floosy Its ok,neutral
I have a small format 10 channel mixer for my acoustic and small gigs and it has no built in effects It also gets a little bit noisy when using the EQ on the two mic pre channelsThe Mic Mechanic allows me to dial in foot switchable effects right on y pedalboard where they should be for a solo act or when your running your own sound I typically leave the 34Tone34 button on at all times as it gives a nice eq curve and mild compression Effects are easy dial up on the selector and can be customized by using the modifiersread the manual The correction works pretty well for me but someone who is a bett vocalist may not need it in which case you can turn it down I typically run mine around 12100E thing I dont like about this pedal is its 12v power consumption It can be phantom powered but if I engage phantom power on my mixer it is on for both mic pres And I use the other often times for a second dynamic mic when playing as a duo It can run off the Sanyo Pedal Power without issue however and I often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delayreverb for my guitar Excellent,positive
Great pedal but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods this thing is absolutley rediculous Its a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder Mod it,positive
Works really well with all of my stringed acoustic instruments It has a good clean sound and I think for the price you can not go wrong AXL Acoustic Guitar Transducer Pickup with 14 Jack and 9 Foot Cable,positive
I say perfection because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do It is also a great value for what it does It offers ample volume for small venues I love having two mic inputs and the CD input The Behringer AT108 along with my Fender amp gives me plenty of performance capability Perfection,positive
This amp cable is perfect It fits my need for practicing Its just the right length for sitting on the couch strumming daily I would like this one for each amp I own so Im not always taking it from amp to amp I will buy some more of theseThe cable also looks nice and completes the Fender look I would highly recommend this and give it a nobrainer 5 star rating I have nothing negative to say about this very nice cable,positive
These are nice easy to use capos and the price was great I got several of them to use during my guitar class when someone doesnt have a capo and needs one good capo,positive
I cant believe these were actually sent to me The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China I am sending them back There is no way I would use these Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost The Slide Continues,negative
Well I didnt expect much due to the price But trust me this thing is really goodIve tried EH nano grail I own the holier grail Ive heard the boss verbs And I really like this one Save your money this pedal is good enoughIll make a video and post it soon Surprisingly good,positive
Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on They work perfect and look good You get 2 in package with screws so I have a spareUpdate I only had one on EB but went ahead and added one for GD Works and look great google stratocaster string tree placement if you are unsure of where and how to install They Look Cool,positive
I picked this simple interface up back in 2007 and I can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years Its been gigged dropped and even rained on however it still sounds great and functions perfectly I was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free ASIO4All driver I was able to get anywhere between 5ms and 10ms latency Under Windows 7 it was plug and play with the default WDM driver however to really take advantage of capabilities youll want to install ASIO4All especially if youre using Ableton FL Studio energyXT etc All and all the UCA202 is pretty limited however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your PC For the functionality alone its definitely worth asking price A Simple Yet Surprisingly Functional Interface,positive
The effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while I just couldnt live with it Good effects,neutral
What can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do I used to put my water on the stage an 12 the time kick it over Now its right where I can find it everytime Got milk or beer or water,positive
I own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them I use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stageThe ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very slinky ie not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to beAnd a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price Great Quality Cable,positive
I have owned other capos but this one is simply the best I doesnt take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time Best capo Ive owned,positive
Keeps gear dryNot for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitarsZipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much Good cheap gig bag,positive
these strings are great with my acousticshowever lately ive been using electric strings instead they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing great strings,positive
This is my new favorite tuner Not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently it works like a champ I dont mean that it works I mean that it works better than any of my other tuners It is SUPER tight It recognizes pitch differences that my ear cant leaving a better tune than my RP255 or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like Ive got laying aroundI plan on buying these for all my guitars I love this thing,positive
This is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich Three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility Runs forever on a ninevolt battery I keep mine next to the couch so I can always plug in and have some fun Its small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to beOverall a great little deal for the price Stop waiting and grab one you cant go wrong Great little mini practice amp,positive
I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my goto brand Ive read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string in over 10 years of playing them Cant even imagine The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tonebut I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed Im not a fan of the Polyweb which has a much more visible thick coating The nanowebs get it rightthey last a long time sound great and as far as I know dont flake polymer dust in your kisser Outstanding sound and quality,positive
Great prce Good value,positive
Made of quality material I do not need anything fancybecause I am a simle person It does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar basic strap,positive
Was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well I still use the Kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup Surprisingly good,positive
I dont travel often with my guitars but needed good protection for those times when I do This product meets all my expectations My Les Paul and Fat Strat both fit well in the case It provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment The corners of the case are well reinforced The hardware is midgrade I believe it will hold up well for my use and for someone playing weekend gigs Overall it is a bargain for the price An Affordable Quality Product,positive
This capo is small looks good and works very well It is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar Great Capo,positive
If youre a musician there are those things that you gotta have on a regular basis and for guitar strings are one of those things I give these 4 stars rather than 5 just because I know there are better strings out there However these ones are great I like the sound they provide and the price is nice My Go To,positive
This is the best guitar cleaner and polish I have ever used It cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxygreasy feeling that cream polishes leave This is a must for black guitars Great product Only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz Its quite expensive for 4oz But 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck Best CleanerPolish EVER,positive
These picks are kind of thin flexible and have a good rubber grip Theyre as good for speedpicking as they are for strumming The only complaint I have is that theyre too thin for me The pack brings 6 picks If youre looking for thin flexible picks with a good grip then these will do Great picks,positive
Sturdy stand Its sturdy,positive
I have tried few picks textured mallow color and this bright green I like it bright color that is very easy to found and 088mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar Like Bright Color,positive
If you have really large or heavy speakers you might want to consider professional grade stands but these will work fine for any speakers under 35 lbs or so maybe more if you keep them lower down They look nice and are easily worth their selling priceThey do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers so youll have to figure out what you need and buy those things separately For the money these are great,positive
I had been using 12s on my S35 Takamine and they were over powering the chassis with vibration The result was poor sound Switching to these 10s made a huge difference in tone It took a bit to get used to the lightness but now I will stick with them on this guitar They are also easy to do bends which I like alot I have never broke a DAddario acoustic string Great for good sound on an inexpensive Acoustic,positive
I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 114mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III And now my personal debate continues I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is I like tortex and this isnt butI really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at timesThey make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tipsThis is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isnt such a bad idea after all 1 of several picks that I use,positive
Just got this today and Im experiencing serious install issues Please note that Im not a newbie to this stuff Im an IT guy I have a new Acer computer thats less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7 The mic is recognized but not as a sound input device just as an Other USB Device I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily so its not that the mic itself doesnt workMy purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you cant just assume that the install is a nobrainr at least not on a PC The Samson tech support was friendly enough but not very helpful They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support The support guy said well thats really all there is to it which I can understandbut I still have a 70 mic that wont work with my computer I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device We tried it a number of ways and nothing workedI ordered this for use with my iPad as well and I ordered the camera kit to do so Despite what Id seen in the reviews and videos online the mic I received would work not with that either The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in indicating its not getting enough power instead of BlueI tried this on my wifes iPad and my daughters too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem though it could be the camera connector I supposeSoI ended up returning the whole shooting match Disappointing tooI really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good Install issues,neutral
best tool ever Five Stars,positive
I bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon I wasnt planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar The way the military palletizes all of its cargo I figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it but I took the chance anyway It arrived intact and ready to play The strings are a bit cheap but the guitar itself is well made and has a really nice rich tone I was planning on giving it away when I left but I am shipping it home instead and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home but it is worth it This one has worked out so well I am taking a chance on a 12 string soon to arrive in Theater Awesome cheap guitar,positive
Have these on my Tele very interesting to play around with I bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so I bought these instead These were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys They still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone When playing these I tend to play more sixties inspired the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool I really like them but they are completely different and I wouldnt recommend them to everyone As far as CQ goes these are great no problems feel great sound great Great,positive
I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ONOFF toggle on the microphone and for us it works great These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day They are still going strong A Great LowCost Mic,positive
Sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss pedal Sounds like it belongs to 80s trash metal didnt really do me to good with modern death or thrash metal Sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss,positive
very quick shipping it works perfectly I was able to screw it in without and predrilling as well works with multiple straps as well perfect projuct,positive
Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturers defects the unit does what it was meant to do I do however question whether the word Pro should apply to this system Although the 14 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about To its defense it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet awayAfter playing with the device for a couple more minutes I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception Even the length of the mic cord whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality YIKES Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above Im afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes Ill probably be returning this unit asap Realistically What Do You Expect,negative
Cut the strings like they was made of paperReally good price Did what it was suppose no need to say anymore Perfect,positive
This original plug fits the purpose perfectly Quality and precision The plugs dont take up space couldnt be smaller and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard Keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with Make sure what you receive is a One Spot product in its original packaging check images Best plugs for One Spot,positive
This thing is TINY and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark This is the only tuner you need 100x better than original Snark,positive
I bought this so I had no mess with cables on the board and Im happy to say it works perfectly It has everything you could ask for on a PedalBoard and not only works with Behringer I have Suhr Boss Fender Marshall Dunlop and TC pedals and they fit very well It comes with cables and configuration diagram ideas not to mention its a great advantage for taking it on the road without having to dissemble everything Now my gear is always ready Everything is in order now,positive
Works great sounds great its a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate Tascam rocks Bit on the plasticy side but is really built quite well,positive
I own a JamHub Greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space This cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the JamHub colour coding systemThe cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed The cable itself is a bit rubbery and not slinky like some of the higher grade microphone cables but so far they have held up fine The cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier Perfect for a JamHub System,positive
I bought two of these one for each of my sons 12 and 14 I wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age So far they seem awesome They adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them Definitely not a flimsy stand Bought two doubly pleased,positive
It works for what it is it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up Not a bad product just dont know how long it will last Kinda flimsy feeling but has worked ok for a couple windings so far,neutral
Love the Snark SN2 Works well on my bass and does a beautiful job on both acoustic and electric guitars Tight tuning and easily used Very good product overall not to mention the reasonable priceBuy it Cant beat itfor under 75,positive
Im frankly sick and tired of showing up for a gig and having my keyboard run through the PA thereby in essence causing me to forfeit all control of the instrument to the bandleader or board op Still Ive had to concede that the amps Ive been usinga Roland KC150 then a KC350had plenty of power and pop but no sonic attributes that would recommend them above the Bose PA setup the band uses Then because I needed a small amp with an XLR connection for use as an emergency PA I picked up this relatively new item from Roland which prominently describes itself as a monitor amp ie meant only for the performers earsWas I surprised when I got this thing home and put it through some rounds with a Kurzweil PC2 and SP2 Its little more than a compact brick but it appears to have the power of my KC150 and more importantly in terms of listenability it sounds like its several heavens apart from the KC 150 or 350 those everpresent Roland KC amps will make any piano including Rolands sound uninspiring if not boring during the course of a fourhour gig This latest contender covers the entire piano range effortlessly smoothly providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed and brilliant but not strident highs Perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle colored If so Ill take the coloration any day to the untempered sounds Ive been getting from electric keyboards The midrange is tight and controlled with the upper register growing out of it gradually but unmistakably By contrast the upper register on the heavyduty KC amps strikes like a serpent leaping out of the mix like homebrewed white lightning hitting the palate after its just gotten accustomed to a vintage BordeauxI even compared this little thing to my previous standardthe Roland Cube 60 that had preceded the KC150 which has been around too long This new one was smoother bending to the bass notes like a gracious willow and springing to the top ones like fresh spring birch In other words even the Roland Cube sounded uneven and rough compared to this latest overachiever which handled the tones of the scale like a single portamento revealing no holes in any of the registersPlaying any instrument or amplifier on the job can lead to a judgment radically different from the one made at home If my instruments Im usually playing 23 have to be mixed through the PA fine I wont have to listen to them Theyll be processed by this monitor which will be facing and playing for me before it kicks out the stuff that the bandleader deems worthy of the publics ears Emancipation Proclamation,positive
This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima not the product These people posted what seemed like a good price not ridiculously low on the Us Dream pedal It was to be shipped from Japan They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazoncom because the item was less than 400 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldnt make a killing on the item I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident Yorozuya Yokoshima,negative
Yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but its an amazing guitar Ill admit I bought it because it was cheap so I could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged but it sounds great and plays really well I like how the wood finish isnt all slick has a nice natural feel to it Feels and plays great,positive
I own three of these units one Red 222 and two Grey 202and use them to output midi sounds from my laptops internal sound moduals to a pro PA system mostly Mackie gear for live performance and occasionally to add sounds to recordings in my 24 track home studio This unit is quiet and very handy The price is dead cheap I have two other similar units a Lexicon Alpha and the smaller Lexicon Omega boxesthat cost much more Yes my Lexicon boxes provide a lot of different inputs and outputs and are very nice but if all you need is a very portable basic inputoutput sound card that is very quiet and easy to install just plug it you should buy this boxSome of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic Yes it is plastic so are many other more expensive units but I have been throwing these boxes in with my other equipment and have yet to break one of them or have any problems I will also admit that while I dont abuse my equipment on purpose I am not that gentle either and have dropped these several times with no damageThe software that comes with the 222 package is good but in my case I really didnt need it I have SonorCakewalk software and Abobe Audition but I would like to take a moment and say something about the included Audacity One reviewer wrote that it is a very lowlowlow quality software That couldnt be further from the truth I have used this software for years in my studio and it is very high quality software It can work in both 16 and 24 bit processing and input and output almost every type of audio format wav MP3 etc It also has a ton of very nice free downloads compressors EQs sonic enhancers etcfrom the Audacity web site Audacity started life as a shareware but was purchased by Sound Forge who was in turn bought by Sony This is high quality studio software that you can still download and use for free and its not a trial software that will expire in 30 days or block out important features I would add that to really make it work well you need to use the preferences section to set it up to the higher quality settings that are available As I remember the defaults are set at mid level quality so the average home user can use it without taxing their computer resourcesThe bottom line is that both Behringer units 202 and 222 both work great and I cant hear or see any difference in them other than the color and the added software included with the 222 package For such a low price you cant go wrong Great unit that just worksHigh quality sound,positive
I bought this on a whim to use as a low cost tuner for my Hola ukeand find myself using it on my six string guitar and four string bass as well It tunes quickly and easily with different colors used for when your too high or too low in pitch and uses green as the color when you nail it very nice and easy to use Its also very compact easily storing in even the tightest of gig bags even your pants pocket will do for travelingI highly recommend this if your on a tight budget and can only get one tuner for multiple instruments its a bargain and it works great You cant honestly ask for more Surprisingly good,positive
This stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands jammers and home studio owners because I run across them everywhere And like everyone else I wound up with a few of my own Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces assuming the areas are not overly cramped They hold up under light gigging and jamming meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week Good stability inside even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 StudioGrade Dynamic Performance Microphone Not so good outside if there is a fair breezeI lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet which immediately broke and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gears As for the binding I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been preventedFor inexpensive stands these are hard to beat However I now use theSeismic Audio Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand PADJBandChurchWedding use which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price Also for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand Blackto be a far better solution Solid for light use,positive
Unless youre going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords these will do for any medium sized venue Great Value,positive
WaWa pedals come and go and get modded and rethunkBut I always wanted an original Cry Baby So this was a birthday gift to myselfNot disappointedDown the road I MAY add some of the gazillions of electronic mods available now to personalize the sound but for the time being Im gonna enjoy this pedal AsShippedVery Good Buy Great packaging earlierthanexpected delivery Thanks Amazon Everything I Ever Expected,positive
I give them an excellent rating They do last a long time and they do not seem to alter in tone and get that muddy sound when theyre aging In fact Id say they actually do manage to approach David Gilmours tone at times I could barely believe that of course but after playing hard for a few hours I actually said to myself the phrase Wow that sounded like David Gilmour somewhat So the fact that that occurred without me actually thinking about Pink Floyd or Gilmour and just being lost in the playing says a lot because I then realized I had strung up the guitar with the strings that day Get them if you like Gilmour Im hard on pricing usually but I say these are priced decently for their effectiveness They actually sound a little like the David Gilmour guitar tone,positive
Seems to work well Like the other reviewers said you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing solid construction getting used to the attachment It will never stand in the position like in the photo Theres no resistance on that joint so it flops down Just place it upside down Record using a headset or youll get too much feedback Just ordered a shorter stand Hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down Good microphone for the price,positive
I like a lot this pedal Its has a deep overdrive Im using 18Vdc to supply power and it deliverys a fat overdrive Im using a TS808 in front of OCD Very deep overdrive,positive
I have a number of guitars and keep them all on stand in my music room This stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well a great guitar stand,positive
I bought this hoping to use as intended angled into guitar straight into mixer wrong have to use it the other way around sad 180 degrees out,negative
So heres the thing that no one else wants to say The thing is built like a piece of s It jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around I used this 3 times and it shorted out The lights started flashing and it got hot I called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a ticket FYI if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6 Not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc I could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on I wish I would have never bought this but hopefully I get a new one soon Well see how helpful they really are Garbage,negative
I have had this pedal for about 15 years just replaced the old one a month ago It distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedalThis does just what it says it does One Volume knob one tone and one distortion knob CRANK IT Distorts sound just like it says,positive
After all the whining I saw about these picks was a little hesitant but bought them anyway It doesnt help that Amazon puts Most popular posters above Most recent so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each So I got my full order In addition I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes These are by far my favorite picks The feedback is good and theyre stiff enough to strike clear tones A winner to me Better than expected,positive
There are some more compact units out there like planet waves and the intellitouch PT10 is a little clearer to read but this baby is great for the price I leave it on my Strat while I play as it can be easily turned onoff as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock The back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner Overall great deal for the price Excellent for the price,positive

I was looking for a thin crash on a budget and I gave this company a try and I couldnt be more happyI had reservations at first but when I installed it on my set and used it today I was very surprised It hasa great hissing crash that lingers a bit as a much more expensive cymbal would have This companyputs out a good cymbal and I have a combination of all of the top line names on my set Great Cymbal for the Money,positive
Itll do for setup work and the price is right I wouldnt recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set I also wouldnt recommend it for anyone just starting out A spring clamp type capo would serve better This one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up Okay I guess,neutral
Works exceedingly well for any use Whether dubbing audio recording instruments or just yelling at the top of your lungs No issues and pretty sure I will never have any Great mic,positive
GOOD POINTS 1 This cable unlike many other coiled cables Ive tried does NOT add noise when its moved I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it and it made no noise at all 2 It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end As a result the cable does not slip out TOO easily the connection between jack and plug is quite secure BAD POINTS 1 The package it comes in says its a 20foot cable Not even close Holding it up by one end with the other end simply dangling ie not plugged into anything I saw that it measures 3 feet again thats when its not stretched when not stretched at all it measures just 3 feet Of course this would not result in 20 feet when its stretched Sure enough when I plugged it into an amp I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 65 feet This might not bother you it doesnt bother me since I didnt want the extra cable length But if you need anything like a 20foot cable youre going to have to get something else 2 Finally a minor point If youre using this on a guitar with a Stratstyle jack this cable will be a bitbut only a bitmore difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar no matter which end you plug into your guitar because theres not much to grip when unplugging Of course if you pull on the cable itself instead of one of the ends youll ruin it in no time Overall I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more since I dont need more than the length it has and since it makes no noise NOT 20 feet about 65 feet instead maybe that matters,positive
Not much to say about a basic bag It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar has good padding and has a large front pouch for music and small fairly flat items like a tuner winder or spare strings Has a carry handlestrap but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have Seems well made Good Gig Bag,positive
This filter arrived very quickly I use it with a Scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should Good purchase Pretty Good Filter for the price,positive
These cables are excellent quality cables however if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup these cables are rather bulky and stiffThe large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as Hosa Rather bulky for close patching,negative
Allows me to keep picks on my mic stand for quick access if I need to grab a new one or drop one Fits nice and snug on the mic stand and the picks are also snug into the holder Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy solution to having picks ready to go Great solution for having picks ready to go,positive
After tons of experimenting I settled on the EXL116 for D standard and E flat standard Ive tried 1052 but the top is a little too floppy for D and that makes notes sound out of tune if you dont press the string just right Also tried 1156 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string That reduces articulation So while you get a fuller sound with the 56 you get more dynamics and attack with the 52 and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier You can EQ fullness into a rhythm track but you cant add in pick attack and greater dynamicsTension wise at D standard 1156 is ideal but 1152 is doable Sound wise 1152 has been best for my metal recordings and thats why Im sticking with the EXL116 set from now on I also replaced the G string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords And compared to Ernie Balls Daddarios start off less bright but maintain their brightness longer thus a more even and predictable response over time Great for D and Eb standard,positive
Compression is possibly one of the most misunderstood pedal or rack effects for guitar players but I can say confidently that the MXR Custom Comp gets it right and makes it easyWHAT IT DOES First a quick word about compression The easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitars pure tone When you play an uncompressed guitar signal you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively On the other side of the problem you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous ringing effect but find that the individual notes die out too soon A quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them It also can sustain the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away depending on the settingsBUILD QUALITY If there are complaints to be had about the MXR Custom Comp they arent related to durability MXR pedals like BOSS pedals are built with heavyduty metal yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed Unlike BOSS pedals the switch is in the form of a metal button that clicks when you press it My understanding from veteran MXR users is that the switch is very reliable and longlasting In my case however I intend on having the thing on all the time so this is not a major concern anywayOne gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal Attack control The pedal has knobs for Output volume and Sensitivity basically amount of compression The Attack knob which is found on some rival compressors has to do with the degree of pick attack sound you want when you first hit the note and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly But on the MXR Custom Comp you need to remove the back plate 4 Phillips screws and adjust the Attack know with a screwdriver You also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery though Ive switched to a power adapterdaisy chain OneSpot for my pedals anyway So yes its an inconvenience but with this type of effect its not like you would want to adjust the Attack the way you would mess with Tone or Gain on a distortion pedal I consider this also to be a nonissueTONESOUND QUALITY The sound quality of this effect is outstanding It is far more transparent than other pedals Ive tried in terms of retaining the tonal characteristics of my guitar but leveling everything out for a great finishing touch Whereas I used to think of compression as an effect I would turn on for a specific type of tone I could envision always leaving this effect on with the MXR Custom Comp It simply makes my underlying clean tone and other effects more manageable and better soundingCOMPARISON TO OTHER PEDALS The toughest question to ask about the MXR Custom Comp is whether it is worth the extra money The topend professional compressors Keeley pedals rack units etc are usually north of 200 which isnt practical for a casual player Boss makes the CS3 Compression Sustainer which is the pedal I traded in for the Custom Comp The CS3 is more affordable about 50 to 75 new and more customizable with 4 knobs on the exterior of the pedal adding Attack and Sustain It definitely does the job in terms of adding sustain and might make sense if you only want to play around with compression from time to time But much like with MXRs entry level compressor The Dyna Comp in the red casing it simply isnt up to the quality of this pedalADVICE While compression doesnt color your guitar tone the way a distortion pedal does its arguably as important to your overall tone quality as any other pedal If youre interested in compression and want the best option at an affordable price I recommend the Custom Comp at 100 or less on Amazon or used on eBay where Ive seen it go for about 70 to 85 It may not be necessary for everyone but very few people who try it will come away disappointed Turn it on play with the settings for a minute or two and then leave it on and strum away Finishing touch to a professional sound at a lessthanprofessional price,positive
Its a decent unit but stopped working completely after about 6 months Tried everything I could but its gone I would not recommend this pedal Stopped working after about 6 months,negative

These replaced the stock tuners on my Squier Deluxe Stratocaster and were NOT a drop in fit There are two pegs on the tuners that didnt line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes I was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken awayThese make string changes so easy and I love the ratio of these tuners Because they are staggered I was able to ditch the string trees as well Love these,positive
After lots of researching I finally decided to buy this Zoom pedal so far it has worked great has all the features mentioned lots of great options also a great guitar tuner For those doubting you actually can just plug your headphones in the output jack and practice without an amp which was an amazing bonus for me since Ive yet to buy my amp 5 starts totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal Great effects pedal,positive
I like Elixir I had to try this one because of another friend said its ok and cheaperI tried it and the quality is low endThe sound is not as crispThe gauge is too heavy for my fingers not their problemAll 6 strings are wrapped inside one single bagId go back to Elixir next time tonal quality is flat,neutral
Ive had this thing for several weeks and just now when it fell off the table for the 100th time I tossed it in the trash The whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber its not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck and its not heavy enough to stay put Even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over Unless you glue this thing to the table or something like that its useless even worse than useless its in the wayAddendum I raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributormanufacturer at least these guys listen Not useful at all,neutral

Id first like to say that I bought this guitar on Amazon for about 65 a lot cheaper than its being sold now currently 111 Its a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solidbody but it looks a little different than the picture would lead you to believe For one the guitar doesnt have a finish not even a glossy clearcoat its solidbody wood sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain Secondly the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is The photo shows it looking almost like a red colored wood in reality its a much darker deep brown akin to coffeeThis does not however affect its playability which is wonderful I have a bit of buzzing on one fret but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish The guitar can also be strung and tuned easily though with any guitar of this body style youll have to continually tuneandretune until the strings will keep a tuning Its a very heavy sturdy guitar and for a solidbody with two humbuckers youll likely not find one that sounds as meaty and smooth Awesome inexpensive guitar,positive
I do like this pick as well Its the third color of the same pick I purchased I will probably always use these Like it,positive

Unhappy with it actually I already replaced them The method of attachment is poorly designed it doesnt matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions Expensive locks too Method of attachment is poorly designed,negative
Its easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly A must have for a new Uku player,positive
Unfortunately I wasnt aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when I need the large The medium fits over my pinky finger and while thats okay I prefered it fit over my index finger where Id have more controlI cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so Ill pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger Dunlop 212 Slide I bought the wrong size,positive

Being from Tampa I wanted my first guitar to be a Dean Sure there are plenty of other options out there but I just had it in my head thats what I wanted Well I must say I am very happy with the purchase Guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box inside another Dean shipping box which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another larger Amazon box Was essentially ready to play right out of the box with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs One knock on it I have seen online before buying was that the tuners dont hold tight I have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it including some drastic bends Checked with a steel straightedge and a light the neck was dead flat and straight The edges of the frets could use some more finishing they are still a bit edgy I have seen others mention filing them down a bit same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory I will probably get some diamond files and do this as well I keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck Im no expert on tone but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects Ive thrown at it I did restring mine with the DR Neon MultiColor strings for using with Rocksmith which required adjusting the intonation The low E and A strings ended up at the very end of their range and the A is actually still a tiny bit flat This could well be a factor of those particular strings though so I wont knock the guitar for it As others have noted the finish can vary drastically Mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable Overall looks a nice piece especially for the cost I could not ask for better for this price From what I hear from more experienced players as I progress I could easily upgrade the tuners and pickups though I think I will leave this one alone and just get a higher end guitar when its timeOVERALLNice looking feeling guitar for a beginnerPROSExcellent valueGood quality constructionFeels and looks good right out of the boxCan be upgraded in time if you chooseCONSTuners may or may not slip when playing hardFinish is variable be willing to accept whatever shade you get Only my first guitar but I absolutely love it,positive
Well i have another Strap that looks like this one but i can tell you that this is cheaper on the materials Anyway it does what is supposed to do and im happy with it i wasnt looking for anything expensive but this works really good If you want something to just practice with this is what you should get I recommend it Its ok,neutral

To be clear I am quite the newbie guitar playerAfter i managed to break a string on my electric guitar i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself as most guitarists do Things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke I just figured it was something I did and wasnt the products fault so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine Overall ive played quite abit with these strings and have yet to break another one Pretty good sound quality and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moistureresistant package to prevent corrosion Pretty good strings,positive

These cables have been solid we use them in the studio every single day and have held up so well compared to many others Ive ordered for lessYes 70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money but dont be fooled nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable Not only do these hold up and sound great Ive found that when working with a complicated studio setup Im always surprised how helpful the colorcoding actually ends up being For the price this is totally worth itI use these with the following to really color code my studio setupColor windscreensGLS Audio Mic Windscreens MicrophoneColor electrical tapeB004ZZVHGWColor patch cablesB003VYBNHGDefinitely worth it Makes a huge difference Definitely worth the price helpful for complex recording setups,positive
I got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp Like the other reviewers on here Im sad to report that its quite hissy I had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is Im using a Line 6 Uber Metal Boss Metal Zone Ibanez LA Metal Boss CompressorSustainer with my SKB pedal board The board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up BUT when I put the EQ700 in with the others theres a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp Im using a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo above 4 you can definitely hear the hiss Not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but Im going to give the Danaelectro Fish Chips as recommended by another reviewer a tryIm waiting on the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and HOPING it isnt hissy like the EQ700 isI will say though I do like the tone influence this pedal has It does a nice job of altering the tone gives my rig a greater flexibility for soundsOverall I give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars ItsOkay,neutral
Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar It seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks Cable works as described,positive

I recently ordered this ukulele and 4 others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few optionsOkina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard NaturalDiamond Head DU150 Ukulele NaturalMahalo U30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele OrangeLanikai LU11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under 30 at the time and within 2 price of each other Of the three I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20 and 40yearold ukuleles which had the original strings A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly but even then the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price levelThe Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice for this price little gig bag Incidentally what the Mahalo product description says is a colormatching brown gigbag ended up being black but black is pretty standard gig bag color The Mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Heads That being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since its so near the same price compared to the Diamond Head and has better strings already installed Ive also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages The best uke at this price,positive

DAddario Strings Are Simply The BestThe brightest tone normal lifespan fair prices and louder than the restI have played guitar professionally for over 27 yearsThese strings are the best all around for tone clarity punch and volumeDont be fooled by strings that may last longer or have coating on them just to sacrifice clear toneOne a side note I hate their new packagingThey used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves Then about a decade ago they started winding them individually but placed them loosely inside a plastic sealed pouch NOW they wind up two at a time and place them inside a plastic pouch ArrghSame great strings and tone but now you have to unwind them from their 34pairs34 and lay them out twoatatimekind of aggravating but NO FRIGGIN WAY WOULD I EVER USE ANOTHER STRING lolI compared these and other DAddarios to other manufacturersthey were much louder and cleanerDont be an idiot Buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately DAddario Strings Are Simply The Best,positive

Ive been using aKorg TM40 Large Display Digital Tuner and Metronomefor a long time with my guitar While adequate I wanted the Snark because it was made specifically for guitar and the clipon feature would counter my laziness in finding the tunerThe snark is great and the price is amazing The Snark unlike the Korg tunes by vibration so if it isnt attached the the guitar it wont work I feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient With the Korg the dial would spin all over the place and I would just mentally estimate where the right tone would be The Snark is much more decisive and faster so it eliminates all the guesswork out of tuning You will know exactly how sharp or flat the guitar is or if you want to try alternative tunings like dropD it is so much simpler than with the KorgNo metronome but thats what Im keeping the Korg for I also wish that this specific came in another color other than black There are Snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitarsOverall extremely happy with this purchase Simply excellent,positive

really you hate warm sustaining naturaltube overdrive you wont like it at all This is my favorite OD pedal that I have I have compared it to the Vox ValveTone OD the OD side of a EHX Germanium4 BMP a EHX Linear Power Boostmy second favorite an Ibanez TS590s model and a Boss Fender Bassman FBM1 They all have their uses but I find the MojoMojo to be the most versatile warm and punchy OD I have I pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive This thing really wants to sing to you There are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers Thats not to say it doesnt have some serious punchiness on the low end which it does so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups I pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers Single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and I am guessing thats why there is the voice switchThe knobspots are nice and the basstreble pots are notched at 12 Turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts The drive goes from really clean and subtle like a mild boost up to super drive territory I actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a Fulltone OCD it just sounds a little more livelier to me I really like to push this pedal into the Fender Bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey belllike highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the FBM1 as a third channel of sorts and it sounds like a totally different amp stackLike I said this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time I have had it I was using the EHX Linear Boost to perform these duties before and it performs well but the soulful tone I get from the MojoMojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesnt I play mostly original compositions but I am going for the Jeff Beck tone and this helps me get where I want to goOf course none of this means I will stop buying OD pedals o Dont buy this pedal if,positive
I much prefer curly cable as they keep the slack up off the floor and help prevent nasty little tumbles and equipment spills due to general clumsiness These cables are no different They may not be the nicest looking cables ever but for this price you cant shake a stick at itThe connectors are injection molded so theres no easy unscrew and resolder when the time comes but hey for a budget curly cable I am not complaining Ill just nip the ends off if I need to replace them later The cable seems to be of good quality Im guessing its about 24 gauge wire and has a nice bounciness to it I have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so its probably fairly wellshielded With the rightangled jack on one end it ensures a low profile so I dont easily kick the cable out of the pedal and will probably help it last longer with the reduced cable strain on that end Thats more than I thought I had to say about a cheap but good cable Curly cables rock,positive

Ill be upfront and honest right away and say that Im not the biggest fan of headstock tuners I love the idea but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought Id give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I dont like about the other ones COUGHsnarkCOUGHA little background first I guess Ive been playing guitar for the last 9 years and I currently have two other tuners I have a little Korg plug in type where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up I also have a Boss TU3 pedal tuner If Im jamming with friends or playing a show the TU3 is what Ill use to stay in tune Its very durable and accurate and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends andor the audience For home practice I use the Korg as I usually tune up before I start playing then just plug into my practice amp and blast away The Korg is nice and accurate easy enough to use for alternate tunings and in 9 years of having it around including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU3 Ive only had to buy one replacementI first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days He was not incredibly pleased with it Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasnt exatly easy to tune up with it While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something Id want on my headstockEnter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me1 Accuracy It does seem to tune accurately thats a good thing and it already puts this ahead of the Snark Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however so do keep that in mind Also the letters take some getting used to as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players Not a huge complaint but it isnt as idiot proof as my Korg or TU32 LooksEase Of Use Its quite a bit more subtle than the Snark able to hide behind your headstock which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock I wear my guitar fairly low so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem though itll work great for them Also it is plenty bright so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue3 Durability This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are The Snark is very easy to break as it rests on a small ball joint This Planet Waves mini isnt going to lose its head too easy but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I dont expect it to hold up under too much use The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session I still think it would be easy enough to break I havent had it long enough for this to happen yet so I can only give you my initial impressions Lets just say this Id never gig with this guy as my only tuner Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of useAll in all it is a better headstock choice than the Snark However headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before theyre gonna work for everyone Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner I personally suggest a Boss TU2 or TU3 or a Korg Pitchblack I know theyre more expensive but youll be happier off in the long run Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session this is a nice option But it may not hold up foreverIll probably stick to my TU3 and my Korg plug in but as headstock tuners go this is nicer than most Its good for what it is but theyre not great yet,neutral
My main headphones before were HD280s which I thought were pretty good until I got these I have several pair of HD280s one for mixing audio one for practicing with drums since they have decent isolation and one for her to useI have one of these and the amount of detail is great I have a set of MAudio BX8as and these have a touch more clarity which considering the price differencewow For mixing audio though cant use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right but I think these will get used for mixing more and more with the finalizing on the BX8asI didnt know headphones could sound this good Flat out great headphones,positive

I completely agree with 34JPfromOH34This Planet Waves DAddario Artist Capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectlyThe microadjusting knob for tweaking tensionpressure is nice but Ive wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitarukulele that I have A standard tension spring might be a bit too firm but at least its consistentI also thought Id like the curved cradle for the neck but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele I know I know this isnt designed for ukuleles but I have no such troubles with my Kyser caposI dont understand the clip for a tuner on this thing I have several clipon tuners that clip directly to the headstock And most are Planet Waves already Why would I want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when Im using the capo I suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful additionAnd the pick holder is a nice touch but I use my fingernails so that feature is needless for meAs others have noted there are other better capos out there Its ok but there are better,neutral
Promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it Little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up but overall a very nice part Compliments my BWB pickgaurd nicely Open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes normally found Nice addition to my strat,positive
This liitle box works great for my needs I am using three guitars on stage When possibleroom permittingand use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp This way I can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such It also solves a second problem since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs Fender single coils Ibanez acoustic with Fishman piezo and Les Paul Gibson Humbuckers I now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match This is perfect for that Inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that I velcro to my small pedal boardIm glad someone else mentioned the AC plug on theirs being European standard and not 110 volt US standard Dont be surprised if it happens to you I bought one and had the same experience I got mine from Musicians Friend They offered to have me return it but I chose to keep it since I had a 12 volt power supply available from an older unit I long since stopped using No stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didnt check their inventory to make sure it was US standard Does ecxactly what it saysQuiet reliable and well made,positive
There isnt much to say other than if you are a keyboardist and are in need of a durable high quality sustain pedal BUY THIS PEDAL Absoulutely love it,positive
As far as banjo strings go these are a good bang for the buck or were when I got them DAddario makes a pretty consistant product Ive used them on everything over the years although I prefer certain brands for other things Strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with These are also amazingly enough still made in the USA as wellIf you buy a cheap instrument here do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are theyll be strung with trash if its a lower end instrument from China Even if youre starting out you should tell the difference right away Are these the best strings No Are they good for the money Yes,neutral
These cables work very well at transmitting sound So why only three stars Well these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find These are stiff thick and heavy While thats good for most analog cables these cables are so stiff and heavy that for instance a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in thereWith so many amps having plastic jacks these days you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguardmounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one I mean lets face it You never know what will happen at a gig Sometimes youre playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable A cable shouldnt come out because of a gentle pull but if its between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it you want the cable to fall out If everything you have is heavy or Velcrod to the ground this isnt a problem but it is for me I feel like when youre playing with these cables youre worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out but because its seriously like a trip wire out thereLastly these plugs are huge Thats not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele but what about a PBass or a JBass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body This is going to stick out a lot and to loop it around your strap its going to be a huge stiff cumbersome loop I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments but most normal straight plugs do just fine So yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables Youll thank meThese cables are just poorly thought out Theyd work great as patch cords or keyboards drum machines from pedal board to amp as long as you have a metal jack Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use and at that price Pro Co cables are also excellent and they have brand name plugs as well Poor cables for active guitar players,neutral

I like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe I bought 2 of these and have had them for a year now and they have yet to let me down My daughter still gets to them and tries to pull them off but she has yet to succeed Very solid constriction I like that they pivot so if my daughter pulls them to the left or the right the piece moves with it and returns it back to balance once she is finished Excellent design Childresistant,positive

I bought one of these a couple of years ago I used it to connect my Behringer BCR2000 in MIDI mode naturally to my computer for mixing duties in REAPER It worked with no issues and I had zero complaintsA few weeks ago it stopped working I had bent the USB connector and so I thought that was the culprit so I bought anotherThe replacement arrived and installed with no issues but Im still having trouble getting it to send MIDI data into the computer MIDI out of the computer to the Behringer is fine Im not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky Windows update thats happened lately but its certainly not ideal In my haste having seen it install OK but without trying to actually use it I discarded the packaging Unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit so now it looks like Im stuck with two possiblybroken USB MIDI interfaces I have reinstalled Windows tried both with another computer uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers all kinds of good stuff and I still cant get either of them to send MIDI data into the computer I was very close to throwing my Behringer unit away as I thought it was broken tooThankfully I tried an old Yamaha interface and it is OK This means I just need to get and buy some MIDI cables and Ill be back in businessSo Id say buy one of these and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away When they work theyre absolutely great and theyre SO cheap If you receive a lemon return it and order another Its worth it if youre not in a hurry If you are in a hurry then order a few of them or just get something elseId also like to advise people that reports of MIDI latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer I strongly suspect that the speed of transferring MIDI data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think and the actual latency youre experiencing is that of converting your MIDI data into audio This happens inside your computer and has nothing to do with this devices performance its purely down to your hardware and software configurations All this talk of ASIO is only really going to help you on the audio side of things If youre using this device to record MIDI data then you should have no issues at all as long as you get one that works Cheers cheap n cheerful ish and watch your latency,neutral
I had some band mates that did not seem to respect my Shure SM58 mics very well so I bought some of these cheap mics to use on them I was very surprised to find that I like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable SM58 and these Behringer mics are about 110 the price eachNo problem with feedback or handling noiseNo problem with electronic induced noiseSounds goodDirt cheapHandy carrying caseWhats not to like Replaced My SM58,positive
I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on neat little item,positive
I have a crowded rig already and the las thing I wanted was another mic stand I already have a straight stand with a Shure SH55 mounted on it as a talkback to call tunes to my band members I wanted to eliminate my wireless sax mic as I was using it infrequently and decided to mount a Heil Fin on this extension arm on the same stand as the talkback Nice and stable no issues works perfectly Great for adding another mic to a stand without hassle,positive
This is a solid product I ended up not needing it so I returned it However it worked fine and gets the job done Nice,positive
I had never considered using an EQ pedal before seeing and buying this but manI was missing out The ten bands are truly incredible in shaping a precise sound and is especially impressive when using distortion Each band is hyper sensitivefive for tone highmidlow and five for gain Aside from providing exact sound control it also boosts your volume a little and functions as an overdrive as well If you dont use distortion though you can still benefit highly from this pedal as even the clean channels become more crisp and effects more pronounced This is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus but distinctly noticeable regardless By far the most versatile pedal I have ever used I cant imagine not using it now that I have it One further noteyou can run this through an adapter chain if you dont want to dedicate an outlet to this one pedalbut it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase Just ups the value even further I really cant recommend this highly enough I think every guitarist and bass player should own oneEnjoy Incredible,positive
Makes changing strings a whole lot easier If you are a guitar player and are changing strings like I was without one of these stop and get one trust me Well Worth It,positive
Ive had Behringer mikes before and currently have a couple of XM2000s which are very reliable and comparable to Shure SM 58s I saw this three pack of 1800s for 40 in a hard case and couldnt believe it I hooked them up right beside the 2000s and while there is a little difference its not much The 1800 has a little more high end but its easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass The presence is also boosted a little on the 1800 meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedbackFor now Im using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists and keeping the older 2000s as backupsI bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one SM 58 Although the Shure and the B 2000 is better the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for I can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backupA wise choice for the budget conscious Good quality for a low price,positive
Unfortunately the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place Take two The second set I received was in great condition and Im really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost This kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course to keep your guitar looking and sounding great The Perfect AllInOne Kit For Your Guitar,positive
This is such a lifesaver or an effort saver Every guitarist should have this In my opinion there is nothing more annoying in the world than changing guitar strings This makes the process so much easier Its a 3in1 product that clips the old string pulls the pins out and winds the new strings in On top of it all its pretty affordable New and improved version,positive
Terrific AllinOne MustHave Tool for GuitaristsI have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this windercutterbridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new modelI am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junkI have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable They keep on keeping on and I have one in every caseBuy youll love it and if not you can always return itHope this helps Terrific AllinOne MustHave Tool for Guitarists,positive
Awesome strings did what I needed them to do Drop AB Good tensionOnly con is that Ernie Ball strings seem to wear out fast and lose tone So for now Im good but in a few weeks Ill need new strings In which case Ill probably go Daddario or CobaltsStill decent strings if you need cheap strings fast Ernie Ball strings are great For the price,positive
This is an iconic fuzz pedal Yes Smashing Pumpkins used this pedal but Corgan also used a Fender Blender which is similar to the Big Muff but has an octive thing going on too This is not a subtle pedal Its cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp I find that it gets a little muddy if I run it into an amp thats already breaking up I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though This is not a wooly splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face It really has its own thing going on Its not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time but its a cool tool for the sonic toolbox If I had it to do all over again I would likely buy the Big Muff with the tone wicker switch Its about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability Face Melting Fuzz,positive
For me being a solo 12 string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me And you get the extra plugs ins supplied by Focusrite too with this interface I cannot say I am wild about the included software which is Ableton Live Lite 8 I really disliked the screen views of Ableton and thought they were hard to view So I did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested Mixcraft 6 WOW I like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork Mixcraft 6 is so user friendly and you dont have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it You can be laying down and recording tracks in no time And shouldnt recording be fun and not frustrating besides The Focusrite Interface recognized Mixcraft 6 as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins So all and all it turned out great and I am a happy camper This in my opinion is one of the best entry level Recording Audio Interface units around It also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power Dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface Engineered in England And on the downside made in China Isnt everything these days Great Audio InterfaceNot so good recording software,positive
I have purchased several amps over the last 7 months see the reviews I attempted to move to tube amps becuase I wanted to set up a pedal board and dial in my own effects And really any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes I went Vox AC4 and realized I didnt want a tube that already has a defined and limited sound no fault of the amp I just had to experience it myself I also didnt want a modeler impersonating a tube I loved the Orange Crush but it was totally unreliableEnter the ZT Holymoley The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior Nice break up very reactive to your playing and literally miles of clean head room But unlike those tube amps my pedals can come into play and I can manipulate that clean sound at any level without losing a bit of clarity or depth It also has an iPod jack headphone jack and ambiance ie make it sound kind of boxy It does not model Like the Crush or Roland Cube it has its own voice Ive heard it compars to a Fender Tweed in tone I guess I can see that but it still has its own voice which is important to me in any amp I should note an AC30 or Fender Twin or high end 1x12 Tube still are louder and much fuller But were talking 1000 tube ampsI dont have the matching extension cabinet because I just dont need it It is REALLY loud I have a Mustang III and it gets destroyed by the ZT At 75 volume on the dial I can hit my DS1 and actually make out the notes That is something the Vox AC4 or Fender Blues Junior cannot do without getting muddy It is fully giggable I havent played live with it yet but in a rehearsel environment keeping with a loud drummer is no issue A friend plugged it into his Marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous Really just stupid powerful for 300For blues jazz or light rock its brilliant right out of the box It not only can do medal with a pedal board but check youtube for videos of the Lunchbox being played in a live setting by a metal band It has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility I would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video You simply will not find a negative thing about the ZT Lunchbox anywhere It really is a solid state aimed to take prefessionals away from their bigger heavier more expensive tubes If you play effect laden music boy are you going to have a hard time walking away from the ZTIf there is a drawback 300 for a solid state amp that really needs external pedals to shine could be a turn off for some especially for players looking for a swiss army knife for an amp Roland Fender Line6 and others still have that niche dialed in If I could do 10 stars I would,positive
This is my fifth time buying this stuff I really like the new container The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one This stuff works great and lasts forever I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirtydry to use One swipe is plenty 2 strings at a time from nut to bridge then just fold the cloth and wipe clean Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier Essential for any guitar player,positive

Ive been playing for more than 30 years There are a lot of great products out there and Ive tried a lot of them I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels Fender 351 Xheavies and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks This is just my opinion but I hope youll check them out because Im sure you wont be disappointed The best thing Ive tried so far,positive

This converts an xlr signal for me a Shure SM57 mic into a 14 male I run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp Have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that Could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall Gets the job done,positive
I like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole or for that matter to the headstock where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole It works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound not quite true to your guitar you will note this in particular with a classical guitar This can be balanced to some degree with your amps equalizer andor the treble and bass settings However compared to the AXL Pickup which I bought for comparison the Cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces It is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the AXL Both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best The Cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar not bad but,positive
This stuff will lube up your strings pretty well The only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use but it comes with a little cloth that I assume is meant for this little inconvenience I love this stuff,positive
Love these thingsI feel a little guilty because I put a pair on my Epiphone Les Paul plus top I also have them on my Fender Marauder and now I can easily swap straps between guitars and Im secure in the knowledge its not going to land on my footYeah you could put one of those plastic Dunlop pick looking things on a regular strap to keep it in place but these look and feel so much cooler They use a quick connect of the kind found in natural gas and compressed air connectors Pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release How did I ever play a guitar without these,positive
This thing does just what it was supposed to i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that and it does just what it is supposed to Good Product,positive
I prefer Shars Overture premieres which are the same price These ones are a little too 34bright34 in sound and not deep or resonant enough Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying 50 a set Acceptable,neutral
I used to think a pick was a pick with the only difference being stiffness I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness The only problems I had with regular picks was 1 them slipping in my hand turning around 2 out of my hand on the floor and of course 3 breaking I decided to give the Dava picks a try I bought a pack of the jazz picks and a pack of these grip tips I really thought Id like the jazz picks better that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick But after trying them both I find these the grip trips are now my pick of choice They fit my grip perfectly stay put in my hand and give me maximum control when I play whether its lead or rhythm I have yet to break one Im mainly buying another set because Ive given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations so whenever I pick up a guitar to play Ive got one close by also always keep a spare in my wallet Bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops Sure I can still use a regular pick when thats all thats available But why not use the best when I canUpdate Been using these picks for a year since my first review Still love them Still have yet to break one and I can be an aggressive strummer The only reason I need to buy more I lose them I have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks But for me they are still tops Which is why Im buying another half dozen best pick,positive
I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch Im glad I tried out these DAddario strings These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn which has mellowed out over the years They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings I cant speak to the manufacturers claim of 4 times more life but as of now Id have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money Highly recommended Superior Strings For A Very Reasonable Price,positive
I would give these picks five stars but I do have a couple of other types I prefer more Still these are nice picks So far Ive only used them on 12string guitar but Ill soon be trying them out on 6string guitars Nice Picks,positive
Grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year I got three single channels and two dual channel unitsSet them up for the keyboard player Dual Channel bass and guitar player DIs plus one from a DI output on a effects module that were all on stage and connected them into my snake running to the back of the venueCrystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console I was impressedNot one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night Even was able to adjust the pad setting on the guitar and bass to cut the signal a bit so I didnt have to use so much compression to keep the signal from clipping going to the recordingNo telling how long these units will last but for the price who cares just buy another one and move onCheck out how these boxes sound on the Bands YouTube page GerrellTheBand to hear the sound coming from these units Near studio quality Solid Construction Solid Sound,positive
I purchased a couple sets of these to try them out They are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune They seem slower to lock then my Snark tuners and the visual scale is not as precise but they do seem to work fairly well The ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars and they can be stored in the case attached Its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need itUPDATE Downgrading my rating by 1 star Having used four NS MicroTuners for a couple of weeks on four different instruments I have to say that in comparison to my Snark tuners the NS Micro Tuner is slow to lock and difficult to tune precisely With the Snark any of themI have several models I can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds With the NS Microtuners I have to repeatedly pluck a string and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment Sometimes I have to pluck a string several times before the NS Microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all It is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target E would be a perfectly tuned E but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort I still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check but when I want to be precise and fast I always reach for the Snark DAddario NS Micro ClipOn Tuner 2 pack,positive
Ive had this amp about a week now and Im still finding cool things about it The first thing I did was went through all the presets I didnt like the clean channel it wasnt really clean but I quickly found out how to set it like i wanted it press the clean button then turn all the preset effects to 0 and then hold down on the clean button about three seconds until the lights blink and now its really clean You can also do this with all the other channels too just set every thing like you want it and hold down the button on the channel you want and there it is and dont worry you can always reset it back to factory settings and start over Its a small amp but its bigger than I thought it would be But the sound that comes out of that 834 speaker is BIG I have been playing for about 30 years and I know I could use this amp in a small club without running it into the PA If you do need a little more volume it has a line out so you can run it to the PA and have all the volume you want I would buy this amp again if mine was stolen Makes a great practice room amp You can take it without all your pedals and still have all the effects you would need For the price its a bargain Big sound in a small package,positive

These strings arent for everyone and probably not what you want for everyday normal playing But if youre looking for a fastplaying string with a bright sound this is the string In addition to putting them on my guitar I also have a sixstring banjo guitar tuning and just couldnt get the sound I wanted from regular guitar strings Light guage nickel strings were recommended to me and they were exactly what I was looking for They have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming I play a lot of bluegrass and Irish music and I feel these strings are ideal for that purpose I use a lot of DAddario strings on my various instruments and I think they offer the most bangforthebuck in terms of quality and tone You can pay more but I dont think you get that much more Although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars Great specialpurpose string set,positive
These headphones really seem to be built pretty well so it is with some regret that I have to report that I dont like themThe sound reproduction is not flat and it has a distinct bass heaviness that I cant use when recording or mixing In addition to the bassheavy delivery there seems to be a dip in the upper mids a boost in the low mids and a rolling off of the high end This just doesnt work for me in the studio The overall size of the headphones is large and they wont fit well for people with smaller heads I had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and didnt fit on their ears properly I checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they wereThis is a shame as TASCAM make some fine products and are a good name I have owned four DA88 recorders many field recorders and three different portable recorders from them all of which have been great I am certainly not saying anything bad about the company but their headphones are just put out there to be lowpriced headphones that are not suited to a professional studioI have used theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone Electronics for decades now and I still recommend them I have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong barring replacing the ear padding The Sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio workI would also recommend theAKG K 240 MK II Stereo Studio HeadphonesorAKG K 240 SemiOpen Studio Headphonesover the TASCAM reviewed here The AKG perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though so that would need to be taken into account Bassheavy with dull highs,neutral
Its definitely hightech but since I dont own a classiclooking or vintage mandolin I dont really care about looks My primary concerns are comfort and function and this product gets five stars on both counts I really like the fact that you can attach the contact points and using the clicklocks remove the strap from the instrument while leaving the contact points in place Also if you get the strap twisted up while installing it just undo the clicklocks take out the twist and reattach it Pure function This strap was very well designed and thoughtout before going to manufacture Five stars Awesome mandolin strap,positive
This mic is good considering the price Does it sound exactly like a 57 No Do it have a decent quality sound Absolutely If youre expecting an SM57 then buy an SM57 If you want something close on A budget this is your mic Great value and good sound Pretty good for the money,positive
The odor of adhesive lingered for some time but thats not really a problemSize and fit were good The storage compartment is nice and largeOne hinge broke after about a year of normal use It was in the house almost the whole time I just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done I noticed if you look carefully one of the hinges is cracked on both sides so it is not holding anything anymore but it is one of three so the other two still do the job just fine It is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fracturedThis was not an expensive guitar and I had a better case so I switched to the better guitar case and used this one for another guitar that I really dont play at all and it just stays in storage Works well for what it is,neutral
I like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing Good,positive
Capos are not something that I shop for I have had two for years One is a strap type and the other is an expensive K type It is similar to this one Yeahin looks only This one blows that one away It has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner It is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways This is great I play a Tele and an acoustic Martin It works great on both I play professionaly and this is the best thing Ive gotten in two years Where has this been,positive
its kinda small for my hand but it works great its more easier to pick the string This pack comes with 6 picks works great,positive
Not much to say here I have a bad habit of putting picks in my mouth and chewing on them effectively destroying them but with these I dont know what theyve done and put on the surface of these things but it is gross Haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks Picks,positive
ive used daddario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic even though this string was my first time use and it havent failed me yet its very stable and in tune all time while playing highly recommand to other ppl good quality strings,positive
I love this guitar string winder The cutter was a real plus so I didnt have to track down my diagonal cutters Great Tool,positive
its really good i like the idea of covering all the strings width and easily applying but the point its dried fast good but not lasting,positive
I LOVE this mic as an indoor studio mic I would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omnidirectional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise But when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic ROCKS Clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well Good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano Also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that tooComes with a dB limiter 16dBswitch right on the mic Works really nicely at limiting background noiseI would highly recommend this especially at the price Comes with a decent hard case and SWEET shock mount Very happy overall Looks great sounds great great price,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great This pedal works very good,positive
This is great product if you are chaining several pedals together Using just one wall wart you can power all of them at least those that receive this kind of power 9v Where it went above and beyond duty was providing a L6 converter CL6 for Line 6 products I have an MAudio Black Box which had a peculiar size plug It was 9V 1000ma but nothing would fit Then I tried the L6 converter and bingo Im in business and Black Box bliss I would recommend having it around just for that It costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you cant find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters A pedal junkies salvation Problem solver,positive
Ernie Ball is really on to something with the Slinky series offering a nice range of weights I swear by the Slinky after being conned into a a set of MexicanMade Martins Said it before SLINKY is the way to go for the acoustic,positive
I am using these strings on an inexpensive AStyle Beginners Mandolin these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument I strongly recommend these strings Highly Recommended,positive
Well built The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments 10 possible positions between upright and horizontal Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck Im using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the stand to give me a bit more room But there is no counterweight here so its best used at shallow angles If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar or if onstage energy has you moving a lot more I would opt for a boom stand instead Does what its told,positive

This pedal lives up to the hype Distortionwise it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type OD and a full on distortion like a Crunchbox or Rat I checked out several Youtube demonstrations before I took the plunge on this one I think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos more transparent and organic sounding I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly I also own a V1 Dano Cool Cat OD which is an excellent OCDish pedal but this one is getting more action these days I am running this into the front of either a Palomino V32 or a Jet City 20 watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup The pedal also plays well with others I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one The JF02 is a really nice dirtbox and not just for the price The fact that you can own it for 40 clams or less makes it a nobrainer for those of you who like myself are addicted to dirtboxes I have noticed some price gouging with a few vendors on here Shop around I knew the build quality was decent because I own the Joyo Vintage Overdrive and they are both built like bricks WOW,positive
The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs Ive seen heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singerguitarist This should come with a good 34howtouse34 course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications Good intro tool for recording oneself,positive
Didnt purchase this pedal from Amazon but wanted to write a review I wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good Is it a completely authentic acoustic sound Id have to say not exactly But its kind of close and its a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master which still sounds distinctly electric So far the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the Jumbo setting Again dont expect to sound completely acoustic its a nice way to at least approach that sound Check out some Youtube tests before buyingIts 34okay34 on my Blues Jr NOS but really shines on my Crate TD35 which is a brighter amp and less colored I zero the spring verb and use the pedals onboard reverb for best resultsUsed it with my Strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a Duncan Hotrod set Sounds good with both guitars especially neck and center positionsPedal is solid Be advised that it comes with the 9volt from the factory so if you use a DC power source then youll want to remove the battery To do so youll see a black knob at the base of the pedal Just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery Overally solid pedal as youd expect from BossA word of warning Not sure if its my setup but when the AC3 is in my effects chain not a loop but in front of the Blues Jr I started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning burnt tube or the like When I run it alone to my Crate I havent experienced this Could be any number of things in my effects chain so check if others experience thisIm wondering if a small cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal Never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp Not sure how a nonpiezo pickup would affect the tone Anyone know about this Digging this pedal,positive
I love these strings I get a much higher output much better response and much better sound Great strings for just a little more Love these strings,positive
I have had 34swing trees34 for many guitars for years Usually they cost 1015 This hanger is as good plastic base not wood like some others as any of the wood ones Comes with wall anchors but I usually look for a stud to mount on Soft cushioning Weight of guitar keeps the arms which swivel to allow for proper fit snug about the neck The thing came in 2 days and at 4 and free shipping it is a true bargain Killer price,positive
Im a man on the move and am constantly away from home I take this bad boy with me everywhere to satify my need to pick 6 strings great for takin to the beach or on the boat or to entertain yourself on long car rides Great Travel guitar,positive
This polish cloth is cheap and does the job of wiping your guitar down from dust or from use with cleaning products It doesnt scratch the guitar and works great Great Cloth,positive
This is the most Ive ever spent on a guitar strap But I have to say its well worth the price Very comfortable and looks great too Very nice strap,positive
Just slipped this windscreen on my mic a wireless brand and it barely fit perfectly Any smaller and it would be going in the trashThe foam is obviously of good quality and its plenty thick Im using it mainly to protect the mics metal screen but also to keep others germs off the mic seeing as how they tend to put their mouths on it Nice and thick Should protect your mic well,positive
Dont know what I expected for such a cheap price but this products quality is in line with its price Also the fit over my ukuleles fretboard is very tight making it hard to put on and remove Rather cheaply made,negative
The technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isnt very friendly Snark rotates to any position I want but Intellitouch ends up being upside down It works fine but its inconvenient OK But Not Great,negative
I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books This stand works great for me and hold even the largest of my music and tab booksThe construction is much better than other portable stands Ive used in the past and has two great features that I really appreciate One is its height adjustable and two is the tilting head The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad and this one works greatFor the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make Well built folding stand great for guitar music and tab,positive
I love these things They hold your guitars in place and make this storage solution a nice decoration in the process Works and looks great,positive
Lets face it in general string winders are pretty much all the same right WRONG I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name What a let down on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated sure you can press it back together but after separating several times on every string it gets a little oldquick Already ordered a different one to replace it One thing I cant stand is inferior tools Cheep fell apart the 2nd use,negative
I bought the wrong gauge I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong I bought the 90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound I dont know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils doDunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like newBuy em Good picks but,negative
The MXR CSP202 or Dunlop Custom Comp is exactly what Id been searching forFor years I played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system The rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards blah blah blah but these days everything I have sits on a Furman SPB8C Pedal Board Highly recommended and so Ive been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor and that is harder to find than I had previously imagined apparently they arent easy to make Ive been through 4 count em four foot pedal compressors and wasnt at all happy an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal MXR CSP202 so I did and its perfectBenefits1 Its easy to match your output gain on the pedal so when you step on it the pedal activates quality compression and NOT output volume suppression2 Its easy to understand right away 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and youre done 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3 Its quiet but very effective and professional sounding4 Its solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionNegatives1 Its expensive considering there are compression pedals for 12 this price2 Its got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackOver all the thing is a Home Run you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to but you cant fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one I highly recommend this pedal after a long process of searching and being disappointed Im glad I found this pedal Exactly right,positive
It has a 1950s slap back echo Its good for the price No putting It down for Sounding bad as with most Danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits If You want something that Is just reverb without all the slap back then Behringer DR600 which I use for Vocal for Guitar I use RV600 which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer Works,positive
What can I say lower priced than most and very low distortion I could Not hear the hum but for multi pedals to save on cost I use a godlyke power supply but this Is a good power pack Works,positive
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American PBassnot good My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekendThe problem with the design is theres a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab thats screwed into the body unscrewing itself Weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenonWe are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero unscrewing forceWe tried to make the Shallers work but just could not Maybe were all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us Horrible Design Friction backs out mounting screws,negative
I have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness No mud clear mids and highs with clashing Mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now Love it Wow Volume,positive
These arent usually my goto strings but DAddarios are a good solid sounding string They last fairly long when taken care of and dont usually break too often I DO like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing They will continue to be my 2nd string of choice as theyve not failed me any time Ive purchased them Definitely recommended Good solid strings,positive
This amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price pperfect amp chordfor home use,positive
These cables are just what I hoped they would be They work well on my electric and my acoustic Happy guy here Thanks Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable 10 feet,positive
It functions as designed It saves time when restringing a guitar Its made pretty well for a plastic tool Definitely takes less space than a wire cutter and a cordless drill to change strings Admittedly the cordless drill would be used mostly by luthiers but you get the point Nice device,positive
These microphones have a qualityfeel to them and they all worked perfectly I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed They dont come with cables so be sure you have some available xlrxlr You can get a 25 cable for under 5 also here on Amazon Good deal all around Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to Nice Set of Mics,positive
great value good quality and sound Very pleased with this purchase High value for low risk You will not be disappointed Banjo,positive
Very nice pop filter I use it on all my condenser mics It works perfect for those hard Ps and strong S sounds Its built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand It makes DeEssing a lot simpler when mixing vocals And it looks very professional I wouldnt be on the mic without it now that I know of the big difference it makes having it Stop And Pop,positive
Wow these cables are made really sturdy And the noiseless feature is priceless Definitely a real good value for the money Great Quality,positive
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar stringsi would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best the best,positive
Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone most metal pedals do and is moderately noisy If you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here Can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for I find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords For the price this pedal is a good deal though Good metal pedal but a bit muddy and sucks tone,positive
I love the pads and the knobs I used it with Live 8 The software side requires a bit of configuration to work with some software but ultimately was stable and functional EXCEPTWith my laptop the USB power supply must be noisy because the LPD8 will lose its connection and power if you even gently touch one of the cableshowever it works fine if I use a very cheap powered USB hub in between I suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply So it may not work in some configurationsLose a star because I really love it but in my configuration I am not willing to add a gratuitous USB hub and another wall wart to my road rig Nice try akaiUpdated update 12 jan 013I have tried a different LPD8 to compareit does not have the problem On the systems where my old LPD8 would be flaky the new LPD8 is rock solid It appears that I have a broken one with an intermittent problem If yours has this problem send it back while its still in warrantySo thats nice Now its really a great product that I can um sort of recommend to everyone However considering that AKAI professional has us doing their QC for them Id suggest saving the shipping box in case you need to return it for an exchangeat least for a few weeks MEchanically great electrically less robust,positive
This is a great cymbal stand sturdy tight well made using it with a 1834 crash and does not move or rattle amazingly well constructed stand for the price going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these great product I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all but it is a great stand for my studiopractice kit Being honest dont know how it would be for a gigging drummer but for what I am using it for more than does the job Strong and Sturdy,positive
It can be an octave divider up to two up or downIt can do parallel intervals a la Trevor Rabin on Owner Of A Lonely HeartIt can do intelligent harmonies just make sure your guitar is IN TUNE so it can track your playingIt can do Digitech Whammyesque divebombs up or downIt can do choruslike detuningIt can do whammy bar fluttercopiesIts a BARGAINIts very welcome on my pedalboardIf its what youre looking for its not Lexicon its not TC nor does it profess to be and you know how to use it you really cant go wrongGet one and have fun Because its not programmable Im getting another walletfriendly intelligent and friendly,positive
I like the tuner and Im definitely keeping it but the polyphonic aspect of it is pretty useless When you tune using the needle or LED version of a needle it will show each string as being in tune Then when you strum and use the polyphonic mode it often shows some strings are out And thats even when I use the neck pick up and strum with my thumb as the manual says to do But the tuner works great in the single string mode and I also like the drop D setting and the easy way to switch between the 2 modes It also has very cool and easy ways to adjust the 440 Hz pitch and it is very easy to switch to Eb tunings and other settings I also like the LED lights and the automatic brightness setting That is a very cool feature for those folks who still use batteries to power their pedals The tuner works great and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting So buy it but do it because the price is right and it works great as a tuner in the traditional sense not because of the polyphonic gimmick August 2013 edit as follows I just found out a feature of this pedal that I definitely do NOT like I dislike it so much I had to edit my review I wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in E flat So I set the tuner to the E flat setting as explained in the manual then I tried to tune All the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning It seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning I wrote the manufacturer they did get back to me quickly and they explained that the drop tuning functions ONLY WORK in polytune mode So if youre like me and you find that polytune doesnt work very well then basically all this is is a standard needle chromatic tuner that will not tune in any other drop modes LAME Excellent tuner but,positive
Nice strap for the money I ordered black but got brown Four Stars,positive

Ive just replaced the original plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this oneI had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail fileI was shocked at how much brighter the guitar sounded with only this single changeEven my wife who claims to have a tin ear commented on how much clearer it now soundsAlso the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated My piece arrived in a week thank you very muchFor the low price I think this will improve the sound of your guitar safely more than any other upgrade Improved the sound of my Squier Strat,positive
Ive bought a number of these for use on my Pedal board They have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone Recommmended if you dont mind a molded cable Good Product,positive
What do you expect for two dollars I use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics It took a little bit to shove the mic in and its just plastic but seriously what do you want for two dollars Its solid and it holds a mic the seller had it to me in a few days before amazon got me my mic stand if your not a serious on stage rockin mother you cant go wrong here Perfect for the price,positive
These kind of clips can break But if youre just a little bit careful not to push the microphone in too hard it should last for a long long time Just be careful,positive
I have a collection of straps but not a black one This one matches the acousticelectric I bought perfectly The pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have I would buy fromthis company again Thank You Protec Guitar Strap,positive
This is a highly featurefull amp at this price point I can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones Like most Line 6 products some features are not highly apparent For example for extra gain you can hold down the tuner button and turn the gain knob past 12 oclock for a boost This may not sound like much but it really CAN change the tone even on clean channels On the crunch channel for example it gives the guitar an almost fuzz face overdriven sound with my Strat On the metal channels it really drives the gain over the topThe tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are OK I decided to go with the cheaper FBV2 pedal which is still over 13 the price of this amp and it really works well for home practice situations One can switch between clean and metal or clean and blues without too much trouble one click I think the pedals are too expensive personally but they are well constructed solid steel and seem very durable The cable is a simple cat 5 network cable I believe so replacing should be trivialI live in an apartment and this little 15watt amp is WAY too loud to turn up past 1 or 2 It has a great tone balance to my ears It has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesnt Overall I recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp Great practice amp for the price,positive
This is a very nice product to use I would recommend it to anyone It is small enough to be out of the way while playing Nice,positive
This is a very good pickholder by Dunlop and looks much nicer than the regular Dunlop 5000 or 5005 It does what it should and looks more esthetical than the Dunlop 5000 or 5005 versions It does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005 It actually holds a couple of picks less It holds some 4 or maybe 5 picks while the 5005 holds around 7 if you use 060 gauge picks or lower I did the test just for the heck of it with several picks Since I use the Planet Waves Chrome Dome stainless steel picks Joe Satriani I only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one I am playing with so for me it does the job perfectly I have a nice 2013 Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top so I needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it The adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitars top if placed as instructed Place it gently no need to press it too hard Alean the surface very well before placing but do not use carnauba or any polishing material or gel before installing Just regular guitar top cleaner I use the PRS cleaner for example Cheers Good pickholder from Dunlop,positive
Use them all the time Has velcro too Goes from my DI or preamp to my audio interface Good quality Nice quality,positive
Im the lead singer in a band and I use an app on my Kindle Fire as a teleprompter This mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face The mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the Kindle fire and mount suffered no damage The mount is easy to remove as well Very Well Made,positive
Like the other one star reviewers my problem is that the head broke off I tried to glue it back on but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that If you buy this you really need to baby it My advice is look for a more sturdy model Broken head,negative
I purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear I liked the fact that it was open in the back so I could patch things in and out easily before I bought a patch bay I find it very sturdy and well made and Ive loaded it almost completely full I do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom Great studio rack,positive
I was looking for an Overdrive or Distortion pedal for classic rock and I finally decided on this one Its a decent pedal very solid However it is VERY noisy and buzzy when not in use although all of my distortions are It sounds a little bit thin and hollow to my ears its ok but I wouldnt purchase it again or really record with it Its very light and thin sounding Im probably going to get a FullTone OCD or something like that instead Decent,neutral
I recommend itthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityI like the sound it is very goodthank you for this product I recommend it,positive
I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar this strings have good sound and hold a tune well the best thing is the price is great Like I said I am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed great strings that dont break the bank,positive
I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor Maybe its a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand Im rating it for what it is sold as and for that it gets 1 star and only because since there is no zero Does not fit my electric guitar at all,negative
awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer this filter is awesome and for the price cant get any better awesome,positive
the best thing Ive purchase for my guitars this year Im not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning the 01 and 02 are the best restore the live of my fretboard the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine the only one that Ive just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i dont play with it after the cleaning but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioneryou can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase,positive
I really like it You have to have a Levys strap to use this but since they are the most durable and comfortable I already own two of them I never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor I check the battery level when I am not playing the strap goes over the leds but that is a minor issue Most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries I always use new ones so I know I have way more juice then I need for my practice or whateverThis is very ruggedly made I think it will last for ever I have an AKG WMS promini And this fits it perfect,positive
Looks good but disappointed that they arent made in the USA Oh well just shows me little by little more and more things arent anymore looks good but,neutral
Very good rosin and does exactly what is described A nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows No need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity Competes the need for,positive

I bought this to go with my Cecilio 44 electric violin and it fits perfectly It is not too tight nor too loose It is very well made This shoulder rest is very comfortable and really helps get the right playing angle Perfect Fit and Comfortable,positive
I like this capo because it goes on quickly and there is no pulling the strings out of tune A bit large for one of my cases but it still makes it in there ok Seems well made so I am not worried that it will break or need replacing for a long time Nice quick and accurate,positive
Ive had this for about 3 years and I agree with every one here that this is a fantastic amp at a good price point Its a wonderful sounding amp and gives you good chimey cleans and lush distorted breakup It only gets better as the speaker breaks in so make sure you put lots of hours on it initially and you will be rewarded If it was between this an a Blues Jr which are similarly powered and priced Id opt for this in a second I think the AC15C1 is actually a better blues ampOpinions vary of courseI only have a couple is wishes as theyre not really gripes One is the stock reverb Its really overboard in a way that I didnt find musical I ordered a new tank and now its great I hope Vox changed this out because I found anything over 2 on the stock tank way too much Second would be an FX loop Not a deal breaker as the amp takes pedals well but it would a good feature as wold be channel switching built in Third and last I wish it came with a footswitch to turn the Trem and Verb onoff and switch between the top boost and normal channels I know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice Probably one of the reasons its so affordableAnd speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an aby switch for this It allows you to switch between the top boostnormal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at the same time and let me tell you there are some really sweet tones when you run both channels at once Ive gone through a fair amount of gear in my time but dont see getting rid of this Its such a fun little amp that its nice to have around even if it were not my main goto amp Its certainly loud enough for small venues and jamming with a controlled drummer but its not going to shake the paint off the walls like an AC30 Highly recommended Great amp,positive
Whats not to love inexpensive and does its jobAfter reading some of the rather poor reviews I checked it out for signs of poor quality or workmanship Only thing I found was that the pin rockrd a bit there were three screws in the body that I used a screwdiriver to tighten up I suspect that complaints of falling apart could have been from missing or loose screws Not much of a chore I did back out the screws a bit and added a drop of clear nail polish on the threads for some insurance that it would not loosen upAnyway that is the view from where I sitJust got it and used it I will add to the post if things turn bad View from where I sit,positive
I have a lot of high end instruments and I live in New England so proper fretboard care is a must especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and dryingThis stuff is fantastic MUCH better than lemon oil dries a lot cleaner and doesnt leave any oily residue on the board at all An hour after its applied it sets up and doesnt get on your hands I apply it on occasion with the strings on I use Elixirs and have never once had a problemThe best few bucks youll spend on guitar care 5 Stars The best conditioner there is,positive
My daughter is learning how to play and the 11 48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal painI put a set of the DAddario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up Usually Ive had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch but the DAddarios seemed to do a much better job I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly The wound strings also seem quite stable Frequently it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in but Ive seen no such issues with the DAddariosI usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually likeMy daughter is also very happy with them since theyre not quite so tough on her fingers very nice extra light strings,positive
But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was restringing My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit moreRecommend Not a professional,positive
Um if youre looking for budget violin strings then you probably arent playing principle violin in the New York Philharmonic Me neither Im an abhorrent violinist but I teach Mariachi Band to elementary school students On my el cheapo violin these strings sound quite nice I would give them 5 stars but I think that would be overselling them a bit Theyre fine If youre looking for 5 star strings youre going to have to pay moreand ask someone who plays better than I do to review them for you Decent strings,positive
The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the jobMy only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere Panet Waves string winder and cutter,positive
5 feet is a weird length for a cable It really only has one use When youre sitting right next to your practice amp Just dont wander too far off This cable is perfect for a kid who is going to hisher guitar lesson and has to plug inI bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between I feel chained to my workstation Just my experience Get a 10 foot and be freeHope it helps Too long and Too short,neutral
I had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acousticelectric I was so used to the big klunky ones that you balance on your leg while trying to tune I had no idea these even existed After using it to tune 10 different prospects in a row I decided to buy one on the spot the tuner that is it took another hour to decide on a guitarIt is very easy to use the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment I like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if theres a dropD song or just tweak something that goes out of tuneDoes exactly what it is supposed to do and it stays out of the way Portable accurate works great cheap,positive
It could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr but it does what it is supposed to Works well,positive
Nice strings Great soundBut rust easyI had issues with the packaging I used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jacketsYou have to use all of the strings once openedThe cheapo Musicians friend strings dont have these issues they are individually wrapped in plastic jackets and I dont have to use all of them at one go Nice strings but have to use all once opened,positive
Ive tried a lot of strings and these are my favorites although I use the heavier MLT 2036 strings sometimesThese ones bend easier The heavier ones have a better low end and buzz lessBoth last as well as the more expensive Ball and Gore elixir coated strings I have usedAnd I like the sound better My favorite strings,positive
I have used daddario for a number of years Im not hot about their acoustic but electrictheyre a whole new world I like these nickel on my telethey give them that extra twang Top notch,positive
It is not the size for mini guitar May be for the big oneConnections are shaky You will surely notice that the quality is toooo low Choose something else,negative
Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge Overall simple and effectiveHowever I may have added too much humidity Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar caseI do use a hydrometer but I dont think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar but only the inside of the caseSo I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it No drip humidifier,positive
does not work for all guitars one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway I have tried though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should strap lock but not for the rounded holders,positive
Ive had one of these Ive used for years and it has served me wellI needed another so that I could get more headphone mixes out of my soundcard for recording multiperson bands in my home studioSimple to set up you get an input for your source and 4 outputs for 4 people to listen to the source and each one gets to control their own volume Small Powerful Inexpensive,positive
I was buying a pawn shop guitar when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar I didnt expect to actually use it but what the heck I could sell it and make a bit of money back Got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the Frontman 25 just to see if it worked I was surprised to find out not only did it work it sounded very good I own a Deluxe Reverb all tube amp and the little Frontman 25 had the Fender sound What really was impressive was the reverb it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound I actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well I normally use a Blues Jr for small gigs but the Frontman did a fine job On some smaller gigs when all I need is a little reverb I just plug straight into the amp and it worked well plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus its small and easy on the back All in all very impressed and have decided to keep it I would easily pay full retail it is a nice little amp might even see if I can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it Impressive,positive
These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother toneUnfortunately these picks did not receive a fivestar rating because of their price and lack of durability They wear down fast Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I dont think I play particularly hard At around 450 for six picks these are some expensive pieces of plasticHowever these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra I will definitely be buying more Superb guitar picks but serious durability issues,positive
I bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings The sound quality is very good from these mics in fact its hard to distinguish the difference on nonpro mixers from other higher end mics They feel good in your hand nice build quality and if you put a windscreen on them there is very little pop Sensitivity is good and Im very pleased by this purchase Id definitely recommend these for any kind of audio recording they may even be a good option for instrument recording given the lower price tag NOTE once you put the pop screens on they no longer fit into the carry case You have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case Great sound nice quality,positive
I tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both I didnt think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp It appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner I would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet I dont know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tunerUpdate The more I use this tuner the more I like it It is easy to read and use and doesnt appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was Of course I am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used Appears to work fine,positive
Very pleased with this item It really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom Definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole This thing really works,positive
It fits well close well protects well transport well What more can I ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases Have not have it that long to rate the durability but I like this case Happy camper with a case,positive
It works and it works well It easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc No damage to blades when cutting heavy to light gauge steel strings If you change your own strings this cutter is a must have It is very durable the material is made of high quality metal and it makes clean cuts The rubber grips are comfortable to use and have red accents and therefore easy to findMy only minor gripe is that it is springloaded to open Ive cut myself with the blades reaching into the pocket a few times when I first got it Thankfully I dont change strings too often I also made a little leather pouch for the clipper end and I put a rubber band around the handles to keep it closedA musthave for your guitarbassukulele bag Highly recommended A very handy tool to have in the bag,positive
I like the sound of this pedal It gives my ss Fender Princeton chorus a good tubelike sound I have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy I prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs The TO800 gives me the sound I like without breaking the bank I havent used batteries in it because I use a 1 spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard If yourethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger You wont be sorry Great pedal,positive
I was given free picks when I bought my guitar from a local guitar shop in town The Retailer gave me some mediums I find I do better with heavy thickness I have a heavy touch when I play the guitar With the different thicknesses I can choose which works best for me From experience it never hurts to have extra picks around Since I bought these I have been using the Heavy thickness ones They really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar nice to have a variety of thicknesses,positive
i purchased the 38mm and these 46mm after using the 38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area not too much but at least something excellent,positive
There isnt much to say about this product except it works as advertised If you dont have one of these and you are a live performer I highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up pun intended Necessary,positive
Ive owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super OverdriveSweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well I have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal It really does react to your playing style Unlike other overdrive pedals Ive used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of theminstead of a tone knob they call it focus there is also a volume and drive knob The sounds I can get out of the Sweet Baby are some of the best Ive ever used and easy to dial in I own a lot of pedals but lately I keep my chain setup real simplethe guitar goes into a EHXCrying Tone wah pedal then the Sweet Baby then a Boss Super Overdrive used as a lead solo gain boost I dont use Distortion pedals next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp I use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed I play mostly Blues and Classic Rock The Sweet Baby is well made and I dont see it failing me anytime soon You can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this clone overdrive tone blenderUpdate this pedal has since been returned It went out with me on a few gigs and didnt hold up to life on the road The connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigsI have since put my Boss Super Overdrive back in the chainwhile I truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for And a Sweet Baby it isuntil it died at the gig,negative
Ive been playing with this a lot since I got it last week It really is versatile as well as noiseless Ive mostly used it with the default settingsI havent had the time to tweak it as much as Id like but I can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it Really impressed with this wah One mean piece of equipment,positive
I started experimenting on strings I say why wouldnt I try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar Awesome I like the brightness of sound it produced Im hooked to bronze strings Thanks to Martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings Martin Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings,positive
I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more Im hoping they last a while Awesome,positive
Came with more screws than i needed They were the right size No issues Thanks You shouldnt be disappointed with this item More than I needed to do the job so thanks,positive
This Fender cable is the perfect length for me Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I dont mind The build quality is great and I know that it will last The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily requiring me to tighten it oftenSound quality is not affected and the color is cool definitely try this cable out Durable Instrument Cable,positive
Great strings Bends are easy Stay in tune well Shipping was fast and Id definitely recommend these John Mayer and other of my favorite musicians use these strings there great Awesomee,positive
Very accurate When I wanted a G I got a G I have such a refined ear that I only have this around if I have a head cold or you know dont want to show off but its a good tuner If you need it its Great,positive
Awesome tuner really fast and responsive Best of all it is accurate enough so that using this for setups has resulted in a much quicker easier process than I had anticipated Nice and bright so I can clearly see it on stage in the dark Occasionally I get a small pop when I engage it but not that frequently This pedal feels good and sturdy too I really cannot see anyone breaking it unless you feel the need to leap from the monitors on to the switch Price is easy enough that if anything should happen to it I would not think twice about picking another one up Hey am I in tune,positive
Excellent tone and Im a bit surprised by that I mean DAddario strings are fine and all but thats it theyve always just been your average basic string to me These promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver I strung up my Agile AL3000 best Les Paul copy you can buy look them up with them tuned up and these things roared Rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain These strings really do feel and sound great I never thought Id be praising DAddario so much but these strings really do deliver Great strings They really sing,positive
Just what I needed for my Home Studio Monitors that sit on the table next to my Computer and my DAW system was surprised at how many different versions I was sent they all work well thanks heaps These Do the Job,positive
I have an electro acoustic Martin second hand but without a scratch I got it with 13 strings and well is simply too much Is good to play rithyms but cant do pretty much nothing elseI have installed a set I got 8 and it sounds really good Not as solid as the 13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easierRecomended Sounds Perfect,positive
A guitar player can never have enough of these things around These picks hold up well that says alot because I am not easy on picks if any kind PK,positive
My guitar just Love it This stand is exactly what I hoped it would be It is all I want or need from a stand Cant complaint,positive
Idiotproof compact extremely sturdy All metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand LED readouts Runs on 2 AA batteriesFeatures that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPylePro PCT10areTest tone function which sends a known volume signal down the line Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipmentIntermittent issue indication This is what made me choose this model If theres even the shortest dropout the LEDs indicate it Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshootMy only complaintsThe a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife Quite frustrating Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw and managed to get it outTheres an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back This clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous Luckily I have no need for the clip I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screwNo rubber feet on the bottom metal enclosure battery cover screw sliding around and marring whatever it sits on I stuck some repurposed rubber feet on the bottomAfter the few problem solving situations mentioned above this thing is a 5 star product Too bad they couldnt go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box Good value,positive
After having collected a few guiters through the years I needed the kind of stand to hold certain ones in particular Never enough stands,positive
I had a Line 6 POD that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that I considered a few different brands and even other Line 6 POD models I even ordered a POD XT only to cancel that order when I realized that you can download tones from the Line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrievalAs many have said the batteries that come with it did not last long at all but that was kind of expected I have since been using Energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs plus I have a 9 volt AC adapter that works great especially when I am recordingTo use it for recording simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and youll be able to record with all the tones you could want I downloaded a Joe Satriani sound and am so happy with it that I have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds greatI am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough but I found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to 34grip34 better and stay put so that it doesnt slide right offI am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with I dont play live so I cannot say how well it would work for that So Glad I Bought This,positive
Excellent bag for tripods or stands that dont need a lot of protection You have feel multiple microphone stands or maybe up to three speaker tripods in this Affordable and easy Great buy,positive
I bought the wrong packWas supposed to buy the lightmedium pack but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best My favorite pick out of this bunch was the Dunlop Jazz 3 pick It would be great if the item name was changed to like Dunlop 12 MedHeavy pick variety pack but that might be me being too picky Cool variety,positive
I was hoping the Lemon oil would be what I needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but its not very good at that I suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry Once clean the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood even where years of playing have taken their toll Its a good finish but not the place to start The product is not meant to be used on maple Dont know why but not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark exotic woods So far so good Not Mr Clean,neutral
In case youre wondering about the difference between this Hohner harmonica holder and the Hohners costing more than twice this ones price this one is made in China while the others are made in Germany Now Im definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of Chinese made products I have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there This item however has some of the good AND some of the more stereotypical problems of Chinese goods Pros Cheap Sturdy And unlike some reviewers I love the taller height Far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe I also like the tighter springs though that does take a little getting used to But the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort Now the Cons Its true what others have said the plastic neck tube smells Not as bad as some have said but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable I cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at TAP Plastics for a buck make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee I got the 12 diameter 2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is NOT bent evenly Mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other and the neck loop was WAY off I did my best to bend all parts to even but the flat metal part is tough to shape The reason I didnt return it is that I figure most of them are equally uneven I just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand with little or no machine help to ensure consistency With the work I did on it myself it works fine and is now fairly even and like I said the taller height is just about right for me Its just annoying that some of the most basic expectations arent met like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides All this said the bottom line is that I prefer using this OVER my German made Hohner holder because its better ergonomically taller holds my harp more securely and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the nouveau single butterfly nut design of my more expensive German Hohner Knowing what I know of its drawbacks Im still tempted to pick up another as a backup or spare Its a great deal if youre willing to do a little work on it Does the job well for cheap but requires a bit of work,neutral

If youre looking for a 12string acoustic then what more could you want than the Epiphone DR212 The craftsmanship is excellent the sound is fantastic and its easy to tune and play right out of the box Add the limited lifetime warranty and Gibson support and this guitar cant be beat The price is amazing for what you get and to top this all off it has been chosen as a Guitar Players Magazine Editors Pick You dont have this guitar What are you waiting for Order it now while the price is this low Go ahead Go for it You wont be sorry What more could you want,positive
This stand is great for my 45lb Peavey 1500 It is a light weight rack and I had to put the amp toward the bottom I wouldnt put much more in it but it is exactly what I needed I can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily Havent tried gigging with it but if you are gentle I think it would work fine Very Nice at any Price,positive
These replace the OEM tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock They look fine When I get the guitar back together I expect that they will work properly Delivered on time as promised Exactly as promised,positive
I bought a second pair of these All I gotta say is that they do their job for a good price Good stuff Good stuff,positive
I bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home he has guitars everywhere I am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars It is pretty good at staying in place though Handy for temporary hold,positive

These are the best strings you can buy IMHO There is hardly any noise whilst your fingers slide over the strings when you change chords I tried other strings but I always come back to Elixir Guitar strings,positive
USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability The reason being is that they are condensers for one and the other is that this mic has a built in interface An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and Analogue to digital and digital to analogue ADDA converters Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer way way better So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and youThere are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracksThe really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal quick easy and affordableOne of the problems with using it in Pro Tools or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time Since the mic has a built in interface you cant use any other Even in Garage Band for MAC although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one Some other MXLs like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end When bottom fishing for a gooddecent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellersWhen using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold There are also output adjustments as wellOne other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I couldnt get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software free 60 day trial also downloadable from MXL So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel and then Sound and then type Troubleshooter into the search box in the upper right corner The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero I moved the slider up and bang it workedSo for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into its a mini jack like you have on your computer So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for podcasting or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic Great For Its Intended Purpose,positive
They work great with my pedals Not sure if its the pedals or the cords but I noticed with my full rig and using all the cords there is a noticeable hum in the background Im sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well I can deal with it Need some cables for cheap Bruh Get this,positive

I recently bought a bunch of picks of different gauges and materials for a shoot out I think you have to see what kind of tone you are looking for yes even in a pick sorry guys but for me this material and gauge had a full sound without being thin and the material feels best in the fingers I previously used 63 gauge acetal Claytons Pick Some Up,positive
Often we get what we pay for After researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks I chose solid items for reasonable pricesI shouldve known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle the quality of the cable This item simply didnt ever work it arrived with a bent pen on one end and even when we attempted to straighten it it didnt connect well onto the mixer board The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the micDont buy this item spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand Very poor quality pins were bent,negative
Nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume Numerous reviews posted on Amazon Sweetwater Sound and Musicians Friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark This is 60W miniPA that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully if you have a quality mic There are package sets with this amp by other sellers on Amazon that bundle cables and mics et cetera recommend steering away from that and just buying the amp from Amazon and getting a Shure SM58 or other quality mic seperatelyMany reviews talk about the durability and how easy the amp is to ding and scratch cosmetically I see potential for that too thus the need for a carry bag mentioned below But I dont see this as a big downer and I personally dont mind if it takes on a road worn appeareance after bumping it a few times If appearance is your thing shell out the extra 200 and buy a Roland or FenderShop around click around if you buy 34items sold from Amazon34 you can depend on Free Shipping If you buy from sellers THROUGH Amazon you will usually pay shipping and the overall pricetag will be bigger And as Ive stated on other reviews other sellers that sell through Amazon sometimes ship slower or make mistakes with shipping so know that going in On your major music retailers sites this baby is going for 360 to 380 Got it to my door for 304 I really cant say enough about the ease of shopping trustworthiness and quick delivery of items sold by Amazon 5 stars just for service the fact that the Amp is awesome makes it that much betterYou probably wont be able to find a carry case that fits this amp but I bought the Singer Black universal Sewing Machine Tote for just over 20 and its perfect It fits the mini snugly with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals With my current setup I can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands and thats really neat The closest amp case would be 100 1x12 combo case that wont fit right and would take away from the whole portability thingYoure not going to find 20 lbs and 300 worth of quality amp anywhere else When compared to other makers FenderRoland nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets and I understand why Recommend without hesitation And as with all my reviews if something goes wrong down the road Ill edit the review to share But I expect that this amp will meet my needs for a long time to come Does what it says,positive
Needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag This one fit perfectly Its adjustable and allows me to fit a clampon microphone boom arm Saves space at cramped gig sites Dont lose the wing nut though It tends to fall off since you must completely remove it to break the stand down for transport Not worth lowering to 4 stars though Exactly as described,positive
Guitarists have become a bunch of corksniffers There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless boutique pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to stock gear or anything that doesnt cost an arm and a legThe fact is that if youre a gigging musician and I am you come to realize that all those subtle detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix and in the poor acoustics of wherever youre playing Yes we want to sound good to ourselves because thats inspiring but frankly I dont need 200 dollar distortionOD pedals to be inspiredI havent owned a DS1 in a long time but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget Frankly Id forgotten how musical this pedal is With the distortion set to minimum it never gets clean its a good moderategain overdrive that still lets your guitars basic tone get through I play a strat and jazzmaster those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing With the gain at halfway you get great ADDC crunch And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords What more could you want Sure its old school rock distortion The usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you wantI also have a Barber LTD great relatively cheap boutique moderate gain OD that doesnt break the bank and a Visual Sound Route 66 which is a tubescreamer clone with much more gain and a compressor in one pedal Both the LTD Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump though much less pronounced on the LTD Whats refreshing about the DS1 is that the strong mids are there but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party The tone on the DS1 can get very bright but as I indicated I play with single coils and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob I generally run it around 91000Overall this pedal is a steal look around and find a used one for a good price Id considered a modtone Speedbox but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead for basically the same price I couldnt be happier Does what its supposed to do very well,positive
This thing is awesome really nice looking and heavy duty Costs a few bucks but is very high quality seems like it will last for ever Classy looking and Hardy,positive
A good value box set of quality products Use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape I do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy Great Value Box Set,positive
While ordering a guitar case the guitar strap popped up and I could not pass up the deal I found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good Great deal,positive
I like these short planet waves cables for short runs where there wont be a lot of abuse going on They have good quality connector jackets similar to Monster cables There are better made cables out there but few are in this price range Good quality cable for the price,positive
It cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand It is very solid and will last a long time A Handy Gadget,positive
I was looking for a financially good deal The price was so reasonable I said How can something this cheap be that goodwell they were a great investment I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone When I told them the price they thought I was pulling there legI wasnt The case is plastic foam and clips Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself Id buy these again in a heart beat I just might buy another 3pack Cardiod Microphones,positive
It works It is cheap It does the job well A review mentioned it didnt come with batteries Mine came with batteries I highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews Excellent,positive
The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great It will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty I cheap buy and it works excellent A Must for a Double Kick,positive
Easy to see Easy to use Easy to get used to The display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound that is what makes it so useful You cant beat the price for such a great little tuner Amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience I will be buying one for every guitar case I own Easy Easy Easy,positive
Perfect for my guitars Sounds great for my telecaster and my Stratocaster guitars Capacitor are a nice generalized choice Excellent choice Sound great,positive
Unlike those who have complained that they dry out fast I have always gotten much longer life out of them than the product promises What I cant tell you is how well they actually meet humidity ideals because Ive never monitored the humidity in the case to see what it is and if it is on par with what the manufacturer says I have taken it pretty much on faith that they deliver what they say and they have read some endorsements by people like Bob Taylor of Taylor guitars that they work Bob has too good a name and no incentive that I know of to be frivolous about endorsing such a product that might not work so I take it that Taylor had his lab people check them out thoroughly to be sure of Humidipaks effectiveness before Mr Taylor would give them an endorsement That was good enough to sell me But I didnt just buy it because Bob Taylor says they workthey occupy a very cool niche which I was hping someone would fill Planet Waves Humidipaks are for the person who is willing to spend a little extra to not to have to keep fiddling around with water sponges gauges and those Oasis water bag and just have something that you can dispose of and replace every so often Thats what I want Sure water is free But it evaporates fast and its a job to keep having to take care of So is it worth it to buy a disposable thing like this that you dont have to mess with Or do you want to save 15 or so by doing all that work wetting sponges and whatnot weekly Ill gladly pay the extra few bucks not to have to worry about hydrating my guitars and cases but once avery 6 monthsNone of my guitars have shown any signs of humidity issues and I have lived in New York City and Virginia Beach in the years since Ive been using the Planet Waves Humidipaks One accolade that I will give Planet Waves is that they did recall the product a few years back and promised replacements when the new model which resolved a potential leakage problem was released That rerelease seemed to drag on for a while and when I contacted Planet Waves to gripe they sent me a check for the list price of all the units I had returned to them Well the list price was three times the retail price at the time and that was a bit of a minor windfall at the time for me which impressed the heck out of me and I used the money to buy their other humidity products in the interim to humidify my guitars But when the Humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements ANYWAY That was really being treated well by Planet Waves and I have never used anything else but Humidipaks since Humidipaks give me peace of mind that my guitars are being humidified and Im more than satisfied with how long the paks last Ive used it for years and heres my take,positive
Should have paid the extra 40 and bought the Mustang oh well The amp has light sound and not much control Good for my small space though Small amp,neutral
Works great For the money you cant go wrong with this effect Im using it more then I thought I would when I first bought it The only thing I dont really care for is the stomp switch which is activated with more on a touch then a click Seems like it may be a weak point of the pedal but so far its held up fine Fun,positive
I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them This one is my favorite turn on and go I think its better than the Sovereign Best distortion of my time,positive
I bought this ac adapter for my electro harmonix od glove pedal this ac adapter works in many pedals a great option buy one Planet Waves 9V Power Adapter,positive
I like those guitar picks and their colors they are well designed and useful it comes with different shapes and colors that makes them easy to locate if you lose them on the floor or anywhere useful,positive
The Yamaha keyboards that take batteries dont come with an AC power adapter No problem I got this the week after Christmas and it works like it came with the keyboard OEM every time,positive
When my case arrived I feared it was too small to hold my Epiphone Dot But this case fits my Dot like a glove The case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitars finish The accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings Excellent Hardshell Case,positive
I originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that so I tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great Its so much better than the elastic capos So its doing double duty and going strong Works great for my ukulele,positive
This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils pens clip on tuners capos etc It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page I love how a pen capo or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is 34trained34 to stay in place A must have five star item So essential it should come standard,positive
Just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this Classical From the moment I took it out of the box I was impressed The finish was really nice and the sound is awesome Seems to stay in tune pretty well too For under 300 you cant go wrong Excellent Guitar,positive
If you are a beginning guitarist like myself you probably cant tell one note from another This product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately The only thing I needed to know but didnt was that if you get a reading of G and you need to make the reading B for the B string the notes follow the alphabet from A to G and then begin again So you are turning in the right direction from G if the next note is A The one after A will be B Seems simple enough if you know anything about music I didnt Great ProductEasy and Accurate,positive
I bought this used off a friend when I got my first Electric Its a great little practice amp that is plenty loud enough for a small room The destortion works well enough Bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine Input jack has held up real well so far amp is about 4 years old nowand the speaker is pretty clean My only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough I cant practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv I suppose a set of headphones would solve this problem but then its something else I gotta plug in and worry about I find that I like the sound of the overdrive better especially thru my Epi LP but just cant play it low enough I end up having to turn the overdrive off and then turning the amp up loud and turning the guitar down real low If you have issues with volume control in your house then make sure to get a set of headphones or else you could suffer the dirty looks and the banishment I have suffered All in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point For practice it works,positive
Good sound very very low noise except on high gain when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half expensiveIf youre planing to record on computer buy a USB mixer for the same price youll get a lot of stuff and a mixerWorks with iOS if you have an external power supply powered hub Good but expensive,neutral
Price is great Works perfect Comfortable and looks sharp Not the least bit stiff like some leather products My first experience with Levy and completely satisfied Thank you Wayne Strapitup,positive
I use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars good brand and good tone 5 stars for this one good price and good quality,positive
I have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups Some peope miss the 34quack34 electric guitar type sound from these other types I do not I also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified nor is any battery required I run it through a Baggs Paraacoustic preamp or my Fishman AuraIt really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctlyProduct was delivered safely and promptly Most Natural Sound for the Money,positive
Like many here the case could be an inch bigger For my Ibanez 510 I cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back Now mine closes without pressure on the bridge GOOD CASE BUT TOO TIGHT A FIT FOR MOST,positive
Hohner Marine Band Hohner Special 20 and Lee Oskar Major Diatonic harps fit well in this case Hohners Big River Harp does NOT fit properly in the case it is longer than the others and doesnt snug in Ill either return the case or order two Lee Oskars to replace my two Big River models Or I can just deal with the fact that they dont fit quite properly but probably good enough Decisions decisionsHavent played the toy harps yet first things first I bought the case for the case not for the included harps NOT ALL HOHNER DIATONIC MODELS FIT THIS CASE,positive
These picks are great the best part is the 72 pack I always have spares This is a thicker pick I would recomend you actualy try one before you by 72 of them The only complaint comes from my wife since they tend to pop up all over the house You can never have enough picks,positive
About ten years ago I installed strap locks on my first guitar Fender Stratocaster They worked well and were easy to install I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation I had to drill additional holes no two guitars Gibson SGs OuchThis made me take a second look at Schaller The components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than Dunlop It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results I went from Dunlop to Schaller,positive
Ive been using this mic cable for over ten years and it had come up missing after an event I looked everywhere I could think of and thought I had lost it for good One day I happened to look between a ball of TV cable wire in the rehearsal room and there it was I didnt remember where Id gotten it or even the manufacturer Although I have more than a dozen mic cables this pliable cable with its own elastic clasp was always my favorite I was ecstatic the day I found it after months without it and now have a backup I highly recommend this cable Great cable at an affordable price,positive
I always put my recorder on the stage on a mini tripod that would get kicked over by band members Now I put my recorder on my monitor mike stand and dont worry about it anymore Simplicity at its best Better than sliced bread,positive
These cable are perfect Ive bought much more expensive cable that didnt have the quality of these They even had velcro reuseable tape to hold them 2 each Perfect amazing price,positive
No onoff switch is a bummer but it works Solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenienceUPDATE After playing in a small shed for a while the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a B note We messed with the PA and all the electronics What it came down to was my mic PylePro PDMIC58 Professional Moving Coil Dynamic Handheld Microphone placement I switched mics and kept them in the exact same position and the rattle went away Whats all this mean The quality of this mic is just ok If youve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one Decent,positive
My goto string brand for any stringed instrument Punchy roundwound tone but very responsive to the tone controls for a more muted sound where required Daddario what more need be said,positive
This is a great glass slide but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced My finger stays too tight Not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out Its great but make sure you get a slightly wider one,positive
I bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar There is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state this is a solid state People will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a 400 tube amp to practice through 34Youre not getting the right tone man34 The problem with that is there are several companies out there Marshall Fender Vox Orange etcand they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one So I figured before I committed to a company maybe I could just use this Fender to emulate some of those sounds I wantThat worked out beautifully Though I am very much a beginner I have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amps eq can have on your guitars tone I thought I needed pedals to have some of these effects instead I can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flangerreverbmodulation I need I have got to the point where I understand about how just adjusting my volumeswitching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when I want toI would not have been able to do that without this amp This amp helped me develop as a beginner so I wouldnt waste money buying other things beginners think they should get Excellent amp and I recommend getting this over the Mustang II Save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more Practice amp that lets you learn about other future amps Yup yup Want to try pedal effects without Commitment Yup yup,positive
I cant say enough good about this amp I have a Marshall jcm 800 2203 which is a great tube amp but side by side this little amp really stacks up First and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp But if you want something that is 90 close well this is it So versatile light weight and well constructed Great Fender quality for a great price Love all the presets I have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise Excellent guitar amp and I would highly recommend Love it Buy it,positive
Planet Waves has built its company making affordably priced accessories and these patch cables are no exception I bought these at a local Guitar Center for about the same price The thickness and connectors seems to hold up well although I may look for a slimmer alternative soon as some other reviewers have stated also that the connector ends are a bit large and could become difficult to work with in smaller or crowded pedalboards Good cables for the price,positive
I purchased this to work with my ION system and my shure mic Arrived as expected very solid great fit It works No problems,positive
Really love this product works well helps me stay in tune quickly is helping me to train my ear to hear when Im in tune snark fan,positive
This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo This has the most distortion It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with It is solidly built and apprears road worthy great pedal and great value I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product great distortion,positive
I have one setting that I like and the only button or knob I use is to turn it on or off Would never use it to record but for the price it is 100 an awesome choice Totally sufficient for a live situation if your amp doesnt have reverb or you just want to easily turn reverb on or off Is it the best sounding reverb No but its solid and totally acceptable for live performances,positive
I have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market This metronome has 2 distinct audible sounds and a flashing light which makes it much easier for me to see and hear the beats Works very well Excellent Metronome,positive
I cant compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own And every student Ive ever had has one on their guitar as well They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time they can be easily removed and relocated After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others No matter how many picks you store or for how long the spring action loader never loses its resistance I highly recommend these I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks this is the product for you Great pick holders,positive
I have used these strings since they first came out DAddario make the best strings out there I am sure there are others who do a good job but you can actually hear the difference It doesnt really matter which you buy they all sound different as in better The best,positive
Dont like that its difficult to change the tube Sound quality was not what I expected maybe because I wasnt familiar with the settings No power cord was included in mine or manual Manual should have been include not sure about the cord Dials are very small My MIC200 and MIC800 are much better than this I cant say its bad Just that there are better choices in my opinion Didnt work out for me,neutral
This stand is great It is solid but light weight enought to move as needed The footprint is small meets are needs well Guitar Stand,positive
This has the largest top of any of my stands and it is the one I use when traveling gigs The top doesnt fold like some of the more expensive Stagg Hercules stands so if youre using it for gigging that may be something to consider I have to lug an 88key weighted piano around so dont mind lugging this good stand,positive
This pedal is OK it has all you need in a reverb the controls are simple and the sound is good there are other much more expensive units but this pedal can be compared to those expensive units the sound is digital clear and the features are basic it is worth to have one to have fun with I recommend this product DigiTech quality is top of the line so you dont have to worry about it in general a very good unit DigiVerbanother reverb pedal,positive
If you buy the keyboard youre going to need the power adaptor Sucks that Yamaha runs this scam of not supplying the power cord and making you buy it separate but I suppose the nickle and dimes really add up for them Power cord fine Yamaha shady Yamaha PA130MM 120 Volt Keyboard AC Power Adaptor,positive
Ive had this for 4 days and Im so glad I bought it Its basically a top end 2 second delay with whistles and bells you wouldnt even think they would be on there I have had ALOT of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the 2 second loop capabilities Dreamy,positive
Overdrive that wont drive you overlove it for the price as usual danelectro delivered I love their products for that reason they sound like a couple hundred bucks and yet Drive on over and get some,positive
My wife got this for me as I tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions THis is the neatest little light I have ever seen It takes 3 AAA batteries included but I did not find them until I was tossing the package out And has 2 nice LEDs The lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music The clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand Battery life so far has been at least 8 hours actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also I love the ease at which the lights are adjustable A real needed item is you play in darker rooms THe answer I was looking for,positive
It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my makeshift panty hose pop filter What else is there to say Works as a pop filter should,positive
I have several different tunes but the Snark is hands down the fastest and most sensitive Has no trouble whatever picking up the low estring on my Seagull acoustic which flummoxes my Intelli 600 Having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier The only down side and this is a matter of taste is the garish color You shouldnt leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away which may be just as well Fast and accurate great little tuner,positive
Ive been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners This is by far the best Ive ever had Not only is it accurate and easy to use but its so convenient Simply clip it to the head of the guitar press the only button on the unit and start tuning Also unlike other tuners Ive used this tuner does a great job of filteringignoring ambient noise in the room I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation even with the TV on in the roomPros Vibrant easy to read display No need for cords chargers even when used on electric guitarsbass Simple one button activation Lightweight I leave it on my classical guitar all the time especially after restringing Auto Shutoff also can manually shut it off just press the one button a second time Works for Guitar and Bass both acoustic and electric and violin Also works on my UkuleleConsWish I had this 20 years agoBottom LineThis is a nobrainer The price quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist Fantastic Tuner A must have,positive
Just an all around nice case good construction good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver This isnt one of those semi walled cases this is just a normal gig bag Works for me in fact I bought another for my classical Great Case,positive
And works well for it My only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal I dont know how long it will last I might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole But the price is right and the stand is solid enough All areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last Mine is for my banjo,positive
These pins are amazing One u never have to worry about breaking them They look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain Very cool Really nice product,positive
I needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass These things work really great I love them Great Transaction,positive
Ive been using elixers on my Godin Multiac Steel SA for many years now They have a great nottoobright sound and you dont get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings These tend to last me about 3 months So I am very happy with them They also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there All in all I really like these strings and think they sound great great strings,positive
This switch does work but you should look before you leap The switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3way switch and if you use the common Fender replacement control plate or one that was only intended for a 3way switch it may not fit You could fairly easily alter the plate but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate Make sure your control plate fits,neutral
Love these picks pretty much the only ones I buy now nice and flexiblegreat for picking great for strumming Recommend you try them Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks 12 Pack Abalone Thin,positive
I used to have a regular guitar strap on my bass but when I got a regular weekly bass gig and was using it more often it started to feel like the strap was digging into my shoulder Your mileage may vary on that but I decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bassI read a lot of reviews and decided on this one some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable but this one was usually reviewed well It was the perfect choice This strap needs no wearingin its supple and soft right out of the box The leather on top is smooth and classy looking and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder The wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps All of this adds up to a great deal of comfortI use Dunlop strap locks on my instruments and with a thicker strap like this I had some concerns about getting them on there but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap no problemI would highly recommend this strap for any bass player or even someone with an especially heavy guitar This is the comfy reclining chair of straps,positive
These are a direct drop in replacement on Fender Standard MIM stratocasters Fender American Standard Fender American DeluxeI have replaced my tuners of this style with Fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the backUnfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish But you can get them ultimatelyI ordered a set of these nonlocking ones the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fenders schallers gold hardware not all gold hardware is the same color gold The quality is good and they look and function well However I returned them because they are not lockingI ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar I was buildingIf you just want gold tuners dont care about the string locking feature and are playing a fender strat or tele you cant beat these By comparison to a lot of the gold tuners the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too Good tuners great price on amazon wish they were locking version,positive
Bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job It adjusts easily and doesnt look bad either nice inexpensive strap,positive
These cables seem to be qualitymade I purchased them to go with my two microphones also in the same Amazon orderI have yet to try them with my microphone good product,positive
Great harmonica rack for smaller harps Very strong in the set when worn A must have for any folk player For when hands are busy elsewhere,positive
I ordered two sets so that I could set everything up in nice orderly progression on my stomp box Heard no evidence of hum and they seem to work just fine keeping everything in orderBy the way these are listed as 5 feet 6 but actually are 10 Wish I had measured as I ordered a 12 long cords thinking they would be twice as long Oooops my bad when I discovered they were only 2 longer Just perfect for stomp boxes,positive
Bought this with a mic and foam cover and stand and it all works perfect Geat value for the money My daughters use all of them every week Will buy more in the future Need to have,positive
This is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price So certain compromises have been necessaryCompromises such as a singlesupply wall wart partly an advantage to get the AC out of the amplifier itself and very basic circuit with inexpensive parts The preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges and has no provision for load adjustments or the likeOn the other hand it works well is packaged nicely and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy but want a basic phonoRIAA amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs Also by avoiding the ldquoallinonerdquo tendency of units that include inexpensive DA converters and such for USB output this is almost certainly cleaner for the analogonly uses for which it is suitedThe unit is also very ldquohackablerdquo if youd like to upgrade things like capacitors resistors or the opamps Or use a nicer external power supply the first thing Id upgrade Lastly if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge and the capacitance of your phono cables you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordinglyRecommended if your budget is limited Amazing value if limited budget for phono section,positive
This is the first and only TC Electronic product Ive ever purchased I watched the Youtube demos and liked what I heard It has exceeded my expectations The reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak The Toneprint feature is amazing I downloaded Church of Andy preset from the TCE website and just love that patch Downloading is quick and easy I created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available Hall of Fame patches so whenever I want to change it out I dont even have to go on the Internet to get it There is an iPhoneiPod4gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal Dont ask me how it works but it does I will probably buy more TC Electronic pedals in the future Absoulutely the best,positive
For the price these cant be beat At this price it doesnt hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency Excellent,positive
This pedal works well and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation A little goes a long way with the sliders and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful Nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq It makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each otherTen bands is a little overkill for guitar Three of them are outside the range of the instrument but I bought this one because I like that it blinks if clipping it has the extra volume and gain sliders and comes with the AC adaptor This adds no noise that I can tell except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already thereIts an all around quality product that I imagine Ill still have twenty years from now Solid 5 star product,positive
I bought this to go with my Epiphone ukulele for both myself and my grandson Its a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp For the price its good GOOD STARTER AMP,neutral
This is by far the best delay effects box Ive ever used and it has so much potential that itll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers Its also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end It is built like a tank and doesnt take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very userfriendly pedal Wish all pedals were built this way Highly recommended All You Could Ever Want In A Delay And More,positive
ive had these straplocks for a few years now and they havent failed me once i love them and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so they rotate in full circles and are super durable you should buy them for all your guitars and youll never have to worry again they are also very easy to use and 34install34 you should definitley buy these,positive
Good value Good,positive
I use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there It was a pain to take out too However it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar It did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall I had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole Something you might want to think about before getting one of these Nothing to brag about,neutral
DAddariowhats up These didnt last long at allI dont play my Martin very oftentoo busy with electrics but these were trashed in a monthGuess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now Never purchase again Lackluster at best,negative
This is a great capo I had been using Kyser QuikChange capos for a good portion of my ten years of playing but they had their limits For one intonation wasnt always right and my guitar especially my electric would go out of tune frequently After trying others I settled on the Shubb and it outguns the Kyser in every aspect Its features surprised me It is small and incredibly light weight you almost cant tell that its there The adjustable knob is great and allows you to dial the capo to the right pressure so that you dont get any annoying buzz Also my tone has greatly improved which is an awesome bonus making my acoustic sound much clearer and much more defined as opposed to the Kyser which I noticed muddied up the sound Even though you have to make some adjustments this capo is still easy to use and is one of the best investments I have ever made The best capo out there,positive
The adjustable tension is a great idea and the openclose lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and wont get in the way of your hands unlike the capo I had before this one It even comes with a handy pick holderI could make this review longer but what else do you really need to know If you have a nonclassical 6 string guitar acoustic or electric this guy should do the trick regardless of neck shape Its a very well designed capo As good as it gets,positive
I have purchased various lengths of these GLS cable to patch my rack equipment They are well made reliable and cost effective The XLR connectors are secure and I couldnt purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less The colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light Nicely made handy patch cables,positive
The width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide Attaching it is a snap The suede gives it a nice grip to your shoulder so the guitar doesnt slide around Very comfy easy to install great strap,positive
Works perfect for guitar strings Used it when I restrung my Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6 It has locking tuners so I was able to use this to cut the strings all the way down Convenient and useful,positive
These really arent a very good value If I had to do it over again I would probably get Wilkinson locking tuners which are much less expensive and a lot easier to install If money is no object and you need the F trademark on your tuners then I guess these are for you A great product but,positive
My Hartke 410VX Cabinet was designed by an idiot9 million pounds and no castersnot even holes for them Who invented this thing HeMan Anyways I bought these casters got out the drill and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp pounded these in and now it ROLLS Sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when I push it like a car missing a wheel But its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing Of course we practice at the drummers house and in his basement so I still have to carry it down and up his stairs but thats life Great CastersMy Back Appreciates Them For The Most Part,positive
Ive been using these for years Tried others but I prefer these Id allways come back to Daddarios They just sound good Im satisfied Great sounding strings,positive
In writing a simple review for such a simple product theres only a few concerns you should have 1 Would the adhesive dry out on this and 2 does it wear over time The answer is it gets 4 stars It doesnt dry out but I had to replace mine after 5 years because it eventually wore out Thats pretty good Not perfect but pretty god double bass pad works weel wont fall off,positive
unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights These are no different I would prefer to use cables with better shielding but cannot justify the expense considering how rarely these things get used Standard guitar cable,neutral
I bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo Strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel One person may love them the next may not They are very playable strings but on my aluminum rim saga banjo the sound was a little to bright I took them off and put them on a another wood resonater banjo they sounded much better on that one One reason I buy these strings is they are made in the USA Why buy strings when they dont tell you where there madeI put on a set of Daddrio medium set and liked the sound better but they are a little harder to playAll strings must be kept clean if you want them to last wipe each string when done and they will last longer Good for beginers,positive
Dont know what it is but I love the sound of these strings placebo Maybe but IMO these are the best sounding strings Ive played with Love Fender Strings,positive
This is the most comfortable strap I have ever used I have been a guitarist and bassist for over 40 years and although I have only been playing banjo for a short time this IS the most comfortable strap I have ever used The clips look solid and so far they are solid Great strap,positive
I used to use the Tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these I ended up using that pick for something like 3 years playing 12 timeswk Once I started playing 4hrswk at my church I decided that this pick had proven its self so I order a small box I have never dropped one of these and have never broken one FYI I generally dont play hard and I always play acoustic Nanoweb custom lights Tortex now these,positive
I bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum Should work just fine I also bought the green one Does what its suppose to,positive
I wouldnt be surprised if a big time professional musician might be able to tell the difference between this and the Shure it imitates but for our amateur purposes it was bad to the bone good Works as intendedgreat for the,positive
Its very useful Looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand very durable as well Very useful,positive
Bought two for a shockingly low price that I couldnt beat anywhere even at double the price Quality cable sturdy user serviceable connectors well constructed and 6 months of daily use with no issues What more can you ask for Very good for the money,positive
I only had this board for a day after realizing it was a tab too narrow for the pedal setup I wanted to create on it I do have to say though Pedaltrain makes rock solid products Sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother This thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro Very Solid Little Board For Minimal Pedal Setup,positive
This thing is awesome I think its the best tuner Ive owned and it really does an excellent job Its easy and clear and everything a tool should be Its fast and easy just like a tuner should be Awesome little tuner,positive
These tuners are so convienient and I have yet to see a musician I show these to who who doesnt appreciate its simplicity Gave this one as a Gift,positive
The wire clipper and winder work OK but the pin puller is badly designed and doesnt slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out Bad design by someone who doesnt use it to pull pins out of a bridge I end up using a Jim Dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out Ive done it successfully for years Disappointed,negative
These picks seem well made and have a solid feel but Im not sure I like the sound of them Like so many other guitarists I go through a lot of picks searching for what feels and sounds the best for what I do I dont this is it for meat least not on acoustic Whatever I didnt like about them got drowned out when I tried electric Since Ive been playing more acoustic lately I might or might not buy these again Really Nice Picks but,positive
This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 14 inch audio plug It doesnt snap in place Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out That makes it fairly useless I may have simply gotten a defective one The input jack is too loose,negative
I use this for working on my guitars mainly It does the job well and is pretty large Its very soft and padded as well as anti static Guitar mat,positive
I have a few Shure SM58s which cost more I like the open sound of the PG48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the SM58s I like this mic ok but the SM58 is worth the extra money I think especially if you expect to push its capability Good for the Price,positive
Bright tone If you have a dead sounding ukulele as is sometimes heard in laminate ukes or you want added volume the Aquila strings are second to none There are other wonderful strings Fremont flouros Worths etc but Aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound If you own a less expensive ukulele under 300 and it came with noname factory strings or strings known to be of lesser caliber than the Aquilas strings such as Martin GHS etc please just try a set of Aquilas and you will hear a major difference There are internet videos showing the painstaking process of making these Nylgut strings in an old factory owned by a middle aged couple in ItalyWinners Wonderful Italian made strings,positive
classic fender heavy picks i love the fender heavy pick and now my picksknobs and inlays are all shiny abalone what can you say,positive
I use this to mount my Stagg Small Musical Stand to hold a small format mixer for gigs Its light weight and sturdy Sturdy little mic stand,positive
Im in love with the dual design system It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly There is one downside to this system as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time One component which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions werent much help either The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go but I didnt know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there After that I installed this into my new guitar and strap and I was ready to go I HIGHLY recommend this It is much easily to switch out straps wo the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process GREAT Straplok system,positive
This unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording It is powered via the USB bus so you dont have to carry power supplies or worry about finding an outlet for the deviceOne issue is that this is not a plugandplay device You will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it After the driver was installed I was able to get Pro Tools to recognize it right away without any issue I recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded It works like any other interface in Pro Tools so you will be able to use it easily enough The mic preamps dont seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones I use to record vocals and guitars I found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay I wouldnt want to use this for anything important but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals or doing preproduction in a practice space I wouldnt recommend it for serious studio work though and I would rather drag my Pro Tools IO rack to a location if I was in the fieldThe build quality is a bit suspect on this as well I noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when I picked it up after taking it out of the box It seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose I can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound This can of course be taken care of very easily but I would rather have a device come as it should I have never had a problem with a TASCAM unit before and I have had a ton over the years so I hope this is just a oneoff quality control issue The knobs feel okay but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is stickyBottom line 35 starsRecommended for casual use but not for commercial use Functional but not great,neutral
This is a great analog delay analog meaning youre not gonna get a lot of crazy sounds and delays that last forever If youre looking to get creative with lots of weird sounds get the Boss Digital Delay This pedal is intended to just color your tone a little bit and it does so in a spectacular way Im very pleased with it Great Analog Delay,positive
A bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made I dont think that you would go wrong Anything is possible,positive
Is this guraunteed for life or something it should be for the price it is very basic tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up I would not buy another one at the prices they charge but then I am handy enough to make my own if I wanted to The carry bag is very nice the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff They show a lot more pedals than I could fit on it they must be smaller pedals than the ones I can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between If you look at the picture there appears to room for 6 pedals but 5 is all you will get I have a Boss RX20 double pedal looper and 2 other Boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables Overpriced but it works,neutral
I love these picks they are my favorite I bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year These picks are sturdy and wont break that easily I use them for rhythm runs and even lead They are perfect for rhythm flexible My only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold For lead these sound dull I much prefer a brighter more chimey soundOverall great product Get it Love them,positive
This is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as I do Ive tried other types including those that I made myself but I much prefer this one I find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitarsfrom Fender Takamine Ovationsetc For the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling Highly recommended Planet Waves Guitar Headstand,positive
The U30 is a decent starters ukulele no matter what color you get but it is not without its flaws The tuners feel cheap but they are functional much better than friction tuners on toy ukuleles The body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers The string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns Even for a soprano ukulele this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more Hawaiian sound but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic unless using a microphone The worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings it takes forever to stretch them or break them in This means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner Chords that use the first fret such as F and A sound distorted for some reason Replacing the included strings with Aquila strings makes this ukulele much better but the added cost puts it in the price range of what I would consider a true starters ukulele the Lanikai LU11 The included gig bag is almost useless it has absolutely no padding and is very tight In conclusion its low price and distinctive high pitch Hawaiian sound make up for its shortcomings I would not recommend this as your only ukulele or even a starter since the problems with first fret chords will train your ear in a wrong way I would recommend the U30 as a backup or disposable ukulele that you can take anywhere without fear of damaging or losing it but for a little more money you can get better Better than a plastic toy ukulele but not by much,neutral
This guitar is probably one of the best I have ever owned The tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings You might need to adjust the neck a bit and some new strings probably wouldnt hurt but my god What an amazing guitar GREAT GUITAR,positive
What do you say about a little chip of celluloid Well almost everyone I know who plays has a preference in guitar picks These do it for me I like the look and more important I like the feel in my fingers and on the strings They also seem to make a good clean sound I use an Ibanez electric and a Gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars Maybe its all in my head but these feel good to me using any of my guitars Good pick to pick,positive
This pedal is outstanding for the price The feel is great and it doesnt move at all when you put it down on the floor The only thing I disliked was that it doesnt support half dampening like most of the higher end pedals around this price rangeI got this for Christmas of 2007 and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studioGreat product Outstanding Product,positive
This bag was nicer than I expected for the price Considering that many soprano ukuleles are in the 20 t0 100 range a lot of people wont want to buy a hard case for three times the price of this gig bag or for more money than their instrument costThe case is better padded than I might have expected for the price Since soprano ukuleles are small and lightweight instruments its not clear to me why a hard case would be as important to most people as it might be to somebody evaluating guitar cases or cases for other larger instrumentsIf you have a small child who is likely to sit on the instrument or drop it down the stairs constantly you might want to consider something better But this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls For a soft bag this offers all I would ever need Nice inexpensive bag,positive
A little bigger than my other pick holder so the pics arent as fluid sliding in and out Great price though Good,positive
I normally buy DAddario Strings here I buy the 011 or 012 strings This is my first time playing Ernie Ball since I first began learning When I first started on guitar I put 009 electric Ernie Ball on my acoustic so I could handle the pain and keep learning Then I went to DAddario strings I wanted to try these since the under 5 price is goodThey sound nice They dont sound as crisp as the DAddario strings They sound more mellow and not as BOLD They are 8020 and I prefer those to the other strings out there I cant say I love them or I hate them I will probably stick with DAddario since I dont find any difference in them I bought some other Ernie Ball strings on Amazon that I will try soon For the price I would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them I dont think they sound bad and if they do it did not cost much to test them enjoy They are good strings,positive
You need nothing else to replace your string no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar or both I have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you like me dont like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustacheRecomended Is a great product,positive
I honestly dont know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too Ive seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more This is a hard shell tolex covered case They are sturdy well padded with plush black lining and look as good as cases costing much more These cases are made for dreadnought guitars and I bought two of them One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys Its made in China but isnt most everything these days I wouldnt recommend it for airlinerailroad baggage but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions I dont think youll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else Dont be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases Bang for your buck,positive
Good cable as good as any expensive brand Thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded No complaints at all Good guitar cable,positive
For the price this product is ideal I find myself wishing I had ordered more It is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly I shall probably get three or four more Will get more,positive
I was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own I am a huge devotee of Dunlop strap locks having dropped both my electric guitar and my bass on stage at one time or another I have now installed these on all my main performing guitarsSo it was a given that when I started gigging with a new bass I would put strap locks on it But I already have my fancy bass strap decked out with the lock mechanisms so I really only needed these buttons I was on the verge of resigning myself to buying the whole set again and throwing the extra strap lock parts into a drawer when I found these Buying the buttons alone cost less than half what the whole set would have and now I can just shuttle my one bass strap between both instrumentsI did have some major difficulty getting one of the two screws all the way tightened but since I have attached strap lock buttons at least four other times and it was easy as pie Im more inclined to blame my instrument for thatGreat product Im elated to know I can now get these buttons separately This is the best,positive
The question was 34Did it meet your expectations34 and it certainly did It is heavy duty but also light Well placed on a light duty cheapo stand it might be a little heavy but and basic quality stand will handle it no problem It really seems well engineered and made of quality material High quality heavy duty still reasonably light,positive
Incredible quality and valueThese cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than I expected for the priceThey use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed They employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each endThe dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables and the color coding is a big plus as wellNot only is the product outstanding but I was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure I was happy with the cable setI am so pleased with this purchase that I am a customer for life You get the best for less,positive
Everything keeps improving and getting better faster and cheaper but at this price point their isnt one available that isnt a compromise in one way or another First off if you are planning on buying the US322 dont Buy its bigger brother the US366 Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money as well as 192k makes it a nobrainer To get optical on the 366 only at this price is great but the AD DA converters leave a bit to be desired On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good have distortion ratings THD of only 00045 and with 24 Bit192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to dateWhat I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres and weak clocks or vice versa and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa etc I researched interfaces for a long long time and considering noncrash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 20 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in 30 out Now thats an interface I have been running it with Pro Tools 9 since 2011Pro Tools 10 Professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and Pro Tools 11 is now being releasedSo if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another Rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope I would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved So what I did was load and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver and doing updates for both I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface and therefore they didnt need to spend much time with it I dont blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesnt happen in just one hour So here goesIf you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP 7 and 8 I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare nonfunctional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well It works in Win 7 just fine So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64 In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content Groove Agent One Vintage Beat Boxes Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc creating a Steinberg account which is free and they dont ask you for a credit card They provide you with an activation code after you registerI have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program Cubase does not require that you have one although they have an equivalent looking device but fortunately they have a software based equivalent They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6541122 There is an eLicense control setup and you have a Soft eLicenser number that you will use in order to generate the Activation Code generated at the Steinberg site What came on my disc was version 605 which they instruct you to immediately do an update which I did to version 607So we install the Tascam interface next which comes on a separate DVD Included with the interface is a 5 foot USB printer style cable You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver So install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update It took at least 15 minutes to do that update What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving At first it says This is going to take a long time and they were exactly right It almost tempts you to think something is wrong because nothing is happening other than the scrolling and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says Do you want to install and you click continue and then it comes up again in another minute and this happens a few times and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash Then you rebootNow this is important Plug the US322 directly into an available USB 20 port and not into a hub even if it is a powered hub It simply wont work I tried it and the light wouldnt even come on indicating USB When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 11 The US322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide There is also an owners manual for both the Interface and Cubase that are available either on the DVD or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading There is a driver to choose input and output settings as well as going into Windows Control PanelSound in order to choose the interface for playback and recording If youre new to these kinds of setups just take your time and dont be dismayed if something doesnt work All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you wont get any sound from the headphones If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US322 and then click on the support tab and they have a you pay for it phone call number in order to help you Hope this helpsPS The real killer deal right now is Avid Pro Tools 9 bundle with the MBox Mini which is another limited interface but you are getting Pro Tools 9 Plus purchases of this bundle made after 102011 that has pro tools 9 will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools 10 if you register your product with Avid Considering what Pro Tools goes for by itself and what the MBox sells for individually and the bundle even comes with the iLok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts I have seen pop up as much as 20 off the already low price Then you have Pro Tools 9 and 10 full blown versions none of this LE stuff and an interface and can grow from there This Tascam interface works great with Pro Tools These Pro Tools 9 bundles are discounted to make way for 11 and I am seeing music stores running out of them They are clearing the shelves preparing for 11 but it has bugs I rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some and get feedback from users After some time and more updates I will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to 11 maybe in another year PT 9 is all I need Setup Tips If You are New to a DAW and Interface Hopefully This Will Be of Some Help,positive
Basically very good The buttons are fairly intuitive but some basic functions are incongrously hidden beneath multiple layers of menus The sound recorded while crystal clear is a little on the quiet side even after adjustment of the record and play back features Useful but has limitations,neutral
I bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music This was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well Very nice,positive
This is the best case ever for the money I have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the Gator Deluxe I like this case so much I plan to purchase two more this week Best Case Ever,positive
Nice overall with a good sustained ring from the steel strings 12 and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings 36 I like the sound I get on my Yamaha acoustic Nice ring a bit metalic,positive
Got what I needed a basic capo for a good price The tension is a little tighter than Id like but works for me Covers all strings and depresses them fully I dont use it often so I cant speak to its longevity but good for me Basic capo,positive
I use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over Its worked great Very happy with it Its not a 2000 quality mic but it its a good mic for the money Some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter Great Condensor for home use,positive
This mic is great I have one I have used from coast to coast to coast to coast Unbeatable in price and quality You cant go wrong with a brand name like shure I have had mine for 14 years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box You will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal As a veteran bluseman I recommend it It rocks As clean as a marsh possum Clean As A Marsh Possum,positive
A very decent capo Switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly Great for someone who plays on alternate tunings or someone who likes shifting scales often Very nice,positive
I had always wanted a phase shifter but I never wanted to pay alot of money for one because its not something I had to have but I just wanted one The reason I bought this one was because it was cheap I got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool You can get some insane sounds out of it I mean some are so insane I asked myself what could someone possibly use this with in a song But its great It does what it is suppose to do and it is a sturdy stomp box Couldnt ask for more Worth every penny,positive
I bought these to put on my really old Martin acoustic The guitar still sounds amazing and these strings certainly fit my budget and provide a great sound Excellent strings,positive
This pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly It was a good purchase I recomend it Good performance,positive
Been using these for years I like the Regular Slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer Or it could just be in my head Either way I am happy with them Tried and true,positive
I bought this cables to use it on my guitar pedals during practices and live gigs I have no complains about it at this time I own and use other hosa products and i think that they are making products with an excellent quality for a lower price100 recomended Good quality cables without noise,positive
Good quality cable I have other cables around it and was unsure about its shielding but have never noticed any feedback or hissing Seems like it works just as describedGood delivery time too Good Quality Cable,neutral
Arrive on time and as described I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist Pretty well all have their favorite set of strings What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type andor brand So I reckon each has to find their own So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find 34the ones to love34 Back Up,positive
Decent strings but the little E string broke while I was stringing the guitarOther than that they appear OKNothing to rave about Ernie Ball 2223 Super Slinky Nickel Wound Set 0942,neutral
SLAP THESE PUPPIES ON YOUR TEN DOLLAR SQUIER AND YOUVE GOT YOURSELF A 2000 GUITARId describe the sound as a bit 34metallicish34 definitely a sharper tone SOUNDS LIKE THE STRUMMING OF A MILLION HUMMINGBIRDS,positive
For some reason these picks have a better feel flexibility and grip than any I have found in a long time They arent that expensive especially as an addon and theyre relly cool Great Picks,positive
Not sure how to rate this tube Replaced a Chinese preamp tube in my Champion 600 and couldnt tell any difference in tone Maybe it is built better But thats yet to be seen I did put a EH6V6 in with the Chinese preamp tube and did notice an improvement but the EH6V6 only lasted five minutes and shorted out So i sent it back I ordered a TS 6V6 and am still waiting for it Maybe NOS is the way to go with the preamp tubes Time will tell TS 12AX7,neutral
These are the original perfect fit on my american deluxe strat so durable I got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful D good stuff Perfect fit and durability,positive
I really like this foot controller because you dont have to reach to the amp all the time to change channels I wish i had the big USB cable but i cant find it in Walmart This paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but its gone now Anyway this thing is nice if youre too lazy to reach to the amp to change channels I think the product should have been around 7080 Really useful paddle,positive
fits just fineI have two electric guitars and one bass nothing can take it down you will see it recommended Hercules,positive
I have written other reviews about elixir High quality strings Great for acoustic and electric No complaints on these strings Great,positive
