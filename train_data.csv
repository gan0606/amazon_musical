Ive tried so many other strings over the years just to see if I was missing something I wasnt Theres something about the feel and tone of Ernie Ball Regular Slinkys that I absolutely love My local music store has 3 for the price of 2 deal on strings which is a nice deal however this deal is a little sweeter If you can wait for the delivery its a no brainer Very good value,positive
This cuts strings with no problems It doesnt take a lot of pressure to squeeze the handles and it doesnt damage the cutting blades like some wire cuttersHighly recommended for frequent string changes Stays in my case,positive
Probably the best capo I have ever had Its easy to put on and holds the strings well Although you always need to check the tuning after putting any capo on a guitar this one seems not to upset the tuning too much Im impressed G7th Performance Capo,positive
im not a profesional player but i like to play once in a while just for fun and this sound great Everything a hobbiest want,positive
These strings are great for a 12 string I started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel A 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have They sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string I have used on this guitar And I think they will last longer Which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring Perfect,positive
Im a total beginner so I dont really know if my review will be useful I have nothing to compare these too except my Lee Oskar They sound good to methats whats most important right These do have a kind of nasty 34new car smell34 to them but Im leaving the box open to see if airing them out helps Its not a big deal but its the only negative I can find with them Rock on bro Now I have all the harps I need,positive
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works it is what i expected it to be seems fine,positive
I had a hard time lineing them up to install the little knob on them made it very hard to installso good luck Hard to install,neutral
It came in nice packagingCable looks great feels of high qualitySo far it still works well10 ft is nice for homeIf youre a performer longer is required As good as Advertized,positive
Very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful I just had to loosen the screw that holds the winder a bit and lubricated it with silicone spray and done deal Works Well,positive
Pretty cool gadget a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles cans or sprays and does on a set of old strings Gig bag neccessity,positive
This was for a friend who needed a Guitar Capo He hasnt had any problem with the capo yet And the price was right Guitar Capo,positive
Cant get your banjo to sound right without a great set of finger and thumb picks have been using these for years now Banjo essentials,positive
I love the Dunlop Formula 65 polish and cleaner It works really well and I like the easy to use pump spray mechanism Ive used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles This one works almost like a mist It does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints I spray it directly on the surface of the guitar and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth After Im done the shine looks glassy and great Makes guitar look and feel new,positive
First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last For this price it is a Do Not Recommend for me Not Impressed,neutral
This mic is well made heavy on the micend However I have yet to try it with my multitrack studio good mic,positive
In this price point its a good capo if you know how to put one on and use it I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it so Im not losing my G7 capo which was 40 Great capo For the price great capo,positive
First let me tell you what this pedal cant do It wont do long delays So if youre into the sound of The Edge from U2 or David Gilmour look for something else Expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile But if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience this pedal will not disappoint Analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic Users of MXR Carbon Copy swear by them But for around 30 the Rogue pedal will get you close minus the longer delay time Ive read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the Belcat and Modtone boxes The pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal Compared to my digital delay the Rogue sounded warmer although my other delay has a switch for echo that made it warmer too This pedal sounded good and I have no complaints I dont use a long delay time in fact I dont max it out I only use about 7580 percent Before judging this pedal please experiment on its placement on your pedal board The user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately it doesnt sound good on my rig Placing after the distortion pedal sounded better However everytime I use the dirt channel of my Traynor YCV40 the tone gets muddy Now its in the effects loop just like my other delay The sound has better definition It might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion then after the distortion and finally the effects loop in your amp Ultimately you and your gear will have the last say Overall a good deal for the price Im thinking of setting up a smaller board of 4 inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome And if anything goes wrong I can easily replace the pedals Joyo Rogue Mooer Play on Another budget surprise,positive
I wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig or just in my office I did a LOT of research into devices that were USB only even other ones that Focusrite sold The main reason I picked this one was its versatility in being both iPad and USB compatibleThe complaints about the iPad connector cable are valid its too stiff and short I feel like I might accidently break it off if Im not too careful Why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit Ill never know To combat the included 30pin cable I bought a10 3ft 30pin extension cable which seems to do the job nicely The GarageBand software on the iPad is simple enough to use and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time thats fine for what I expected To record from a live soundboard I just use the XLR input set the gain with the awesome colored halo ring and save the recording as a mono trackBeing small and solidly built Ive got no problem tossing this in the milkcrate with the rest of my cables and peddlesIn regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via USB an iMac in this case its even better than I expected The GarageBand software on the Mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time The onboard monitor volume and headphone is fantastic I thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment but it does more than that Its a real monitor the GarageBand software recognizes its the monitor output and when you have a multitrack recording that youre working on the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new trackFor example I recorded a track with just the guitar track 1 I was using the 14 input channel and laid down that track Then I created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part headphones plugged into iTrack Solo and I was able to hear both the current track I was recording and the first track Lastly I plugged in a mic into the first input and created a 3rd vocal only track When I was singing I was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the iTrack Solo as well as my vocals recording in realtime I wasnt expecting this level of capability and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals I was recording with all 3 going at the same timeThe last thing I want to mention is the XLR preamp Focusrite has been making highend professional recording equipment for a long time and the thing theyre most wellknown for is the mic preamp I have to say it is spectacular There is absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks of any kind The gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup its almost too easy The sound it captures is exactly what you expect and youll notice right away if youre using a low quality microphone It definitely stands up to their reputation Having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have The demos on their website show how simple it is to use Once you start playing with it youll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist or someone who wants high portability but great sound quality Portable durable and GREAT mic preamp,positive
These Nandy mics are great entry level mics if you are looking not spend to much cash They have a long range and great sound fidelity If you are trying to save on your budget these are great if money is not an option keep on looking Great entry mic,positive
This works and I really like Evans But I got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap Although I have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse Works not great,neutral
Very good quality cable and plugs Easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft My pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that I actually made room for 1 more because there was no extra wire to get in the way Custom Cables at a low price,positive
I have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for 20 years I can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the James river I used to take my 700 Ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing The Ibanez is heavy where this Rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money I want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere I go When it dies i will buy another one You cannot use this for performance of any kind but for yourself friends and family around the campsite or wherever it is perfect Great little disposable guitar,positive
Great device and good priceMy Wife made me try this for a Gig we had It worked great I love the foggy effect on stage with a touch of lighting it really comes to lifeThe fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though Perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice I dont know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but I have another can of juice I bought to use later I will report on thatI gave it 5 stars although the fog juice is funky because its not the fog juice that matters its how the machine works It does what it should do Great Device Good Price,positive
This is my second 4 way switch and it wont be the last The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 12or 3 I am very pleased with the 34new sound34 of my tele The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun dont forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder Sounds great,positive
These are perfect for those using Dunlop strap locks but have more guitars than straps These are Allparts parts quick USPS shipping More guitars than straps,positive
I now have two of these really wish now I had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase kicks self and all I can say you simply cant beat it I also have a Hercules Tristand 10x more expensive than this one and between the two gotta admit the only major advantage my tristand has is saving space which actually is a huge consideration for me I honestly dont know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two Musicians Gear Tubular Guitar Stands I currently own never once have given me an issue aside from bodily running INTO the thing and they have helddo hold a variety Guitars of various styles Banjos both open back and BG resonator Mandolas anything with a long neck All in all unless there is some specialized stand need I would first come to Musicians Gear All purpose stand best bang for the buck,positive
This pedal fish and chips which i find it to taste nothing like works nicelyAnd was pretty cheapIve heard some complaintsworries about the flimsiness of the plasticAs of 0313 the plastic seems pretty thickdurableThe switch does seem of a poor quality but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourselfAs for noise It doesnt seem to add much unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high and with distortion and what have youI havent gotten to blast play bedroom level technically since ive gotten it but it sounds good through the headphonesIm using a squire strat fryette sas distortion now the fish and chips boss me50 all running into for now my vox vt20 which is outputting to my headphones sooooIts sounding nicer that wayI cant wait to get it through my other ampsIve also heard of very very short battery life Ive got the standard 9v i think from planet waves and its powering it just right so farTomorrows the real test a few hours at least Seems good,positive
Cant believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector This is now a boat anchor To buy a 3 meter cable from them they charge 40 for the cable 15 to ship it and then tax The extortion here is almost Monster cable like These folks should be embarassed Old 30 pin connector makes this thing worthless 54 to get one,negative
I started experimenting on strings Ill try using bronze strings I noticed when I was using the phosphor bronze after a while it started to sound dull When I switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer I decided I would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time I would recommend others to try it The best bronze acoustic guitar strings,positive
This is a very stable comfortable seat The legs are easily removable for storage Love that it is rated for higher weights so I dont have to worry about it collapsing Stable,positive
the thing is that they dont seem to stay i mean you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic 34arm34 but it doesnt stay where you put it and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality but i think if youre lucky if just might get the job done mmm not that pleased,negative
Great pedal very lush and usable tones Think Lightning Crashes by the band Live Ok I was going to initially give it 4 stars because of the following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does not click very miniscule volume drop with engagement actually I moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and I think that resolved the volume issue but I cant tell I guess if it is too close to tell then its a non issue Then I performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again Metal enclosure Works like a charm Twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping It gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price Think Lightning Crashes,positive
this picks are great for hard rock since they are heavey but not that heavy for solos I play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great Great for metal,positive
Look just like Schaler branded parts without the Schaler brand name stamped on them there is a little Fender logo on the bottom real coolThese strap locks are the greatest they work perfectly every time and will survive years of on the road abuse I have carried an extra set with me in my case in the event that I broke one but this has never happenedTouring bar bands garage bands or bedroom heroes all need these strap locks on every guitar and strap they own And since the guitar isnt hanging by the hole in the strap the strap lasts years longer Great parts just like the Schaler counterparts,positive
I thought it was my jack for a while then I noticed it wouldnt stay in any pedal There is no click assuring that the cable is in place and theres a reason for that it isnt Slips right out of every pedal I have Not reliable Plug slips right out of any jack,negative
I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this I saw it in the theatre I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happenedbut had no idea if this would be as good as all that Never fear you need to see this film The guys prove that the hype was legit I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like For Your Life even if the performances of Dazed and Confused and Stairway seemed a little pedestrian But hey its LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99 of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance The show seems to get better as it goes along and by the time Kashmir comes on I had tears in my eyes No joke This show is riveting I bought the BluRay so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show which really defies description I am not sure if nonLZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is or what the band accomplished in doing this They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70s If you love LZ you probably already have this set if you have a passing interest only you will witness a onenightonly reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era Its pretty awesome Led Zepsilences the doubters,positive
I purchased this for my guitar lessons studio to teach beginners how to string their guitars properlyTo my surprise I am very impressed with it now it doesnt compare to a 60 100 unit nor is it supposed to it does its just quickly and cleanly A must have for any guitar player,positive
For a ten spot ya cant do better Matte flat black finish is niceGreat durable foam contact points for cradling babyDouble dog dare ya to do betterYou just cannot Excellent deal Sawbuck Best Bud,positive
so cheap I bought one for each of my ukuleles would never use a pitch pipe again and I guess I might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these I love snark tuners,positive
Brass Tacks is this the greatest mic in the world No But on a budget this mic is AMAZING The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out If you are looking for s nice rich sound this is itIf you want to upgrade from a headset cheap mic Blue Yeti or AT2020 buy this mic and an audio interface You wont regret it Wonderful,positive
So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound qualityI have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones Rode NT1A AT2020 SP C1 and they are clear but so sensitive that its difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room So if youre like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a littleI did an A B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 I love for vocals with the exact same processing chain cable settings etc and just switched the mics out I sung the same passage as well and I have to say the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B If I didnt have this new microphone I would still like the SM57 but the Genni is out of the bottle now so not going back The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very wellDYNAMIC SINGERS Rock Jazz GOSPEL OPERA If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you dont buy the SM57 until you do have the budgetQUIET SINGERS ACOUSTIC FOLK If you sing softly all of the time you really dont need one of these dynamic mics and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above Of those type I like the Studio Projects C1 Best I think but they are close Shure it gets Five Stars upgrade your SM57 vocal Mic,positive
Im not going to do any explaining about the science behind how this pedal works Im just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone This definitely isnt a boost and its also not an eq the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal To the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone Essentially this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producingThe lo contour knob doesnt increase the amount of bass produced by the amp Rather it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass and low mid tone To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased but it hasnt Youre just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the ampThe process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harshThats not to say that you cant dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something indeed itll make those searing lead tones even betterNow I gave this product 4 stars not because Ive had any issues with it or havent been in any way unsatisfied with it but rather because its really a fairly subtle effect At first I almost couldnt tell a difference between having it on and off With time Ive been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone but it doesnt make a night and day differenceI recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that youre happy with and just want to make it even better This pedal wont make a cheap 15 watt solid state combo sound like a tube halfstack It wont make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it beforeIn conclusion though I definitely wouldnt put this pedal into the must have category it definitely improves the quality of my tone This is a pedal that I leave on all the time as it improves both clean and distorted tones Id call it more of a tone maximizer,positive
DArrario does sell some fine strings While these are not my very very favorites strictly because I prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings they still do just finemuch better than some other brands Ive tried I would not hesitate to buy them again Goodsounding and playing allaround strings Very Good AllAround Strings,positive
The Martin MSP4200 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings Medium are very good strings that are just below strings like Elixers except they are much much less expensive Martin MSP4200 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings Medium,positive
It works fine for the regular guitars but the bass guitar has these very wide tuning pegs This winder has a slot that will sorta fit across this tuning peg but it doesnt feel like it has enough of a grip to make turning it easierI havent had a chance to actually use it while changing strings yet but so far it looks like itll work as advertised in every other aspect It doesnt fit my Bass Guitar as well as I had hoped,positive
I bought five of these when they were being blown out for like 3 apiece but even at the normal price they are a bargain They are comfortable when used for an extended period of time even with a heavy Les Paul If you play an SG these will help counter the dreaded neck dive that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars Incidentally Amazon is selling these straps at about 13 the price you would pay at GC Highly recommended Great value for a decent strap,positive
It really has everything that one could ask for in a guitar capo its a quality wellmade tool that isnt going to fall apart any time soon it has a strong spring so it grips the neck and strings quite solidly and its easy to open up and clamp on the neckCant really say anything more than that this really is a wellmade capo that works just exactly and precisely as a capo is supposed to workI love it Works perfectly solidly made and strong grip,positive
I purchased one of these about 6 months ago for my partner who is a musician because we had no recording equipment in the house We didnt really expect much except a quick way to record ideasIts simple easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound Weve used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity Weve recorded whole ensemble practice sessions with the mic which its really not designed for and still had reasonable results Our friends who are musicians and even an audio engineer are quite surprised and impressed with the quality of sound we getIve even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skypeTo sum it up this mic is cheap easy to use portable and with fidelity that will surprise you but dont expect it to be a full home recording studio Perfect for what it is,positive
this is a great value i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series it fits perfectly thank you great case,positive
These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well As other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as its not abused I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effectsI have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay I dont know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves its purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the futureI have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some EQ tinkering I found a good mix of echo I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D4 and thought it would be a good idea Again Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was 100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp Vintage sound without vintage pedal pricing,positive
As cheap as these strings were I am pleasantly surprised with the results achievedI picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work It had been dropped on its headAfter repairing and playing it it still sounded like crap so I had these strings they were cheap and I put them on Only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effortOkay the guitar and I am too embarrassed to give the brand isnt my Gibson Les Paul or my Fender American Strat but damn it sounds good now If I didnt have so many guitars I might keep this one but I will probably sell it to make room for anotherThese were well worth the few dollars I spent on them Honestly I wont restring my Fender with them Ill use the Fender 250 bullets But these are great for about any electric With guitars crappy strings kill it Great strings can make a bad guitar okay not greatI will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars Just strung an old cheap guitar and brought to life,positive
Only used it a couple times so far but I like it I like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar As someone else mentioned its hard to get the cloth back into the clear plastic bag inside the lid though But otherwise I think its great I like how it smells does that make me strange Good stuff,positive
At lt20 this is a great bargain but it is a very basic bag It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying These are also easily removed if they bother you This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories holds a strap patch cord but not much else and features nice looking graphics More for Les,positive
Okay I used to tune my guitar online However adding a 10 for this item is worth it It is so accurate and works great so far I saw that some people complaint that the tuner comes without a battery but mine come with one Probably it is because I bought it from amazon lt not from some sort of seller in amazon Moreover theres also a warranty for this item For those who want to start playing a guitar like me I strongly recommend to get this tuner You wont regretOwyea The right tool for beginner,positive
These strings are as advertised Nice tone and good quality Cant remember the last time Ive found a bad string from a set of these Actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar Got the high tension ones for a shorter scale instrument so they wouldnt be too sloppy at concert pitch Excellent strings great quality and tone,positive
I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it Upon close inspection the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe 02534 wall so dont expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off even if it is welded better than mine was Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs it is literally that thin of metal tubingFor 1011 I did not expect perfection so to its credit it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitarsThis stand does have one other good quality it is CHEAP Since it was less that 11 I cannot see going through the hassle of returning it I was able to carefully weld mine back together but this would probably not be an option for most The stand might work fine if you dont fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up but If you need portability and durability I would definitely purchase a better quality stand Cheaply made and not very durable,negative
This mic stand is a great value This stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed I bought a few years back and its still working amazing till this day If youre purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands Just make sure that your mic comes with a shock mount because the stand tends to move a little but other than that its a great buy It gets the job done,positive
I needed a cheap good quality mic and this fit the bill Bighter than the SM58 it mimics which is fine for me because my speakers stink I bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality There is no onoff switch so expect that youll shut it off at the mixer Amazing for the price,positive
This with my Behringer XM8500 is perfectI like that it is branded with the planet waves logo on the connectors rather than plain XLR cables Which adds a sense of a quality look my gear This goes directly into my Focusrite 2i2 interface and Im planning on using this same cable with a condenser microphone I have yet to purchase Perfect For live Performance with Dynamic microphone,positive
Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board this was a logical choice of power The single transformer running into the board with the multiplug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak Further with the transformer being well away from the board there is zero AC hum Whats not to like here Perfect source of power,positive
Used these while putting together my personal BluesClassic Rock Frankenstrat Replaced everything but the body Needed these accessories to match a brand new Fender pick guard They worked fine at a great price Original Fender,positive

Was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my 1 year slept Before I was plugging in headphones to my amp head but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up take out electric plug covers get all cords out of the cabinets etc Oh how life changes with a baby This little product is the perfect solutionIt takes two AAA batteries some generic brand are included in the package There are two ON settings regular ON and FX ON Regular on is basically like a standard lead channel Turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean Crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch Nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch FX ON turns on a little delay effect You can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off There are also knobs for volume and tonePlug your headphones into the side and you can also plug in an MP3 player on the top to jam with a backing trackVOX has samples for all of their AMPlugs on their website however they seem to be missing samples for the Joe Satriani version I would say that the JS version is pretty close to the LEAD amplugI have a pair of middlelower range headphones AudioTechnica ATHM30 Professional Studio Monitor Closedback Dynamic Stereo Headphones and the amplug sounds fantasticIn the title I wrote wait for this to go on sale bc of the JS branding this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs However it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled Personally at the higher MSRP i dont think its worth it but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone Very Happy with Purchase wait for this to go on sale,positive
A real money saver a very smart buy It works perfect with my Boss pedals I am very Happy YES YES YES I am glad I bought this,positive
Simply these are great cables They snap right in carry sound well and come with a lifetime warranty The 15 length is just about right and at about one dollar per foot a good value Recommended Great Cables,positive
I had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed This compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack It never sounds 34thumpy34 or unnatural but always musical I really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like This is THE compressor in my opinion,positive
Works well with the AXL PG515 This is good quality for the price Snap is large and holds well but is easy enough to unsnap when needed Its rare to need to remove this strap button because it slides out of the way as needed Acoustic Strap Button,positive
I like Fits well Five Stars,positive
got this to run instruments into my comp to use with sony acid and this works well I had problems with the sony acid latency boo and while I downloaded an asio program to cut the latency I dont use it really now but is good to have when and if I use the sony for recording and not just mixing the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo great device,positive
This thing freaking rocks I LOVE this pedal I cant stop using it Sometimes I just play long drawn out chords so I can listen to this amazing tone in combo with distortion on my amp its perfect metal AMAZING,positive
I AM SELF TAUGHT GUITAR FOR ABOUT 15 MONTHS WITHOUT THIS I WOULD BE LOST I WORK WITH A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED GUITAR FOR 30 YEARS HE TUNES IT TO ITSELF WHEN I HAD HIM TRY MY TUNER HE FOUND THAT HIS GUITAR WAS TUNED TO ITSELF YET SO FAR OFF FOR 15 YOU CANT BEAT THIS DONT BE SO CHEAP BUY THIS AND ENJOY IT BUY THIS,positive
This works exactly as intended and is a perfect size for my MS2000 Not really sure what the going price is on other stands but Im very happy with what I paid for it No worries of my synth falling over or anything like that the only issue I had was with putting it together at first The picture in the instructions was kind of hard to figure out because there are different sized bars that were kind of difficult to interpret But it was probably more of my error and even with that it just meant I had to unscrew them and screw in the right ones Solid stand for a great price,positive
Does what it is supposed to do It is pretty good quality and durable too Quick simple and efficient I would definitely buy again Highly recommended Perfect,positive
I bought this as for practice I have a 180 amp but was looking for something a little more portable This is what I came toIt has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too The lead cuts clean 34mostly34 In general is does tend to get a little noisy though However For the price this is probably one of the best steals ever Like I said I have a 34sortof34 name brand amp that is estimated at around 180 I can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp Until I can afford a REALLY good amp this will be my primary one and really I have no problem with thatProsCheap PriceFair sound qualityNifty Builtin EffectCan plug into AUX letting you play with musicConsCheap ITEM qualityDistortion can get 34messy34Not very versatileMetal ONLYI hope it never breaks AmPlug better than lowbudget amps,positive
This little stand collapses and sets up so easy Holds my guitar perfectly May buy one for my dad next LOVE IT,positive
Works as it should Nice materials and I think it will be durable Simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed It will improve your recordings getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway works great priced right,positive
I actually own an even dozen of these Ive never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars They work great you cant beat the price I think I paid around 495 for most of the ones I purchased Although these are great I will continue to use them as needed eg when playing I just replaced these today with Swing String Wall Hangers I freedup so much of my floor space by moving 12 guitars to the wall that I was actually excited about all the free space Great Inexpensive Functional Stand,positive
Ive had this pedal for a number of years It provides a wide range of reverb effects sounds natural and has a killer stereo output Ive havent heard a pedal that competes with spring reverb but this pedal keeps up with any simulated reverb pedal Ive heard and does an excellent job with amps that lack a spring unit The effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well Recommended Great pedal great price,positive
I enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars Easy to install and remove 5 stars to the seller and the strap itself affordable and well made,positive
Im a beginner Good harps Good solid soundI cant bend at all so no idea if its just meYoutube these theres loads of videos Good sounding inexpensive harps and great case,positive
This amp is a ton of fun The presets sound great by themselves but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the Fender Fuse software It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike Best modeling practice amp for the price,positive
I have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time I have bought 150 pedals and 100 pedals and I got this one for 25 and it blows all the others out of the water The only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the Behringer power supply I couldnt get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my PylePro PPDLP02 DC supply The plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that I love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in Michigan A great Vibrato,positive
if all you want is amplike vibrato and chorus here ya go and its cheap and cool looking bigger footprint than a Boss pedal The Hue control gently affects the tone not bad for the price,neutral
The Boss RC3 Loop Pedal is great for playing guitar in a band or with friends but also a big help practicing It comes with 10 preset rhythm tracks but the real fun is laying down your own chord sequences with your guitar and then being able to play lead guitar over that rhythm loop with just a quick stomp on the pedal It makes practicing etc a lot of fun and meaningful I havent figured out all the possibilities yet and probably never will but it is a cool pedal to have Like all Boss pedals its as sturdy as a little truck Great Guitar Pedal,positive
This is a good quality product as advertised fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument I am satisfied perfect fit,positive
Its an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off Just Ok Not going to use them,neutral
So based on the reviews from Amazon and a friend who swears by these pickups I decided to put one into my 310 TaylorI am extremely pleased This was my brothers guitar and he had a Mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop It sounded terrible I tried messing with placement to get it to sound better but it just didnt sound good had tons of feedback and just didnt have a good feelI installed this pickup myself I have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars and this one was pretty painlessI didnt have to drill out the endpin hole so it only took me about 20 minutes to install this bad boyWhen I tested it out I was blown away It sounded beautiful Just like my Taylor only louderThe true test was an actual live performance I brought my Baggs Para Acoustic DI and I was glad I didI was able to adjust the EQ just a tad cut some of the midrange a bit and it sounded even betterI could not believe it It literally gave me chillsIf youre on the fence about this pickup go for it The reviews dont lie this sounds fantastic especially if you can EQ it a bitI did plug in without the PADI just to test it and it still sounded good If I forgot my PADI I would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system It might be labeled as passive but its got the volume of an active system for sureIts a great buy in my opinion Couldnt Be Happier,positive
These on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well I have had no problems with them Works well,positive
I love these clip on vibration reading tuners This was the second one I tried The first was a Barcus Berry which worked equally well They both have lots of features such as tap tempo up and down tuning adjustments With the Barcus Berry it was the first one after trying the Snark which is a cool name and a lot more colorful I tuned up a brand new guitar in a store out of the box in less than 2 minutes never came close to doing that before That convinced me the Quicktunes I had been using were accurate but these seemed to be better and get you perfect I have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments which makes sense they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electricFrom the literature it seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals that have been raved aboutHello Raving bout this I seen on Amazon they are cheaper I bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for 1999 here they are around 10 to 12 bucks These type of tuners especially the intellitouch are popular wih Bluegrass folk like me The grapics on this are great no more shaky needle just a dead on still reading when you are perfect incredible upgrade from my quicktune,positive
While the sound improvement is not huge with my guitar it didnt need to be When it comes to music it is34 that little extra34 that makes the difference The Planet Waves OPorts gives me that extra I have no doubt it will continue to please me for manymany years to come Sound Enhancement,positive
This is the first guitar pick I ever played with and to this day is my favorite type Nice and thin and flexible but not so flexible that you cant bend it for single picking Im torn between this style out of nostalgia and the blue versionbecause I love blue My favorite picks,positive
love the case nice and simple it really look exactly the same as the picture highly recommend to everyone looking for a case awesome,positive
Up until a few years ago I had been using the same old brand Id been buying for 20 years Then I tried this recipe Dunlop 65 It is wonderful It does everything the product description tells you about Excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal I use it to clean not only the body but the tuning heads and bridge on my bass guitar No nasty residue build up over time It cleans and polishes just like it was designed to do without streaking and so on Youll like this stuff better than anything youve used to dateor at least I think so I sure do Youll be glad to use this on your instrument,positive
I had just purchased a Polytune about 6 months to 1 year ago and was a little annoyed when I saw ads for the Polytune 2 Mine was still brand new to me and worked really well But after reading and watching about the improvements in this update I decided to take the hit sell mine for a loss of 20 and get the new one A GREAT choice This Polytune 2 is amazing bright accurate strobe option well builtdid I say brightimproved foot switch Its just another example of TC hitting it out of the park yet again Highly recommend getting one of these you know unless you want to grab a 1st gen for a deal TC does itagain,positive
These are great strings I thought the bullet end was BS hype but I really think it makes the string stronger and the sound clearer And even if that is my rusty ears lying to me I can say with conviction that they definitely fit better with my GL Legacy guitars regular strings had the little extra wind from the ball end coming right up to the saddle in some cases these solve that problem Coooool,positive
I do all my own guitar maintenance which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings etc I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench So looking around on Amazon I found this handy little device Its small works well and fairly inexpensive My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the allplastic construction But dont get me wrong its still pretty strong just dont put too much weight on it while using it Another great Planet Waves idea,positive
A year ago I wrote a lengthy comparison of theEdirol R09 WAVEMP3 Recorder Blackand theZoom H4 Handy Recorder 2GB Accessory Kitpreaccessory kit I wanted a high quality easy to use recorder so even though the H4 had all of the features of the Edirol and sold for considerably less I kept the Edirol because it was so much easier to useZoom has responded with the H2 a scaled down version of the H4 with all of the features of the R09 and all of the controls right where you need them The H2 even has additional features over the R09 but they dont get in the way For example theres a choice of a 90 degree recording pattern a 120 degree recording pattern and even a surround sound option Samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its websiteOne big complaint Ive had with the Edirol is the cost of its addon stand Unlike the Edirol the H2 comes with a simple stand In addition the H2 has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod On a separate note its much easier to replace batteries with the H2 than the EdirolRecently I got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the Edirol R09 and the Zoom H2 I used Adobe Audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness The first time we played them back I thought I detected a VERY slight preference for the Edirol with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units The second time we played them back my preference was for the H2 with overall opinion continuing to be split We all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at allI do prefer the Edirols control buttons to the H2s membrane and Im not about to sell the Edirol perhaps because I am more familiar with the Edirol and dont want to give it up just yet Also the Edirol R09 is the darling of the moment However if I owned neither I couldnt justify the huge bump in price of the Edirol over the H2 and would opt for the H2 When I went to a music party last weekend and knew Id need only one recorder I grabbed the H2 As good as the Edirol R09 for about half the price,positive
Looks great feels great and works great The leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely great I love it Look,positive
Ive probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life and find that Planet Waves makes a good one at a fair price Picks will always be a subjective thing every user has hisher own preference so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end These are well made last quite awhile and they dont even look bad try them out you might just like them Nice quality picks,positive
So many tones to choose from with the variable frequency Eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal Lots of flavors,positive
I bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after 2 uses the wood looks great again I used the honey twice in 2 days and brought back the maple wood to like new conditionThis honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier I saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after I bought this but I do not use it much so it should last a long time Does the job well,positive
This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries Weve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it We are using an mp3 player for backup The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm30 so only 4 stars from me The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and its nice not to have to load up cart to roll around Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features Plenty of power,positive
I love this tuner It measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone I find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord I want to play next I can sing the note into it and then I know which chord I want to play next Great Tuner,positive
I really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar The rubber makes it easy to hold onto and I feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well Good for Acoustic nylon string,positive
This mixer is awesome I couldnt get it where I live so I bought it on Amazon it works great I plugged my Shure mic and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In and also my ipod to the 2track and everything works great Great sound with the right parameters you just have to adjust a little here and there and it will work great so far no buzz or humm Awesome mixer,positive
I bought it for my violin I was a bit reluctant because I uses vibrations to tune and I was hoping not to get something useless Its been great so far Its easy to use I clip it on my violin and tune I like to keep it on while I play to make sure I have my fingers in the correct spot as it shows the note Im playing Great Tunner,positive
If you want a strap for 5 you cant expect the moon I bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price This is simple I would not want to use it with a tank top on or for guys on skin because it is stiff and not comfy but it is practical and works well The leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps Both ends are the same leather one of my straps has a string on the end this kind does not it is made for the snapsNo bells or whistles but I would recommend it for the price A nice strap for a really nice price,positive
Nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it happy buyer Thank you very much Fender Treated Polish Cloth,positive
I only use Dunlops For a number of reasons First the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to Second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to Thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions Two thumbs up I only use Dunlops,positive
Good bottom the stainless gives you a nice trebletheres still a good flatwound sound i use roundwound on my other basses but it was nice to come back Smooth,positive
This is a very simple product but one which fulfills its intended purpose of hanging guitars on the wall This fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths The swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck Holds all my guitars on the wall,positive
Its a great little tuner great accuracy but unfortunately they are a bit on the delicate side The first one started working about a week after i bought it Just broke down The second one i purchased had a break when it arrived After piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner But bewarethese are manufactured on the cheap Tuner works great but beware of dependability,neutral
This is a high quality microphone Sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent Works great with my new mixer Built very sturdy with metal and not plastic Shipping was great along with packaging This is a very nice dynamic mic Mic Check,positive
I typically play DAddario 010s but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these Well I gotta say Im not stricken with disbelief at these but they are very nice Overall I would say that they feel about the same as my DAddario strings but if the price is right I wouldnt mind a substitution every now and again They DO bend very nicely obviously your guitars scale length and your ability to bend strings may vary Nice and Slinky,positive
I did purchase 3 diferent slides this one is mark as a medium but is diferent size from the other ones what I ordered Perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size This is why I give only 3 stars because is to small for me Look nice but is way to small for me,neutral

Despite being so small it will fill most rooms Completely These are lasers You can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver The patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace I havent tested the soundfeature but Ive seen it on videos I recommend this to anyone want to be entertained Looks Great Worth the price,positive
If youre like me you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PCIt works fine for the handy type recordersBut forget hooking this directly to a PC Way too much noise Good for some uses,positive
Excellent Mothers Little Helper Highly recommend this item It a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument A Must Glaesel Ultra ViolinViola Practice Mute,positive
These strings are really quite good but I wouldnt call them perfect The unwound strings are not quite as bright as I am accustomed to but they still ring nicely This is the only complaint I have about these strings If the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be 5star strings As it stands I give them 45 stars not a big knock actuallyThe lowend on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm I put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the 34jumbo34 aspect of my acoustic The sound is very big full and niceDefinitely a recommended product455 stars These strings are really quite good but I wouldnt call them perfect,positive

Donr be fooled by the imitations should be their slogan There are some real junky ones out there and these are great love the washers life savers Thanks Best rack screws for your money,positive
its hard to keep the loose end under the holes and since the holes are metal they can scratch the neck of the instrument otherwise its a good idea could be better,neutral
If your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise interference I installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music no more hum noise crackling etc overall this was an excellent buy silence the annoying hum,positive
These are my goto acoustic strings They are a quality string with great sustain and clarity I bought Elixir Nanos to compare and I did like them but I think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these Ill be sticking with these for the long run Great strings,positive
We opted for the World Tour Guitar Gig Bag over a hard case because most of the time my sons guitar is hanging on the wall usingString Swing Hardwood Home Studio Guitar Hanger Shades May Vary This case is generally good quality and meets our needs with the following observationsPros Lightweight doesnt add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar Good Quality strong material stitching and zippers Storage Pockets big enough for music pages picks and a small electronic tuner Handles good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapsCons Limited Protection this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact Appearance this is not aweinspiring to look at being very basic and the World Tour logo looks a little cheesyThis was a good choice for the limited light use it gets from usRecommendedCFH Roomy Guitar Case Recommended,positive
Let me start of by saying this tuner is greatMy previous tuner was a Korg CA40 and frankly that tuner is terribleThe main differences between SAT800 and the CA40SAT800 has a buildin light CA40 does notCA40 has a buildin stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle SAT800 does notSAT800 has a auto and manual mode CA40 has autoSAT800 displays the octave of the note eg 1E 2E etc CA40 displays only displays the alphabet E for all oactavesSAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off CA40 does notWhat made me get a new tuner is how finicky the CA40 when using the buildin mic The needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner Yes it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability Another issue with the CA40 is the poor screen The screen is so dark and only viewable head onThe CA40 does not have any of the flaws of the CA40 and is even more accurateWhat this tuner has accuracy usability durability versatility What more can you ask from a tuner of this price Miles better than the Korg CA40,positive
These do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings I like them Good Strings,positive
This is a terrific product While the price might seem a little high for a power adapter it actually serves the function of what you might need several other adapters and daisy chains to accomplishThe key to the OneSpot is the 1700mA output By comparison the Boss PSA120 adapter puts out 200mA Since most stompboxes draw between 5 and 60 mA of power you could only reliably chain up to about 3 or 4 of them with the BOSS adapterThe combo kit is a great value because it comes with a daisy chain for up to eight pedals and some other parts for hookups to a 9V adapter or other jacks that I dont use on my pedals I use it with BOSS and Ibanez pedals and it works great Best of all theres no added electric buzzing noise which is a problem with many budget power solutionsAlso like how the cable hookups are angled instead of straight makes much more sense for a tight pedalboard No more 9Vs and no more hooking up multiple cables every time one simple plug and Im ready to play Terrific adapter solution for mediumtolarge pedalboards,positive
If you own more than 1 pedal and we all do you need this and the 1 spot adapter It will save you a lot of money on batteries and aggravation when you battery runs out on stage Its worth its weight in gold and RockIsland Sound sends it out FAST You can count on me for future purchases Thanks Guys perfect,positive
I quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something I would use but as I said Its ok its ok,neutral
After researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever I chose the Fulltone OCD The reviews on Amazon helped as well along with Youtube demos and guitar mags What finally made my choice for me was when I found out that Robin Trower used one for his last 2 US tours befor Fulltone made him a sig modelOkay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive The HPLP switch alone gives you a very distinct tone for solos or rhythm and tweaking the dials adds to the fun Im constantly playing with the tones a minor adjustment makes a huge difference The coolest thing is that this pedal is responsive to your playing dynamics picking softly dials down the OD then you can just unleash the crunch with harder attacksmuch better than trying to rolloff the volume The truebypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged As of now this is my favorite piece of gearIf youre looking for massive distortion keep looking But this will be my go to bluesrock pedal for quite some time OCD indeed,positive
I have a rosegold plated flute and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating This does the job perfectly Wipes off fingerprints smudges easily and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate Is easy on the plating and very gentle Washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries Am very pleased Great for my flute,positive

This is super warm and can get very trippy I like the depth it adds to everything from subtle extreme and whatever else the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too nice extra 600 milliseconds really is more than enough and I have a highend tape type unit that is something like 25 seconds but for what this does more than enough I like retro and this is it I used this on a show the day I got it and it was noticed by all I have to say MXR has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal Again do your Youtube homework and listen around and youll come to your conclusion Amazon is great to deal with Very cool unit better than I expected,positive
This would be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you want a lot of reverb What the hell was Behringer thinking faded attack semi worhless,negative
I usually play classical nylon string guitar but have an Ovation deepbowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out I never have found strings that I really liked dont ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory One of those duh things I didnt even think of until just nowBased on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon I purchased this tripleset of strings Instant gratification First they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days but these retained tune fairly well The sound is excellent the playability comfy The tone of my Ovation was backHere are my itemized observations First three sets for 13 currently Cannot beat the value for price BRILLIANCE What many people call 34bright34 brilliance is the opposite of 34dull34 Some strings sound dull right out of the package These strings are brilliant bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar TONE The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through no hint of 34tinniness34 34plunk34 or 34twang34 MELLOW Mellow is difficult to define but the best definition Ive heard is 34Ah that sounds nice34 Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar Its a pleasantness that doesnt grate on your ears when you pluck a string These strings are mediummellow just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep BALANCE At first the E overtoned the b and e But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass COMFORT The 1253mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action These strings are just right especially the 53mm E which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strummingSUMMARY These are excellent strings which doesnt surprise me since Ive use DAddario classical guitar strings for years Martin and GHS are both good strings but somehow DAddario just shinesThanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try Highly recommended Highly recommended Very good strings,positive
Awesome little untreated polishing cloth I have purchased these for all of my guitars more than I care to admit and they are fantastic They clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced Awesome product to keep your axe looking great Cleans Great,positive
Im so glad Ernie Ball decided to put out this tool Ive been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill The reason I never did was that I was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose This is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners I love it Its about time,positive
I use the US600 for short lead riffs it works great in a sweetening role It is easy to change the key manually in point of fact much easier than I originally thought Its a mainstay on my pedal board now Harmony on a budget was never sweeter,positive

No complaints its quiet enough and the price is right Is it a Monster cable No but it doesnt cost as much either Ive used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine Decent XLR cable,positive
I purchased this key on a whim When it arrived the instructions were not clear but I sat the dial to 2 loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning Too loose and deep so I increased the setting to 3 and repeated Almost the sound I wanted so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern Perfect I then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest Using the 3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 12 octave apartNext I worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side I used 4 on the batter side and 5 on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound I wanted The bass drum came next I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attainedThis is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting Test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned setIll never go back to tuning by ear Youll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and dont forget to write down your optimum settings This actually works and works well,positive

I replaced the factory strings on myDean Playmate Avalanche Junior Solid Body Electric Guitar Metallic Silver 34 Sizeand what a difference in sound These strings seriously rock I also use DAddario strings on my ukulele and Ive had great luck with those They withstand a lot of play and I dont have to replace them often The best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder Definitely recommended The sweet sound of music,positive

Well the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morningAm I impressed U bet chaThis thing is simply beautiful It arrived well padded in a double box Initially I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws NONE Not a finger print on it anywhere This guitar is extremely well made and put together right It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter The neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities I put a quarter under the 10th fret and its right on the 34money34Its considerably heaver than than I thought I would imagine it weighs about 1014lbs I have a strap ordered and on the wayThe maple top is a work of art with a superior finish All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had Your hand floats over the fretsI dont think you could get a better piece for the price point Epiphone LP100 Les Paul Electric Guitar Vintage Sunburst,positive

Not the best quality in the world but for the price tag is wasnt half bad If youre doing something more professional it may wear out overtime but if its just for personal use you should be fine with this product Good microphone stand,positive
Hi Folks OK this thing is cheap Thats cool But a cheap item you cant use is money thrown away Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying its too small Well I want to clear this up once and for all IT IS TOO SMALL Specifically it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so depending on your guitar AND it doesnt open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret even on a skinny neck This thing really is a puzzler I mean who the hell would make capos this size especially when they couldve made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid HOWEVER a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele and for way cheap ha ha But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size this is utter garbage Cheers Ignore the tempting price TOO SMALL for any guitar,negative
This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on its sideNeedless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul Good for Fender Stratocaster not good for Les Paul,positive
Im going to be honest I have a cheap guitar I payed 120 for an Epiphone at my local music store because I just play it recreationally Bonfires sitting around the house etc So Ive never really put a nice set of strings on it because I figured strings arent really going to make THAT much of a sound difference on this guitar but I was way way way wrong These strings arent even that expensive actually theyre only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings I put on my guitar Yet they completely changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like I forked over some money for a decent guitar The strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips I used to play once or twice a week but I cant help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing Perfect,positive
I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks The product description didnt mention that but I was pleased to receive more than threeMy son told me he needed some new picks and since lately hes been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks hes been playing with for three years After hearing him play with these picks Ive noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks I wish we could choose the color or maybe they could send a color assortment Well be buying these for a long time to come Wow Im amazed at the difference these make,positive
Ive purchased other types but I keep coming back to this one For the its the best buy in my opinion Sturdy and flexible not too heavy,positive
As you can tell by the title Ive got another of these little babies Snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great Better than the first one,positive
If you are prone to losing your guitar picks this is a good set of 10 picks to have around all in your choice of a single color per pack The quality is a bit better than the cheap fishbowl picks at the music store but not as good as my favorite picksDunlop Big Stubby Picks 20mm Good disposable picks,positive
These were just what I needed Over the years some of the bridge pins on my 12Sttring Acoustic Guitar have broken and had to be replaced Some of them had the white dot some didnt therefore they didnt look uniform With these pins the guitar now looks like it did when I bought it Thank You James EdwardBATOwens Bridge Pins,positive
i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around This makes a good spare but I would not use it and trust it on stage It is thin leather and doesnt seem like it will hold up under any abusive situation Thats just my opinion of it you may not see it like that and have no fear of it I would fear it white guitar strap,neutral
Holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar Holds my picks but if i move it to another,positive
Instead of shelling out over 2500 for a Line 6 AC adapter for my Pocket POD I decided to give this one a try out and Im glad I did Its well made works great and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process Cant beat this one for sure Cheapest adapter for my Line 6 POD,positive
Love the ukulele and the book is okay shows cords but the songs are very outdated you tube is your friend when learning the ukuUpdate I got a tenor uku for Xmas adn bought a concert uku just because I love them both more than this little guy although it does travel with me and I just forked out money for a hardshell case so it wont get beat up as much in my suitcase by American Airlines just ruined my suitcaseanyhow it has been going out of tune for awhile now c string fattest one and I just figured out my bridge is lifting there are two rivets holding it down and there is a board inside although not a very thick onewill be putting a new piece on the inside and some good wood glue under the bridge and let it dry if the bridge falls apart again I will be smashing the box and making a Banjo uku with the neckif you think you are really going to like playing go for a concert or tenor if you are liking the size spend a bit of money this is pretty much the same as my grand daughters 20 dollar ebay ukulele I bought myself 4 years ago and gave to my 3 yo grand daughter because that one too would not stay in tune great starter,positive
This is the most awesome loop pedal ever does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered Best Loop Pedal,positive
Good price and sound Classic behringer plastic housing I havent had a problem with ever but I dont dog my stuff Favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt thats flexible Fair to say real tube is the best but for analog and practice amps this does put some life in the tone Cant say for metal as Im not so into but everything else find this fits the bill Fix that analog junk distortion,positive
What else can be said that isnt implied in the title of this review Not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who dont want to purchase the items separately My only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was 5 years ago That and the fact they didnt play more songs but who can blame them their catalog is almost endless one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality Not a single second wasted,positive
All adjustments keep position well About as sturdy as a tripod can be Exactly as advertised no complaints from this user Works great,positive
I have one of these in every one of my cases Its a plastic sponge holder with holes in it nothing special but it does the job Planet Waves Acoustic Guitar Humidifier,positive
just used mine for the first time today love it it is every thing behringer said it was does every thing i need it to do for my two piece blue grass show this mixer kicks butt,positive
I can bear it and dig it cause fuzzy wuzzy was a bear and it is green like the frog dig it I must have gotten a really good one cause mine sounds great and is nothing like those on You Tube that sound so bad the only bad in mine is that what comes before behind and it is bad 55 Fuzzy Wuzzy and I can bear the bad 55 that it is,positive
Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better Either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point These strings make my cheap ukulele sound notsocheap and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldnt let me down when I decided to play the ukulele I was correct ,positive
beyond stoked bought so i could teach my son bassi cant believe how much sound comes out of this box ampeg will always build my bass rigs however big or small small box big sound,positive
I ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer I am very happy with how it performs in both situations High quality solid support and good design decisions all around The angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computerThe arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to I will try to add pictures when I get a chanceThis is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base I am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a 34Gibraltar MultiMount Microphone Clamp34 Major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexibleNote the music stand easily detaches from the adjustableangle part for storage This is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of 34locking34 so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off This could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuationsFinal verdict I own two and am considering buying one of the fullwidth MUSARM 2 models also Fabulous,positive
Although I never gigged with it I think this would be great for any musician who gigs with a 2x12 or a 2x10 combo amp I used this with various fender and line 6 amps and it worked great for amplifying the sound Would buy again if given the circumstance Worked great,positive
Its amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electroacoustic guitar Its very useful when you dont want to carry two o three guitars or when you cant buy an acoustic one Its the best I love this pedal,positive
For the money there isnt a better tuner on the market today This is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really This tuner is spot on every time and super fast You can move from string to string quick The Best Tuner,positive
I am a longtime musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments wanted to like this but First the positives Looks great nice easy to read display the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs the clip seems sturdy tuner is compact nice priceNow the significant disappointment inaccurateThe settings were on A440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing the tuning was sharp I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners very disappointing I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price however since DAddario now owns Planet Waves products they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner it has its place I guess but I much prefer the larger one too bad they made this decision IMO I havent settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models Bottom line no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately not only string to string but to a standard A440 having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation Inconsistent Accuracy,negative
Genuine fender pick guard Its preshielded Perfect for your next build or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart Genuine fender,positive
I use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone It is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place Works Just Fine,positive
I actually have five of these for the various instruments mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solidbody electricWhen mounted properly to studs the only way I have mounted these they are very very solid While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete and to me a brass screw looks great with this 34flat black34 modelThe CC11 model this one works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic There are variants for other instruments but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit The yoke width is adjustable and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holderRecommendedbut do consider you means of mounting carefully Quality guitar hangers for display rehearsal room etc,positive
Very nice product and fits well and good quality Its held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone Daughter approved,positive
I really like this delay Its simple and works well I really am starting to love Behringer Great pedal for a great price Great delay pedal,positive
Its actually sleek looking and although I didnt have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar its a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and Im sure Ill lose a lot less picks because of it Its almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thingis that weird to say Just buy it already Get it,positive
I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product A workaround for the main issue follows the review The flaws that bother me in order of significance are1 Quality Very weak softmetal screws Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screwheads on all 4 that I worked with 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws2 Engineering The instructions recommend and the screws the ones that come with the straplocks are designed for a 2 Phillips screwdriver However a standard 2 driver is too big to fit into the strapbuttons So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit or using a 1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job3 Engineering The point of connection for the strap is 58th of an inch out from the guitar The strap button has a radius about 316ths of an inch Therefore any lateral stress ie weight of the guitar is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higherRealistically if the screws werent total crap this might have been a 3 or 4 star review Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wont fit and get the things properly installed it would probably work out for most people So if you are stuck with a set heres what I recommendGo to a hardware store and buy 6 x 1 ovalhead stainless steel replacement screws Note that these wont fit properly but they are the closest match and can be modified They are 21 cents each at my local stores and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with thisPut the screw into an electric drill pointy end in so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head It doesnt need much I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each While you are at it file down a cheap 2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap buttonInstall with the new screws as normal and recommend that your friends try a different brand Disappointing Quality and Engineering,negative
Much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning I cant recommend this enough and the battery last a LONG time I havent had to change mine in almost two years since Ive had it Just a great overall tuner Great Tuner,positive
Great tuner for the priceMakes tunning easy and fastThe grips come off the neck on my acousticbut works better on my electric Does the job,positive
If you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal I had a boss ds 1 and metal zone mt 2 and did not like them much because theyre so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on Marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what youre looking for then this is for you it offers rugged construction and true bypass the only problem I have had is that unity gain is at around 9 o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone ooh it sounds gooood,positive
I love this company Daddario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time Ever since I switched to this brand of strings they seem to last longer and make a grab tone I dont know if its my guitar Taylor 214CE or the strings but I can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use I definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar Recommended by my local music shop as well,positive
I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments These straps are quite flexible lengthwise so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldnt get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position you will not be disappointed here These are also a nice medium width so they should be suitable for all kinds of players Although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons I actually find the snug fit to be an advantage it doesnt feel like Ill have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar And the price is right Great Value,positive
GLS Audio 25ft Mic Cable is very High Quality You will not be disappointed Low cost long lasting Im very satisfied GLS Audio 25ft Mic Cable,positive
I bought a pedal board and needed power and wires Bought this kit It is just super The One Spot provides the power needed the wiring is just right for the pedals Ive installed This is a great setall youll need to get your pedal train wired and running Best at filling the need for effect pedal hook up,positive
So glad I found these three sides much easier for me to hold thin is in As a beginner these make much more comfortable These are the picks you are looking for look no further,positive
These feel very good but they wear off quite quickly so not pick taping and easy with the struming Also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical Not as durable,neutral
I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out but honestly this thing is worth every penny It cuts your changing time down drastically You dont really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller winder and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool Not to mention its very rigid and it certainly seems like itll hold up for years to come Consider it,positive
A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord LOL The cord delivers good sound quality The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy Good Cord,positive
This string set offers typical DAddario quality and value I use DAddario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle Good beginner set,positive
This capo works very wellIt applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design The rubber seems to hold well its a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time but Ive had no issues as of yetMy guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capos design I also have a quickchange Keyser and I can say I prefer this one for practice sessions but the Keyser for performing This one is too slow for the stage Wonderful Capo,positive
I have an Epiphone es339 and recently put these strings on itOh man do they sound nice Its like I got a whole new guitar once I threw these onStill sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendySlinkkkkkkyyyy D My goto strings for my electric guitar,positive
Use this to record my guitar on Garage Band Works and sounds really good I would recommend it Great value Great,positive
Yea how could a music stand be amazing Well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent It actually hold by 500 song fake book you know the one that weighs about 10 pounds It stays where you set it and works wonderfully NO complaints Amazing,positive
Ive just got the Shure SM58 microphoneAs expected this is a real workhorse of microphones the sound is clear crispy robust high quality productAlso Ive bought it at Amazon and they sold through JR Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier They shipped in less time than expectedIm a really happy customer now Great product great supplier,positive
Cool little digital tuner that works great on my ukulele Small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners I like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance Highly recommended Works great on my ukulele,positive
I bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on She absolutely loves it Everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it You cant beat this for the price This guitar is beautiful,positive
Thought I would give this pedal a shot since it was inexpensive and sounded really good in the online videos posted for it Pros Very good sound quality many options for echo to suit every individual taste bright blue flashing red for tap tempo LEDs stereo dual outin operation tape analog digital types of delay awesome guitar signal smooths out when engaged and class A bypass Cons Volume decrease by a hair when you engage the pedal signal becomes a little bassier but it sounds good with the analog echoes batteries go FAST get the adapterAll in all it was worth the money Comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it A lot of options available with this goodsounding pedal Great Sounds for the,positive
These are pretty standard dynamic mics and for what you pay the quality is good I use them as room mics mainly for which they perform admirably Ive only used them once for backup vocals and the results were good Would recommend these for folks on a budget Also the case is nice Not too shabby,positive
Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P90sDAddario promises these strings to be comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations that result in greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between stringsI dunno anything regarding the science behind this but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of DAddario 10s they offer Its not a huge huge difference but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performanceFor one thing theyre pretty stiff They bend but not easily Maybe thats what they mean by Balanced tension Theyre also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s Not flatwound mellow by any means but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s I do get a great rock tone out of them mind you but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound Personally I like the tone I get out of them theyre big and warm without being dull sounding but again your preferences might differOne thing thats GREAT about these strings is once theyre properly stretched they stay in tune FOREVER Again maybe this is part of the balanced tension and if so good job DAddarioI havent had them on forever to really see how long they last but theyve been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day oneWho would these appeal to Well if you like really light strings that bend easily youre not going to like these If youre a rythm player who does long gigs the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you Good but unique,positive
This pedalboard is very solid durable and easy to pack in their soft case which I love especially because it makes my pedalboard and some extras much easier to carry to and from gigs There is space below the pedalboard for cables to run and the velco and glue they provide to keep the pedals on the board are very reliable The MINI is the perfect size for me but overall Ive been very pleased with Pedaltrain in general Pedaltrain makes a great Pedalboard,positive
I do not have much to say about this It does what it was designed to do and it looks fineI found myself actually trying to see if it will rip for the purposes of this review Just so I could make some sort of comment about it You can rip it if you try but its not likely to happen during everyday useIts fairly thick If that isnt what you want then I would look elsewhere This should be fine for nearly everyone who doesnt have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen Works,positive
These cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp Not too long not too short Just what I needed Perfect for my needs,positive
I bought this unit because my amp doesnt have reverb But I discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds Even when I use a reverbed amp I turn it off and use my Hall of Fame Sounds amazing,positive
These strings are great sounding and great looking on the fretboard because they are bronze One issue I had was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head but it still wound up very nicely I would actually say that you might want to get the Extra Light gauge but its probably just my tuning machines they kind of suck Buy these They are really good,positive
This mixer has four mic inputs It has some fun effects This mixer comes with a 80Hz filter and a 3band equalizer on the mic channels It has a FXsend that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono I do not hear any external noise It has a durable metalic case This mixer has great audio This product ships as expected,positive
I always go with Elixirs Great longlasting sound I would recommend these to anyone both experienced players and amateurs alike The best,positive
I bought this to replace an actual fullout PA and was VERY pleasantly surprisedPros GREAT price VERY loud as well as clear Also compact and very durableCons NoneBottom Line As a monitor look no further I use it as a PA for practicing and it is a Godsend Buy now GREAT buy for the size and price,positive
I usually play an 11 on top and first grabbed my digital caliper to confirm the gauge of the high E in this set 8211 it felt heavier than a 10 but the LED doesn8217t lie and it confirmed 10I put the NYXL set on my Ibanez Artist with DiMarzio humbuckers I stretch new strings out of habit I don8217t like the constant slipping as they settle I stretch all six strings in about 45 segments up the neck retune and hope for the bestThere8217s no whammy bar on the Artist and for the first few days I did a lot of blues bending to see how they8217d hold up the NYXLs stayed in tune very solidly with only minor tweaking as to be expected with any stringsI chose a darkersounding guitar than a singlecoil Fender hoping the supposed brightness of the NYXLs would be more noticeable On this guitar I usually play D8217Addario XLs and an Ernie Ball 8216pink8217 set on my Strat so I8217ve got two points of referenceIn terms of tone from the start the NYXLs sound much closer to 8216broken in8217 than the Ernie Balls There8217s far less 8216new jangle8217 to them and while they8217re bright they8217re manageable for the kind of tone I8217m after I play jazz in a more contemporary vein 8211 in terms of tone more Scofield and Abercrombie than Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall I like a rich tone with some high end but without too much 8216klang8217In terms of feel and tension the NYXLs are stiffer and closer to the regular XLs than to Slinkys which is probably to be expected But oddly the windings of the low EAD remind me a bit more of the Ernie Balls than XLs whose windings feel a bit widerThree weeks on with the onset of warm humid weather around here the strings are showing no rust and still sound freshWith so many players going through modeled amps and effects it8217s a fair question just how much the tonal quality of electric strings still matters 8211 or are we headed for 8216virtual strings8217 designed mostly for durability and intonation Will we be dialing in 8216new and klangy8217 8216broken in with worn windings or 8216sweated through and rusty8217I like to believe there are enough players out there young and old still fussy about tone and the role a good set of strings plays in delivering it To them I8217d say these are worth checking out A Nice Upgrade of D8217Addario8217s workhorse XLs,positive
Im new to the guitar and Im just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best for me with different guitars and different effects I like these for my acoustic Ibanez dreadnaught The pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the Daddario strings They are comfortable and I like the feel in my hand The mediums suit me Maybe it is all personal taste but I think they are worth buying Amazon pricing is great The picks feel great and Im having a good time Pick pick pick,positive
Im an true analog guy But when I grabbed this pedal I was blown away This little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size A lot of which do not sound to digital I was amazed at the tones I could pull out of it For 99 it is a steal I would pay twice that for what this pedal does Easy to navigate and understand Small enough to fit on any pedalboard Easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches If youre looking for a multi effects stomp box look no farther than the Zoom MS50G Well worth the 9900 Can easily set it up for live situations Of course youre not gonna get all the effects at a drop of a dime But I set mine up for a few effects I use live Works flawless When in the studio this is where the pedal shines Also it cant be beat for when youre just jamming alone at home If youre are gigging of course this isnt going to be your go to pedal but it does come in handy for some really nice effects The review before mine well they should of known this pedal isnt the greatest for live venues Thats why we have pedalboards with all our different effects we can call up with the drop of a foot I was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so Went to a local music store heard and was sold No one can touch Amazons price and service Get off the fence and buy this pedal I promise you wont be sorry mCONS No power supply or USB cable Besides that the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic Get This Pedal,positive
Its very small Its a fabric stretchy capo the old type thats quite difficult to stretch and make stay Its made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo but the end isnt very long and I dont trust it to stay while playing for long Ill keep it as a spare just in case anyway Not real impressed,neutral
Not much to sayI wanted Fended tweed guitar strap and this is the exact item in my sights Thanks it does what its meant to do Fender tweeda standard in the music industry,positive
This Fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along It sounds great and I like the headphone and MP3 player hookups Good value Nice amp,positive
Very happy with these cables Just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job Well made and look and feel sturdy Nice audio cables for the,positive
Buttons itself are fine however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar right above the thread And I even predrill it there is no way I can get it out so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it now slightly offcenter now screw broke inside the guitar,negative
Ive written here before that it would be nice to find a multipedal arrangement for space savingbut I still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds Heres where I landed in my search for the sounds of the 70s,positive
Cheap crappy strap Its too stiff not comfortable at all I regret purchasing this Save your money go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar They are expensive but worth it Cheap strap no good very uncomfortable,negative
These are a bit short only complaintBut I should have known that going into a 6 double right ended cablePerhaps a straight to straight would be betterAnyway besides that they seem to be decent enough qualityI can see a few years of careful use good price,positive
The strings definitely have a good tone though Ive got them on a lowend mandolin They may be more than the mando needs But they sound great Good strings,positive
Bought a couple of these to build preloaded pickguards for strats They work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips There are two rows of connectors Great 5way switch,positive
Not quite as good as the red All Instrument Snark but it gets the job done and the price is right It works,positive
This pedal does exactly what my title suggests it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz very smashing pumpkins feel to this It doesnt do many different tones but what it does it does very well And frankly once I find a good tone out of a pedal I dont change it often anyhow This is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards PS I have the Russian variant smooth rich saturated wall of fuzz,positive
First off Id like to address any construction concerns The nanoKontrol2 is actually sturdier than I imagined it would be despite some of the reviews here The case is rigid plastic as are the rotary knobs and faders and everything seems pretty solid I like the travel feel in the faders not a lot of resistance but not flimsyfeeling either The buttons are soft dense rubber like a pad controller and light up when they are pressed If you have big hands then you might have issues with using this as a live performance controller since everything is in such a compact spaceThe supplied mini USB cable fits nice and snugBottom line if you take reasonable care with this unit it seems like it should give you a lot of dependable serviceI tried this right out of the box with Reason 7 there is no builtin Reason template for it but it was recognized by Reason when I did a controller surface scan and it was a piece of cake to map the top knobs to pan controls and the faders to volume faders and the solo and mute buttons to their counterparts on the Reason mixer Basically I just bought this to do crossfades and the nanoKontrol2 will be perfect for that but I can also see using this to automate some softsynth parameters just as easilyNext I set this up to control Peffs Directre Rack Extension and its a blastThe transport buttons did correctly automap to Reasons transport controls so you can record play stop fast forward and reverse from the nanoKontrol2I didnt download the nanoKontrol2 editor yet but that should increase the utility of this deviceIf the S M and R buttons lit up in different colors all lights are red it would make this unit more useful as a performance controller in my opinion but as it stands this budget mixerperformance control surface is well worth 50 Sweeeet,positive
What can I say Its a cable It works very well on a pedalboard I personally use it to cable my pedal together from the first row to second row That requires a cable longer than 6 or 1 foot The 3 foot is perfect and it works great Convenient,positive
If your looking for a great fast and accurate tuner for your guitar or bass this is the one for you It is easy to see in light or dark venues has great build quality and helps to tune your instrument in record time I dont go anywhere without it it may well be the last tuner youll ever needFlaws are few The battery life could be better and it wont work with acousticsno built in mic but then you know that before you buy it so you cant really complain It would just be nice if it included one is allAll told if you need a great tuner look no further this is one of the best especially for the price paid Why are you still reading this Buy it already EXCELLENT Tuner Period,positive
These pics are perfect for a jazz guitarist and I actually like the coloration too The Ocean Turquoise wasnt nearly as nice a color and I expected a bluish color These are about 7mm and thats just right Fantastic pics,positive
Arrived promptly Nicely packaged Holding my instruments securely Ill likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts Very nice for the price,positive
I love these Dunlop capos They are quick to put on grip nicely and above all they dont get in the way of your hand I bought 5 of them from Amazon because they were such a good price My favorite capo,positive
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box either way the picks are great although i would suggest the Jazz picks over these JACKPOT,positive
So I have these old EV mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled These provided an easy inexpensive solution No complaints A deal,positive
Beware This tuner works by guitar vibration If your playing loud with other people youll have to ask them to stop playing so you can tune Not recommended for band environments Probably ok for solo gigs or home practice Otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars Works great if your jamming by yourself not recommended for a band environment,positive

I bought this harmonica for our sonthe music enthusiast He loves it It seems to be manufactured wellas it is substantive in weight and seems to be solidly built Only time will tell But for now it seems to be a decent harmonica I actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks Couldnt pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price Our son says its easy to use and has a good sound quality Hey if it makes our son happy so be it Highly recommend Pretty Good Harmonica,positive

Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change I also have a Digitech RP50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP50s chorus settings I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele my Applause acousticelectric and my Squier Vintage Modified 70s bass guitar And like other folks whove bought this product Ill most likely be getting some of Danelectros other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply Cant be beat for valuetodollar ratio,positive

The snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything Ive ever seen It does wonders for tuning your guitar and cuts down on the time to tune your guitar The music stores cant seem to keep these in stock because they are so popular The price in the stores is 2000 and at Amazon you can get it for half the price I saw no difficulties with using the tuner and it was up and running on the guitar and is easy to use Miracle worker,positive
I am so happy with this product that after buying the first one I bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin Excellent product for the price,positive
This is a cool little amp Sure its really nothing to write home about but I like being able to take My Strat and just sit somewhere and jam without having to have a Generator to supply the power to conventional Amps I wouldnt perform with it but great for personal use Handy little Box to have,positive
Cant beat these 10 stands They are a bit troublesome to open and collapse the snap buttons are hard to depress But once open they stand up well Since I dont travel much they are great if you use your guitar in a studio and dont travel around much Great stand for a great price,positive

I would definitely buy these strings again They are high quality great durablity and a great price The Martin name is synonymous with quality Excellent Medium duty strings,positive
When you extend it out all the way it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom but other than that this stand is perfect Works really well,positive

A good moderately priced guitar standI had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result I replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware storeA good moderately priced guitar stand I would recommend purchasing it Musicians Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black,neutral
This is an excellent choice if youre looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprintIt looks great its easy to use and its a fantastic size for a delay pedalThe analog delay is nice and warm much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears Also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delaysThere is a internal adjustment that I dont think I will need to use for now anywayI highly recommend it Just cant beat it,positive
It was suggested that I start with this product since Im learning and adding it to my repertoire of instruments Comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding Nice sound and quality,positive
I love the Tortex 50mm picks red I have one thats over 4 years old and still going strong Yes the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings I use the red yellow and orange Tortexs exclusively for practice and performance Im a church worship leader My highest recommendation Fantastic Pickslast forever,positive

I bough this amp for my 9 year old son who is learning guitar for his Christmas present I thought that since I love Fender guitars and since he has a mini Squier wed like to get something in the Fender Family I seriously expected a cheap imitation of a Line 6 Spider with a Fender logo slapped on it I should have had more faith in FenderI am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp The AMP models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool I have ever used The amps dont sound digital or processed they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain You would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it I cant get over the Bassman the twin Reverb and the Deluxe They sound so full and strongMy biggest compliment of the Mustang is that it is the ONLY modeling amp that has great sounding Vintage tones Line 6 has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones Vox has never really made great modeling stuff Digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terribleIf you play Blues Rock Classic Rock Country Funk etc This amp is for you There is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for Modern Metal but Metalheads might be better off with the Line 6 stuffThe other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls By looking at the controls you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound You dont need to dive 5 levels deep into an LCD screen in order to make great sounding tweaksBut if you like to go deep youll love the Fender Fuse software It is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your soundThe fact that Fender not only included FUSE with this amp but also the Ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything is just frosting on the cakeI am a father of 4 who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing with the added features of a headphone jack and an AUX in I can play whenever I want I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at allThe value of this amp is amazing People will shell out 23x as much for a Line 6 modeler but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the Fender tones Bought it for my Kid Now Im buying it for myself,positive
If its good enough to track Tom Pettys vox on the heartbreakers albums its good enough for the rest of us Sounds great on amps and perc Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100 My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha hope he doesnt read this review Its a shame the new mics coming out wireless stuff they make IE Presentor PG seies digital series etc are such flimsy pieces of garbage This is the last of the cool from Shure Classic the last of Shures good mics,positive
I use the 15 mm Dunlop Gator Grip for twenty years The nonslip surface doesnt take long to wear off but I have a workaround Ive even put them in a vice and filed new points on them I prefer an extra heavy pick because theres no delay from pick deflection Gator grip picks are my favorite and Ive always used 15 mm,positive
We bought the PylePro Lavalier Wireless Microphone System for use with thePyle Pwma230 We needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice For the price this worked a lot better than I expected but it did take some adjustment to the Trim Screw on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed We also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasnt hanging in front of the speaker this might not be an issue for you depending on where you plug yours inThere are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that Im sure would provide better sound and range but this one works just fine for our usesOverall a good value for the low cost of this unit Good Wireless Mic For The Price Recommended,positive
What a fantastic product I believe I have been wishing for this for yearsOnly one problem Make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spotNo longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal boardI have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is TUFFI you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you needI just wish I could get paid for endorsing this productStill holding strong building another board and using this stuff its much better than regular velcro I dont have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away I wished for this,positive
These Snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick I use the mic instead of the vibration setting though Thats my preference But I would use no other tuner on stage I have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars I have dozens of guitars Excellent product,positive
I bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot It works like a champ Im a stickler for genuine OEM parts so I typically by Fender only Cool Beans,positive
This is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested Great portability for the priceHOWEVER having read reviews across multiple sites I too am a victim of the HORRIBLE glue smell that so many others have complained about I really liked the guitar so I purhcased it from two separate retailers but had to return both due to the horrific smell I even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smellfree case And they sent a case But it stunk too Its a shame I had to return them because they were nice little guitars Great guitar but BEWARE the smell,neutral
Disappointing was looking for to receiving theseBut mostly they are unplayable Leak air badly Easier learning bagpipes than these thingsSave your money and get some harps that actually workDecent case though Useless,negative
I have had a Korg CA30 tuner for a few years which I really likeI wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unitInitially I bought a Boss TU80 for more money but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM40and the batteries rattled around in their compartmentAlso I like having the middle green LED for tuningThe price here cant be beat and its a well built item that works greatI was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much but they take more pressure that it would seem and there is a delay until it turns on or off so that turned out not to be an issueI am not real hot for the color but its nicely made and works well so I will live with itI especially like the little folding stand in the back rather than having to find an old credit card Great,positive
These headphones are wonderful to wear They sound great But thats not enough now a days With the head band being connected to the outside of the muff they fit your head so wide The pioneer hdj 2000 has the look Read my review on those though They are terribleAt first glance these things are serious pro grade they are made of very durable components Both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head The head band isnt bad its a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued Not really a big concern though They have a long cord and Ill talk more about it later It ends with a spin on 14 in or a standard 35mmThe sound out of these things is pristine Its not muddy and very clear They have a good amount of bass Because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also dont leak noise like a lot of headphones doPros Heavy duty Awesome sound Comfortable headband Over ear design Not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag Always clear never muddy even at high volumes Very clear left and right ear markings Spin on 14 PlugCons Heavy coil cord Heavy weight never got annoying though Looks They sound great are ruged comfortalbe But they look terrible,positive
Very durable cables Ive used them all Fenders arent bad I have used these without any problems whatsoever See for yourself Good stuff,positive
I use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great The clean and distortion channels both sound good paired with the Danelectro Model 59 M Perfect for a small apartment,positive
This is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clearcoat Theres one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pickguard mounts to the underside of the body Neither would be apparent to someone who wasnt appraising the guitar but they are there and dont look normal to me Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from blackpainted models My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesnt match at all Im guessing that its a joint that has been glued together I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a onepiece neck and since I didnt read about this one having something different I assumed it would be the same Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some Still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery Im not sure that seeing these finish issues beforehand wouldve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar but upon reflection it wouldve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buyingMy remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap even while sitting The top strap peg is angled up slightly where guitars with horns have them angled down which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul the pegs just dont stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars Its great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that 34real34 Les Paul guitars do but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated 09 strings without additional hardwareThe guitar sounds decent it looks pretty great although not quite as pretty as the pictured one and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars Note the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars it doesnt indicate that this is less than a 34fullsized34 guitar Though this is a fine guitar for the price Im not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again My mistake for buying sight unseen,neutral
This is a great value I was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this It doesnt sound exactly like an sm57 but it will get you close You can EG your amp to compensate for the difference Great mic for the price,positive
The stand is very well constructed and very stable The other stands that I have used were all bottom holders I was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder but then againall guitar stores display their guitars with themso I thought lets have a go Im glad I did My stand doesnt tip over like the others You just have to lift up before you take your instrument out The fingers in front hold the instrument in lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument Stable and well constructed,positive
No matter how many times I hard reset my 3Gs no success There is no problem with my jack and the phone is in pristine condition no problems until now There is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work but thats about it I registered my Amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box I tested the iRig with an iPhone 4 and was able to get it operatingI am giving this two stars because it did work on my friends iPhone 4 But for my purposes with a 3Gs it is a brick If anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation I will rerate the product Does not work with my iPhone 3Gs,negative
Some people are not comfortable using the drywall anchors that are included with this hanger If the drywall anchors are installed correctly you will have no worries about it pulling out of the drywall I have used these drywall anchors for 10 years now to hang heavy wood blinds which are raised and lowered daily without anchor failure Concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger The only options are the drywall anchors They are good to go Works As Advertised,positive
This is a great little uke for the money Ive bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts As many have noted tuning stability improves GREATLY after the strings stretch in One suggestion If youre willing to add a 47 bucks to the purchase price buy a set of DAddario or Aquila strings and put them on right away The stock strings are pretty poor even a set of 4 dollar strings is a vast improvement Other than that I love these little guys and plan to keep on buying them Finally if you buy this or any other uke do yourself a favor and watch the movie Mighty Uke You wont stop smilingDAddario J65 Ukulele Strings SopranoAquila AQS Nylgut Soprano Ukulele StringsMighty Uke The Amazing Comeback of a Musical Underdog Nice little uke for the with one caveat,positive
Although this is hardly a highend microphone it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument although the output signal seems like it could be stronger The stand is sturdy too So this is probably not the best choice for the fulltime professional musician but for busking around or playing in clubs its worth a look Decent Microphone and Stand Combo,positive
Ive always been partial to 88 picks I used the standard dunlop nylon for years The max grip just is very difficult to drop effortless to hold on to Because its so effortless to hold I can focus my attention on other things My current favorite,positive
We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long I hope it does because this nady sp4c is a very impressive mic for the price We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose Nice Surprise,positive
Im an amateur sound tech Weve been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singerssong leaders liked it very much than the other mics that weve had before Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah For me it sounded better than SM58 My songleaders have tested it and guess what they dont want to use the SM58 anymore Better Than SM58,positive
I first used this pedal when my green screemer died A friend had and os2 on hand and let me use it I had used Bosss metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking So I plug into the OS2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS2 pedal produced I play through a 59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end my search ended with this pedal I highly recomend this pedal to any rock blues metal country or punk guitar player Great Pedal,positive
I just got done installing these My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time and my guitars wont tip over either Not only was this the least expensive solution out there but also the most space efficient to keep my wife happyI used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud You can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers didnt get covered with drywall mud Once youve found one screw then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart With the mounts screwed into wood studs I dont see any way these are coming down The mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic to my heavy electric Strat to my mandolin beautifullyGotta love Amazon With so many options to choose from you can come up with something great and inexpensive too And the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the productBTW this seller really got these to me fast This was a great buying experience Thanks DisplayGiftSCOM Dirt Cheap Inexpensive Effective and Space Efficient,positive
I was amazed how much better this stand was then the one I had just bought at Guitar Center for the same price I thought they would be the same but they were not This stand is built much better So much better then the one at Guitar Center for the same price,positive

great for carrying with you works as it should good price I would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot Works as it should very portable,positive
Actually it was really easy to installi just losen 6543 string and just put it in and it was overi felt volume coming out from sound hole is bigger than beforebut tone i dont know maybe im dumb enough to not notice It wasnt that hard,positive
I had the SN1 Guitar Tuner this one the SN2 is actually for all instruments if Im not mistaken and it works great Never fails I love the red the swivel head the greenred lights when tuning Just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it I dont use anyting other than Snark tuners,positive
Sorry I dont like these as theyre just too big They stand out too much They do work and theyre effective but they are too pronounced There are many good alternatives strap gaskets strap locks undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap Again they work but theyre not aesthetic nor elegant I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play Not cool Too Big,negative
Got this to tune my guitar without relying on Rocksmith on my PS3 and to double check against it I have a pretty crappy ear so I rely on it to tune correctly Responds fast display is INCREDIBLE I wish my car dash looked like this thing Fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind Tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument not using a microphone so you can tune even if it is noisy And any pedals effects amps etc in the setup do not affect the tone you are tuning the actual resonance of the string Even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well Forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too For the price I would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one Amazing Great performance from such a small simple device,positive
With how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky even for a right angle but they still sound good Bulky plugs but sound is good,neutral
Works Great Its a good product Just what i expected I expect to buy more of these in the future And for its price its well worth it GREAT GOOD STURDY PIECE,positive
For the price this is an amazing pedal The sound from a 40 pedal is outstanding much better than I ever expectedThe Voodoo is a fuzz pedal meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box the sustain is big All was not completely perfect it might be me and the way Im adjusting this but I had a bit of trouble with feedbackFrom a sound standpoint this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound Combined with Joyos California Hendrix is almost in the house Joyo JF15 Guitar Effect Pedal California Sound True BypassI have a Boss ME70 multieffect pedal This Joyo single effect pedal blows away my Boss pedal Im almost sad to say that I dont have experience with other single effect pedals so I cant make a comparison to those more costly pedalsI have a Marshall Amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers My guitar is a Gibson Les Paul 2008 Standard PlusFrom a construction standpoint these are remarkable for the price point The whole thing has a good weight The base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it The box is a solid cast metal box with a very heavy metal base The bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box The 14 inch input and output jacks are really sweet there is a metal insert that screws into the plastic internal jack It looks to me like it would be very hard to break this jack that outer ring is heavy duty The pots look really good For this pedal they went with press on knobs If the knob ever breaks they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch Given that it is between three knobs I think it would be hard to break this switch but it is a little lighter weight than I would likeThe pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery It also has a standard 9V power jack on the side to use an AC adapter or large rechargeable battery packThis is not a high end pedal at this price point nobody should ever expect that But darn it this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price Well worth the investmentThe GateShop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review Really Nice For the Price,positive
It was great to get quality Christmas gifts that my son was pleased with The budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town So thanks to Amazon for making this possible Love on line shopping with Amazon,positive
It sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board If thats not a problem definitely worth the price Too much noise,neutral
I bought this not for the tuner but because I needed a metronomeHowever I had to give the tuner a try as well With my trustySnark SN1 Tunerattached to my guitars headstock and this Snark SN4 on the table I proceeded to tune my guitar I was impressed that both tuners were showing identical tuning even down to the fluctuations as the note rang outAs a metronome I dont know what kind of frills others may offer but this does everything I need to keep in timeI only have one minor complaint You cant view the Snark SN4 at any kind of sharp angle You need to view it head on If you place it on your music sheet stand thats great But if its not facing you or lying flat on a desk you may have trouble reading the screen An integrated flip out kickstand would make this perfect Great product but it needs a kickstand,positive
I love the strings so far just put them on my Jasmine by Takamine guitar today 22014 and they sound amazing very bright tone I will be using DAddario strings from now on very pleased with them Very Nice Strings,positive
Getting a proper pedal power unit like Voodoo labs DC brick Ciok is recommended Even though this has a lot of outlets each pedal may not receive enough power I usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok Any more than that and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals May not power some pedals that have a high current draw Good for power in an emergency,neutral
We ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered 2 more You can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar and minimize string stress and detuning each time you move your capo Very nice product This is a nice capo perfect for Classical Guitars,positive
This is the best clip on tuner out there Its dead accurate doesnt bounce around like dial needle tuners and its EASY TO READ You just clip it to your headstock either acoustic or electric turn it on position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly Highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or Dobro There are other tuners by Snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges so check out what suits your needs Excellent Tuner,positive
This is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most It will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which I love Some people have complained about plastic hinges being fragile but they are fine if you dont use excessive muscle Better than the average bear,positive
Im on the fence with this product It does its job so no real complaints there however once applied I feel it may be damaging my frets I havent seen wear or visible damage but as you run it up the neck of the guitar you hear it hit all the frets If you apply pressure to keep it from hitting it then pulls the top cleaning pad off away from the strings causing it not to clean the top Much more convenient then using a string cleaning cloth though so Im sticking with this Does its job,neutral
I have used this winder now 4 times It does what it is supposed to do and adds to speed and efficiency of the task Works just fine,positive
Ive had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it Its choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me I dont have the greatest guitar ever but the sounds from the amp are clean and crisp The choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other lessuseful effects The auxillary jack is also a great addition The amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use Great amp better price,positive
I had no problems at all getting a brand new poly pro strap on these Even if it was too snug it wouldnt have been hard to work a strap on to these I dont know why people are saying bad things about this product If your dealing with guitars there much harder things to do with guitars than getting a snug leather strap onto the locks Dont listen to the whiners These are what they need to be Oh yeah I LOVE THESE STRAP LOCKS,positive
I needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons This worked well for that very nice,positive
The best part of this pick is that it is easier on my strings it still gives the pick tone but seems to do less damage Good Stuff,positive
I ordered this Epi Jr because I had one years ago my Son adopted for his own and missed having one Saw this in TV yellow and had to have it I came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website It was setup very well among the few guitars I have purchased that were playable out of the box Fret work is top notch Finish is good some very slight blems but if you play it like you should youll add some of your own There was a slight binding in the nut most people think its the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut A quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up If you cant make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech When you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue The only thing I did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream Plugged in it sounds good you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone Picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound Play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in Tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound Add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region This guitar will make you a more versatile player The absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out Sustain is very good as a result I could carry on forever but you get the idea Ive been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that I own many vintage guitars including Gibson Fender Gretsch I have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports the quality is superb on the most recent ones Tone snobs may laugh but my new Epi Les Paul Jr plays just as well as most anything out there Simplicity at its best,positive
I was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate if not be indistinguishable from the audio quality of the heavyduty Shure microphones used at WGTD FM HD All the mics that I had previously tried at this price point and lower including Blues Snow line sounded overly treblish with pronounced sibilance listen to the comparisoncontrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration By contrast the Yeti is rich and resonant and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter Short of spending 45 times more Im convinced this is the best option in my particular caseAt the same time as a musician without a home studio I seriously doubt Ill make much use of the mic for performance or recording As far as performance goes the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation upstaging the performer at least a vocalist with a normalsized head And for traveling purposes Ive found the Sansom Go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer even though Blues literature shows the Yeti alongside a laptopBlue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product Its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservationsperhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of Blues lighter more compact microphones Its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility But as other reviewers have mentioned the volume gain and pattern knobs are rather loose allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement The knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ballbearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment Theres the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain controls circular movement but its not at the 12 oclock position so its difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a midpoint for quick and easy assessment of positioningIn sum the Yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparablypriced mics and it should prove a useful not to mention handsome addition to any home studio Its still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior Its main competitor on Amazonthe Audio Technica AT2020is pintsized compared to the Yeti and Ill confess Im still not sure whether I made the best choice the 2 mics have been alternating in the 1 and 2 slots of bestselling mics on Amazon for 3 months now I wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the ATs relative compactness and light weight come at a compromisehowever slightto audio qualityI experienced initial hesitancy on Yetis part to make an appearance in the Input and Output panels in System Preferences of my iMac Then I read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub Plugged directly into a USB port on my computer Yeti immediately sprang into action My hunch is that a good powered 4port hub would be equally effective Blue Yeti vs AT2020,positive
Use this on my Taylor acousticelectric which does not have a built in tuner Love it it hides very nicely on the headstock your audience wont even see it What else can I say its accurate it works it clamps on really neatly securely its a great price it has not marred the finish on my Taylors headstock in any way etc Id recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a builtin tuner Would definitely buy again These are so cool that everyone should have at least one of these even if you dont need one So Cool Everyone Should Have One Even if You Dont Need One,positive
This stand holds up my ukulele so yay Folded up it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the Hola gig bag which I also use and heartily recommend Make no mistake this stand is not pretty it feels and looks like cheap plastic but it does the job Great stand fits inside Hola ukulele gig bag,positive
This clamp on pair of miniature lamps does an excellent job of illuminating music set lists and notes The manufacturer claims 12 lumens of light which is roughly equivalent to a 1 Watt bulb but the lens and the way the light is diffused make them seem much brighter Since the design keeps the light somewhat directional they are relatively discreet and will not interfere with others on the stage in the studio or in the audienceThe three batteries will last 28 hours of continuous use according to the spec sheet and that is in the ballpark of the use time I am getting between battery changesWhat I love is the dual heads each on a gooseneck that is over a foot long The length gives you a lot of flexibility no pun intended for placing the lights exactly where you want them The goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to The clamp is perfect for most stands and has a layer of padding to prevent marring surfaces The manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing Frankly that is a stretch and I would recommend a light designed with a larger base if that is what you are really looking for This one does work beautifully clamped to music stands and the illumination will cover both pages of a chart Bright while remaining discreet,positive
Ive tried leather straps Ive tried Rocksteady straps I still keep coming back to this strap Its steady Highly adjustable And it works very nicely with the Dunlop Dual Design Straplok system Good job Ernie Ball I even prefer this to a nice Levys strap that I own because the Ernie Ball strap is a bit slipperier My favorite strap by far,positive
You cant beat these for the price I use them on 3 of my guitars 2 2734 scale baritones in A and B and a 247534 standard scale in CI got a 12pack elsewhere for under 4 bucks a set They sound really good No breakage problems etc Nice for the price,positive
Ive used all sorts of strings over the years and generally aim for GHS strings However these Power Slinky strings are great Ive not broken one yet and the 1148 is a good gauge Heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played I may become a lifelong Ernie Ball user after using these strings Power Slinky gives power sound,positive
I almost gave it 4 stars since you have to be smart to assemble it Directions dont include the proper details I would write them but thats their job I spend 20 minutes instead of 5 or so it they explained the process better The stand with my guitars looks awesome Its perfect for 23 acoustics and 12 electric guitars I wouldnt load it with 7 since they would inevitably bump while putting them in or taking them out Nice addition to my studio Great product and price,positive
A bit more expensive then other strings But theire worth it the tone is outstanding They last a long time they never rally come out of tune and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string Ive tryed The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone Not to dark not to bright Just perfectThese strings are worth it worth evry penny,positive
This stand surprised my It is lightweight but is still sturdy I wouldnt venture to use it on the road all the time But as a backup stand I wouldnt hesitate I like it much better than my musicians gear stand though if this had a double extendable boon it would be perfect Great value for the money but not perfect,positive
It was delivered fast When I hooked it up I didnt expect it to be so loud and clear So powerful it picked up every breath I took between the lyrics When I put a wind screen on it the sound was so nice I couldnt stop singing for another hour I only meant to test it when I unpacked it Im buying more At that price its a steal Get a couple NOW Before supply and demand kicks in A Very Nice Mic Super Clean Sound,positive
Not cheap as far as pics are concerned but its definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then If youre new it helps you find what you like if youre experience you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound Good variety of pics to figure out just what youre looking for,positive
Didnt think Id be compelled to review something like a guitar pick but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far I use the 60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing but they do wear down and fray on the edges and have a little more friction that Id likeThis Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming while being rigid enough for individual notesSome reviewers have noted that they crack after some use If that turns out to be a problem I might reconsider my review But out of the box they perform as well as any pick I have used My new pickofchoice replacing the Dunlop Orange,positive
these Fender pickguard screws are excellent they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment I replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and theyre much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent excellent for any project,positive
These are great Theyre small Light weight Easy to read Accurate Inexpensive This one offers an additional feature Tap Tempo Metronome Small Great price Easy to read,positive
I gave it a 5 star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks but this 6ft cord is taller than i am which means its about 6 234 tall its a great product for the money exspecially if its just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp its short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working a great little cord,positive
The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didnt make much difference I hope it goes away with useThe string cutter works like a champ I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings These work much better They dont cut the string they shear it off Ive done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter does the job but winder squeaks,positive
I have this paired with the Behringer C1 Studio Condenser Microphone It matches the mic well colorwise and fit The C1 fits the mount perfectly I recommend this mount highlyqid1358133926sr81keywordsBehringerC1 Excellent Mount,positive
Clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio I did drop it a couple times ok maybe more than a couple on the wood floors of stages without a problem Then one day in the frigidly cold outdoors I dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered oops Clear sound but dont drop it,neutral
Im not sure what I was expecting This definitely is a fuzz but the one I got doesnt seem to have much in the way of subtlety Its either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much Its not bad and its probably just my personal preferences but this just isnt my cup of tea Not bad no reason to be excited,neutral
This pedal has a great range of function with variable width and depth along with an independent level control and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs It also has a dry through outputIt can go from low depth high speed shimmers to high depth low speed oscillations to ridiculous warbleThe pedal is light weight very high quality durable quite good looking and all around a good pedal to play around withCons The blue led like many blue leds is VERY bright I usually cover them up with a sticker so I can see the setting on the pedalIt can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in this can frighteningly spark So make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall Good price warm rich chorus,positive
After reviewing people reviewer I had no dout It great and it sure was Snark has a GOOD TUNER for low price Thank to Amazon and Snark I think anyone needs a tunersnark is the best for your money Just what I Expect,positive
The Snark SN5 Tuner for Guitar Bass and Violin gives me spot on tuning I especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner When playing music with other musicians who are also tuning or warming up I dont have to be concerned with hearing myself pluck the strings of my guitar or violin while comparing the sound to a pitch pipe or keyboard This tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrumentI decided to buy this tuner after another musician lent me his extra one during a jam session I was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself ASAP Spot On Tuning,positive
This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables The included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respectThe mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows smooth midrange and crisp highs For almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production The sound is unbelievable especially at this price For under twenty dollars this PylePro mike cant be beatOne issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue but usually not when using the XLR input Great Vocalist and Announcers Mike,positive
These strings sound great and so far have held tune well after a couple of days of stretching I have them on my Luna 12 string and the sound is rich I would purchase them again Great strings,positive
Planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff All of the cables in my pedalboard are planet waves Great as always,positive
Bought these and they worked great with my Digitech delay reverb chorus and Jaman No noticeable noise added to my ears They continue to work to this day They are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap GOOD VALUE Good,positive
This is a good product These work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on I like Work Great,positive
for the price and options u can not beat this pedal i just sound great with acoustic or electric guitar thank u guys your pedals really kick butt more than satisfied,positive
For the price and the fast shipment despite a notice that said it would take 2 months to ship it is well worth the money Does what its supposed to do so far I can imagine that a lot of use may eventually wear out its springiness but for now it is working great for my needs I dont capo too much just getting into learning some new songs that require it so cheap was the way to go for me I could see someone who capos a lot might want to look elsewhere but if youre only needing something simple and cheap look no further Works as expected,positive
I bought this for my teen son for Christmas He loves to play his bass and sing along He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model Nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy We did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put Shure knocked this one out of the park This Shure is a great mic,positive
I was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my Fender beginners mandolin set worried Id permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them Having a dozen similara few for me and a few to sharemeets the need He heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks Heavy solid good grip,positive
Very pleased with timely arrival of the package Excited to use it with my new guitar but after only two days of actual use it broke The plastic tension section just snapped off Very disappointed Acoustic Guitar Capo,neutral
use them for home recording nothing on the road for that purpose these are made well wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly good cables for home use,positive
Nice thumbpicks for banjo They are size large so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you I have a larger hand and they work well but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug But I like them a lot Would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if thats whay youre into though I always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick Good thumbpick for banjo,positive
This stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use It is well made and I would buy it again if needed Very Nice,positive
For any usable tones while playing live the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp Direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiringI didnt like the recorded tones either much rather preferred Amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasnt an optionThat being said it is good for practice and song writing Used this for more than a year and finally sold it Thats the other thing with items like this they lose value real quick once the next version comes out Good for practice,negative
For a while I had the SN5 tuner But I bought this one and Im glad a did Its fast accurate reliable The product picture can be a little deceiving The color is a a metallic blue almost navy Its got some good features although I dont use them Ill use nothing but snarks This is what you want,positive
Ive never had these before until recently I ordered a set and it worked so well that I BOUGHT a couple more The couple more that came in had a wider slot on them I thought that was weird but didnt think to much about it until I started moving some PICS AROUND Turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well This Picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones Pick Holder,neutral
Works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help Comparing it to my old BOSS TU12 dedicated guitar tuner this works just as good Used for electric acoustic guitars,positive
This thing Rocks Unlike other cheap Chinesemade ripoffs ahem Behringer These Joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny Review of Joyo Power Supply,positive
I bought this to 34daisychain34 two small Kustom powered PA cabinets Virtually all of the XLR cables available were way too long for my application This cable filled the bill perfectly Perfect for connecting devices,positive
Very nice guitar picks for the very fair price I like them very much Of course I am just a beginner Nice Picks,positive
This bench is great for the keyboards and when I just want to sit and play by bass guitar Regarding it being too short you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height to sitting If it is too short then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description I also had no problem with a bait n switch issue Great bench,positive
Yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows But this tool is very well designed It keeps the guitar from sliding and positions it at a nice angle for maintenance In storage mode the mat rolls up into the clear plastic tube and takes up very little space The bottom cover doubles as a storage compartment for your hex wrenches string winder and feeler guagesBut the real reason I give this product five stars is because it allows me to work on my guitars while keeping them in perfect condition That increases their resale value so the tool pays for itself And it gives me a lot of pleasure to have the right tools for the job With the right tools I enjoy working on my guitars almost as much as playing them While I hear what those complaining of the high cost are saying I am used to paying higher prices for good tools and I think this qualifies as a good tool I used it to put new pickups in and setup my Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging my guitar Without this tool I dont think I would have been so lucky Worth the Cost IMHO,positive
This was a filler item for a much larger order I am very interested in the Straplocks so I decided to give them a try I sincerely like the concept Custoemr comments,positive
By far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass Applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets wipes right up A must to keep wood looking fresh Accept no other,positive
Product does what you would think I use it on my bass and havent had a problem with it yet If you are constantly playing shows this may not be your first choice but if you just need something to hold your guitar or bass up then this is it You cant beat the price Great cheap strap,positive
I dont know if 39 from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body I know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adultHowever for 50 its on sale at the time even if its not I can still learn to play since thats why I bought it is to learnThe pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesnt really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fineAll togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty goodI am happy with itGood clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp I haveComes with Whammy barthats what I know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your ampEDITSo now that Amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that I have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit I have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume Not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning 39 inch guitar,positive
I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick My guitar would probably not be happy without it does the trick,neutral
Just skimming through the other reviews I see that at least one other reviewer has complained about the same thing Nearly every time you pick up your guitar the rest will fall off your desk The part that sits on the desk shouldve been weighted to prevent this from happening Its a nice idea and does what it says it keeps your guitar nice and safe from scuffs when leaned up against your deskBut considering this one REALLY annoying flaw I wonder if I shouldnt have just payed a couple more bucks for another guitar stand instead of this rest Nice but keeps falling off the desk,neutral
I bought this mainly for the string cutter although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well At first I was skeptical because its lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings Im happy to say that it does an excellent job much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly Its nice not having to carry the pliers around which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock As for the bridge pin puller I tried it once but it is rather ineffective I think it was included more as an afterthought as its just a notched edge and cant really pull stuck pins For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensiveOverall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter Id recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case Excellent string cutter,positive
This is one of the quietest mixers Ive ever used The range of adjustability is excellent 12 channels fill up quickly but Ive mixed 10 at a time and nearly no noise at least I dont hear any Low Noise High Gain,positive
The connection strap is a great enhancement for my D18 and fits wonderfully Just one cautionI noticed a couple of scratches on the neck near the Headstock and finally determined that the Button was pressing on the neck when in the caseI have occasion to pack and unpack several times per month Its easy to connect and disconnect so thats the Prevention Mode I now have in place Wonderful setup and I highly recommend it to to ALL Martin Owners Excellentbut with caution,positive
This same chord was almost 30 bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you wont trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today great chord great price,positive
I have been using the EXPs for some time now on electicacoustics and they have become my goto string I find the coating to be less noticeable than on Elrs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and settoset Highly recommended Best coated string,positive
Old screws rust and often when presented with a new pick guard there are 11 instead of 8 holes for attachment This package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar Also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms Needed and right size,positive
Very nice quality part Fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed But my MexiStrat is now complete The finishing touch,positive
See my previous evaluation on a similar product It is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be ee my previous eval,positive
Lets cut to the chase this is more or less a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil But thats exactly what I need to clean and protect my fretboard The lubricating feature is just a nice plus The best fretboard treatment I have ever used,positive
Ive never been much of an effect pedal guy lots of batteries and cables when I can just get a good tone direct into my Fender tweed Ive recently conceded to using more effects and have gone quite frankly hog wild on new gear This is the best of the pedal purchases I have made so far its not quite the MXR sound I was going for but theres definitely something here The boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my StratJust two controls one for volume one for compression My only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy I havent pulled them off yet but I would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones Didnt even know I needed this,positive
Ive been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands as Im rather petite Luckily for me we found one of these secondhand it needed minimal repairsand its just great I dont know anything about purchasing it new but I can tell you that this is a great beginners instrument for someone who has small hands Ill also note that its even affordable while its brand newThe notes are surprisingly cleansounding coming from a guitar thats so lowpriced Id definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument My First Guitar,positive
This can work but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money It will work if you use your guitar next to the a table Simplenot worth the money,neutral
They are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them I had earnie ball on previously and I might switch back or go to dunlop witch I put on my 7 sting and love But I probably wont get these again Ever Ehhh,neutral
Happy to have Black connectors on an XLR cable that doesnt cost a ton I use these for a short run to my mixer from my Line 6 Pod They work great Not the greatest mic cable but for the price they cant be beat They work great,positive
Sorry Fenderthis one is just a waste of money Get something better that doesnt twist up an ravel into knots No not this one,negative
I bought this strap because I thought the pattern was awesome The comfort is okay I never wear it for more than a couple hours at a time But just the design man go planet waves The Design,positive
It works well I use it for my Oscar Schmidt I dont use it for feedback I use it to protect it from the dust It fits tight but its fine IT WORKS GREAT,positive
The Cry Baby has proven itself since the 60s It is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock It takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level A Classic,positive
I love this pedal I bought one used at GC the other day for 30 and never looked back Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better I have it set so the level is set to 900 Low is set to 100 High is set to 900 and the Gain is set to next tuesday I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchyFor a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands downMaxon 808 150Ibanez TS9 100Digitech Bad Monkey 60Joyo Vintage OD 50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 12 times better Bad Little Monkey,positive
Love it I finally found one that supports my 12 strings Alvarez jumbo acoustic guitar Five Stars,positive
I ordered these as my first mic cords for a pair of dynamic mics I recently bought They are very flexible easy to handle and of good quality Even though the jacket material is flexible it seems strong and I have no fear of it tearing The ends are sturdy metal and they include a pair of velcro straps to keep the unused length if any under control I am very satisfied with these cords and would highly recommend them Good cords at a GREAT price,positive
small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you great little tuner,positive
These are excellent inexpensive guitar strings They are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently For the more casual player these might not be the best choiceFor the gigging musician there is nothing better than these DAddario strings They are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive These might take a very slight nod over Ernie Ball stringsFor the more casual musician somebody that isnt changing their strings once a week these are probably not a great choice Personally I use Elixir strings on my electric guitars a Les Paul 2008 Standard and a 1982 Gibson Lucille I do not play gigs so a set of strings doesnt see an hour or two of really hard playing per night The coating on Elixirs helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers I like their feel a bit better than these strings I get about a month of playing from those strings Sadly these DAddario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playingIve tried a variety of strings Ernie Ball Elixir and DAddario on my guitars and the way I play the Elixirs just sound and play the best to me Of course your mileage may vary If I did start to play gigs I would probably switch to a more affordable string like theseA silly cosmetic thing I hate the packaging of these strings DAddario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products The strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside Each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge I change strings myself and I really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings with the gauge clearly printed on the package If you are new to changing strings or only change them infrequently this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you Especially at first I preferred to work with one string at a timeDAddario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings Their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic I kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started They could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessaryIn the end the silly colored balls at the end of the strings well they look goofy on my guitars I wouldnt mind the colors on an acoustic the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway but those balls are visible on my electric guitar I just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings Good For Gigging Musicians,neutral
I got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass I had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses Also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use I had never used strap locks before and dont think I will again Not satisfied with purchase,negative
Ok I replaced my Boss DD3 with this pedal because the boss was the only digital pedal I had left on my board and I wanted a complete analog board This pedal is more subtle then the Boss but if you want some delay to fatten up those lead tones and retain the sound of your amp then look no further MXR is by far better then Boss IMHO and I do love my DD3 Analog delay goodness,positive

PROS Small Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf If using USB does not need external power supply Very convenient Easytouse accessible controls Preamp power works well with condenser studio mikes Plug play with Windows 8 Didnt have to install any kind of driver Variety of input options Dual track with lowhigh volume sliders LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range Easy to adjust Awesome for those who need a minimixer and costs the same as a USBbased preamponly device Free shipping gotta like thatCONS Only one power setting 15v That may not be enough for some but works great with my studio mike Line In USB buttons somewhat confusing nonintuitive However the manual shows exact settings for computer use As with other lowend Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out Can take some fiddling to overcome it Its pretty easy to overpower the computers input and cause distortion Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds goodNOTESI purchased this for use with my studio mike which I hadnt been able to use with my computer due to preamp power needs Plugged it in worked first time no problemsThis unit is very sensitive If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room With a bit of tweaking is fine for studio work I use it for guitarvoice solo live Internet music showsOverall Im quite pleased with the unit The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isnt perfect but then its only fifty bucks For the price overall quality ease of setup range sensitivity and plugandplay I dont think one could find a better unit Two thumbs up I dont know how a Pro would rate this but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studioquality mike above the quality of the average USB microphones available on the market You not only get a preamp but a duochannel stereo volume mixer in the deal Hard to beat at that priceADDENDUM A few days after the initial review I just used the device on a live guitarvoice webcast No background hiss very good clear sound crisp no distortion excellent transmission Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance Quite pleased with this little mixerpreampHINTS AND TIPSTwo good hints on this one Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6volt lantern battery or 3 to 4 AA cells hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound I have found this to be true It pretty much takes over your entire sound system For some folks this will be fine For others they may not appreciate this So what I did was uninstall the drivers remove it from the computer USB which seems to defeat the purpose but wait and plugged it into one of those new portableUSB power supplies you plug right into the wall theyre available all over for between 5 and 10 This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound the programs it uses or causing problems with programs like AudacityYou then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device You are instead powering it from a USB wallsocket and simply using it as a quality minimixer which function it performs very well Thats what I finally did and am still most happy with this deviceIn addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use You could use this with Windows Mac Linux or pretty much anything because all youre really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard linein out cables Works very well in this capacity Gotta love those new external USB power nodes Excellent Portable Mixer,positive
WOW is all i can really say It made a good solid state amp 80s Yamaha usamade combo sound great and full of nice warm tones Im using it into the power amp section via effects loop bypassing the yamaha preamp and I couldnt be more happy with the results This ranks right up there as the best money I ever spent on equipment A definite upgrade Joyo JF13 AC Tone Vintage Tube Amplifier effects pedal,positive
This will make your fretboard smile It takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new A few dabs goes a long way so this 4 ounce bottle should last you a long time If your fretboard is really dry faded apply heavily and allow it soak in Continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry I was amazed at how this made a dull faded 40 year old Fender fretboard came back to life Food of the Fretboards,positive
I bought this Capo for myWashburn D10 It works on my Orlando classical guitar as well I wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasnt too expensive and the Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits the bill nicelyUpdate 72510 My Orlando guitar was stolen Boo Hoo Easy On Easy OffThe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off Rubberized ClampsRubberized clamps helps prevent the Kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets ErgonomicThe arched arm with the weirdlooking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the Kyser Capo DurableThe Kyser is made from durable aluminumUpdate 72510 Ive had this capo for almost 3 years and its still working like a champ According to Amazons Instant Order Update for moi I got this capo on November 22 2007 The Same Capo Colbie Caillat Used in BubblyCheck out the music video Its the same capo Colbie Caillat used inBubblyThe Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo is excellent I dont think you can go wrong with this one Works For Me,positive
I already use the EXL111 as my goto electric string and tried these as part of the Vine program I have to say I really couldnt feel the difference From what I can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the D string gauge is 25 whereas the same string in the EXL111 set is 24 Since the string construction and plating is the same I have to assume these will have the same longevity I guess as long as both are still available EXL111 being phased out i will be selecting solely on price Either way you cant go wrong as DAddario makes a fine product at a reasonable price Another fine DAddario product,positive

This is the best tuner Ive used in over a decade of playing various instruments The design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on Overall ease of tuning and ability to do so in a noisy environment are well worth the 14 I paidI like the ability to change the overall tuning to different standards eg Baroque or NY Philharmonic and the included metronome is also nice to have Perhaps the most useful feature is that this unit will tune any note guitar players can spot check a fretted tone and other musicians can tune to C or another preferred note that some guitar tuners do not haveMine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit There is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke Glue and a rubber band now holds it together I mention this so that you wont put yours in a tight exterior pocket on a gig bag or otherwise smash it into a broken state A highly valued tuner,positive
Its affordable and it works Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input Its Affordable and it works,positive
These really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars DAddarios are the best and I love the ball end color coding No guessing or searching for the vernier caliper to make sure the right string is on the right tunerThis coding system is consistent thru all their string sets Cant beat this My favorite for acoustic guitar,positive

Until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders Then the Zoom H2 came along and numerous variations on a theme were soon to follow Ive owned both the H2 and the H1 and though both have their strong points the Tascam DR05 has served me better than either The H2 has pleasing 4point sound and the H1 at half the size of the Tascam works well for stealth as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera But both recorders are more complicated than necessary with tricky menu systems excessive tiny buttons 6 on one thin side of the H1 and dicey build qualityThe Tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine thats a pleasure to use There are no shaky rattling parts the controls are solid and instantly solved easily manageable with a single thumb and the widespread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music for dictation I use a separate small mic inserted in the topside input The machine reminds me of the far costlier Sony PCM50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation The Tascams 320 kbps MP3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically present than its 9624 WAV files and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum If you dont have 500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for dayin dayout use this is the one Unbeatable value convenience and durability,positive
Manufacturers website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar I have an ESP Eclipse Not even close ChromaCast products are great They need to fix the info on their web page Im not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases Too bad Does NOT fit a Les PaulESP Eclipse shaped guitar their site says it does,negative
I own several tube amp combo and halfstack However I wanted a smaller lighter combo that would be easy to transport and wouldnt need any pedals but would also be loud enough to practice with a drummer The line 6 spider IV 75watt combo was the perfect solution Up to this point I havent been very impressed by solidstate technology Sure the cleans are glassy and crystalclear and some sound ok with the gain cranked and mids scooped at super low volume but as soon as you turn up the volume a bit or try to dial in a smooth bluesy overdrive the sound turns to crap Not so with the spider IV Ive been extremely impressed with all the different amp models ALL of them The different amp models each have their unique sound and characteristics which means that your tonal options are literally limitless I play mostly metal and hard rock thougn I use less gain and more mids than is typical among players of the genreId describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge And I was able to get that tone in less than a minute of fiddling The tone in general is surprisingly warm and organic very tubelike which is a comparison that I dont make lightly Additionally the highs dont have that artificial tinny sound that so often occurs in solidstate Solos and leads have more of the natural smooth quality that tube amps are valued forThe effects are fun to play with though Ive never used many effects in my playing I really like having multiple user presets so I can dial in the tones that I use the most and then switch between them at the press of a button The artist presets are cool its interesting to see Line 6s take on the sound of many popular bands and songs Some are surprisingly good like Cliffs of Dover Master of Puppets and Sunshine of Your Love while others dont really sound like the artist like Killswitch EngageIm also impressed with the quality of the celestion speaker that comes with the amp it holds up pretty well even at higher volumes The tone has continually improved as Ive broken in the speakerJust in conclusion theres basically nothing this amp cant do at least fairly well All the amp models actually sound good cant say the same about my roland cube and when you combine that with all the effects tuner mp3 connection and user and song artist presets its a winning combination This will never be my main stage amp but for practice purposes I couldnt be more pleased with the spider IVedited to add A few months later I bought the FBV express pedal board Its a simple affordable way to get more out of the amp by making channel switching easy and adding a volumewah pedal Especially if this is your main amp I recommend getting a FBV pedal to go with it The best sound solidstate technology has to offer,positive
Ive been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7yearold because he wants to play guitar like daddy does For 100 its an OK starter guitar for a kid and I guess really short people who cant play a regular Fender but not something Id recommend to anyone else And my kid thinks it looks cool so hell be more likely to stick with itEven though it has a laminated body the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed Its light and easy to handle The hardware isnt bad with a stable bridge good idea not to put a floating trem in this 5way blade switch solid jack and strap anchors and smooth knobs The pickups are not top notch but work well enough a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does so Im not complaining It has a nice red paint jobOn the down side besides some sharp fret ends it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings It has one small pit in the red finish It has no paperwork or owners manual The tuners are kind of choppy And the bodyneck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tuneIt comes strung with Fender 9s which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down so its good for a kid just starting out I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound But as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better OK starter guitar for a kid,neutral
Many reviews cover the pros of this item so Ill be short only to add that they are very sturdy when install properlysuggestion find a wall stud and use 3 screws for heavier instrumentsUsed in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strats Havent had an issue with any in the 45 months weve had them up On the electrics we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cableThe hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slippingWonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free Own 4 they are sturdy and adaptable,positive

Works really well was a great price and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time The capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar A Capo that is worth the time and effort to have great guitar sounds very convenient and easy to handle,positive
I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC33 Acoustic Amp The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate This is totally unnecessary for a footswitch The worst part is the leads on the battery connector 9 volt were not properly soldered or had shorted out The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed ie all that has to work are two switches and a battery you would think that Boss would put out a better product I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site Absolute Junk,negative
This works very good on a silver flute Its soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it Would purchase again Works good on Silver flute,positive
I use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out Individual volumes controls make it perfect Just what I needed,positive
I had one of these and lost it replaced it with the NS Planet Waves micro clip on tuner which is not as good This tuner has a better higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs It works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too Easily worth the extra dollar Its a little taller than the micro but still very small and if its behind a headstock it doesnt make a difference visually the main difference is the height if the tuner width and depth are about the same That also means a bigger readout So not really a con I use it on a godin with a slotted headstock positioned so I can see it between the tuning keys Easy to use bummed I lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner Ill be getting another one of these soon Should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it Perfect for me better than NS design micro tuner,positive
I use this with my Audio Technica condensor Works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings Its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain Its not bulky which is a nice Great little extra power source for condensor,positive
These stay connected but arent so wide that they change the style of picking I like them and so does my music teacher We try to stay stocked in these picks Great lil picks,positive
Update We received a replacement for this item It does everything it was advertised to do and it performs quite well although the clip on the new one doesnt grip as well as the first The device tunes within 610ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner Our thanks to DAddario for their assistance in satisfying this customerPlease check our reviews We review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about productsUnfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device Our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready We have several NS1 models that work flawlessly as well as TG200 models that we really likeThis one seems to consume coincell batteries at an unacceptable rate On average it eats a battery a day It also has a much darker display making it hard to read unless the stage is quite dark One would think that if the display were darker less power would be drawn from the battery Average room lighting is too bright to use this tunerWe do like the ability to rotate the display so that the tuner can be mounted in front or behind the headstock with the display maintaining proper orientation Unfortunately the poor performance means that this unit will find its way into the junkdrawer on the workbench Update to Maybe its just this version of the DAddario micro tuner,positive
Bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from It does the job Nothing at all fancy about this strap Two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide Will do the job until you find the one of your dreams Most basic of basic guitar straps,neutral

You know I love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps I own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars I no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while Im playing That prevents a lot of damage Like the locks,positive
I had fairly low expectation for a 25 pedal but many people said it sounded very close if not better than a vintage Boss VB2 Considering I didnt want to spend 20x this pedal I cant compare the 2 but can say it works very well It can do subtle lowrate lowdepth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles The rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control or at least turning it up weakens the effect which I guess is good I might swap around the leads Finally a nonblue LED is used which means it wont blind you when you try to adjust the settingsBeing 25 however the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even Behringers 50 pedal and the hinge is a little less stable It will still hold up with moderate use However it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature which is a momentary mode Awesome sonic possibilities,positive
Ive been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip the right string resonance for strumming and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest Ive found so far for my style of playing Im a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely strum more softly and still get enough clarity and volume I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking theyre very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal Worth a try,positive

Well made proven over decades Switched from NS capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck Not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement Requires less adjustment Square pad allows placement right next to the fret Easy to adjust with a bit of practiceI enjoy using quality machined parts so this is a pleasure plus it is built to last Light weight solid effective,positive
This product did not fit my Takamine G as the hole is 34 size I had to buy from Lute Hole who then customized a part for me Beware because youd figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there given the advertising Even the guy at Guitar Center when I called to find out what was going on told me to go with Lute Hole I never had a use for such an item before very recently but upon necessity I found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar even if it does fit Be very very careful In fact be very very wary as I briefly heard a light cracking noise when I tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time I stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the Gs specs Ive read elsewhere that it kills your tone but I had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig Ultimately I spent nearly 100 more than I wanted to just for this kind of item What is it they say in this era caveat emptor Only fits certain guitars,neutral

As the title it works the way its supposed to But I wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it wont move easily Nevertheless its a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground Just remember use some common sense dont expect the guitar to totally stable works like its supposed to,positive
Scratch free durable machine washable I use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much much longer You place the cloth next to a string then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces sides and top of the string then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times then repeat on the remaining strings I then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys Takes a matter of moments and works great Then once every week or two it just goes in with the laundry comes out perfectly clean againPolyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric It is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface but it works well for polishing If Im using carnuba wax I use a 100 cotton towel to remove it but for dry polishing wouldnt be without one for each guitar Works great,positive
The M48 is well built sturdy and well balanced enough that I have no concerns about tipping even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music The tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort Once in place it stays there with no slipping For all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small carThis is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives and I always have some concern that it will not be what I want when I get it in this case it is a winner Delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed Just right,positive
These cords seem to be a hair longer than the conventional pedaltopedal cords which is nice They also seem to be quality without bulky Some quality cords Ive purchased in the past were stiff and bulky when I needed more flexibility These cords strike that balance perfectlyQuality and value so you cant go wrongUPDATEIve lowered my 4 star rating down to 3 Over time about half of these cords have developed a problem of coming unplugged from the pedal they plugged into and this seems to be a unique problem with just these cords About half have worked great the other half have this odd little issue Nice addition to my pedal board,neutral

These DAddario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking A couple of notes though 1 on the positive side they are made in the USA of Americanproduced materials unlike silk and steel strings by a famous American guitar company whose name starts with M which are assembled south of the border 2 on the negative side they cost more than Ms silk and steel strings 3 in general silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings especially more than flatwound acoustic strings 4 the tone is very nice and mellow sort of a cross between flatwound steel strings and nylon strings 5 the DAddario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion 6 they really work best for finger picking whatever you do dont use metal finger picks and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking Great Strings for FingerPicking,positive

I bought this to tote my POD HD500 around It fits snugly but well The accessory pocket can fit the power supply and the plastic Line 6 expression pedal The shoulder strap makes me feel important it respects my arms desire for freedom of movement My only qualm is that its Gator brand and gators remind me Florida Id rather just pretend that Florida didnt exist Perfect for the POD HD500,positive

Well I guess it works I dont know what I was expecting I was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar I had to tie the other end around the guitar area but I dont know I guess it is okay it doesnt really bother me it is just that I wasnt expecting it Also the actual band where I can put around my body is not THAT comfortable but it is okay and I can move around in it and secure it to my body It is OK because not very comfortable,neutral

Im surprised that the maker of Amazons popular AT2020 would go this low The mic imo is fullyvalued even at its singledigit price Its dynamic rather than condenser but it still requires loads of power to get it up to workable levels phantom power which is a requirement for condenser mics would probably not add sufficient heft Its very lightweight and with its optional plug and onoff switch is versatile enough The quality of the sound moreover isnt badproviding you can hear it Be prepared to have plenty of watts on hand to coax any appreciable sensitivity from this nonresponsive creature I havent tested it for recording purposes Despite appearances this mic is no bargain Suitable only for backup,neutral

Wow I am very surprised by this pedal I got it with the intention of going aft that chimey AC30 tone which it does a decent job at I didnt realize everything else this pedal can do You can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem Metal no problem crystal clear and punchy no problem super crispy tele twang no problemI tried it on bass and was REALLY impressed It is eerily similar in function to my SANSAMP VT BASS pedal and gets a lovely SVT type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end I even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added ODCrunch in front of both my headcab as well as VT BASS and PARA DRIVER Works like a charmTurn the VOICE control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy while adding a bit of mid range responseI only wish this had a balanced XLR out in addition to the normal 1434 out Phantom Power would be nice then alsoI would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there I have been thinking of trying the Joyo DI wit speaker simulation for this purpose but I just havent gotten around to buying it yetIn my opinion you should at least check this thing out I mean its 40 Holy Crap,positive
Ive tried pretty much every harp out there after having played the regional blues jazz circuit for about 10 years Lee Oskar harps are the best valueOn top of it Lee Oskar actually called me once just because I left a question on his websiteIve met Rick Epping of Hohner harmonicas at NAMM great guy but he never called me at 330 in the afternoon just because I could not identify a song I thought he was playing onI carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig so that is at least 290 for a set of Lee Oksar harps10 Suzuki Manji harps while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great would cost nearly 480 presuming you could find themI will not say Ive never blown a reed on a LO but I will say that 22 for a new set of LO reed plates beats 48 for a new Manji at least in my bookOn top of it all they really did with the Manji is discontinue the Bushman Delta Frost harmonicas and rename them so they could double the priceLee Oskar harmonicas are inexpensive they are simple and cheap to repair easy to play have great tone and are even easy to identify since the 1st 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb That feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yetGive them a shot 10 years as a semipro and I keep coming back to these,positive
Hello Musicfriends This is built cheap but sounds great Good controls too For me in the studiosongwriting its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it There is something about the knobs I still love even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it may be the age thing Built cheap Sounds great,positive

These strings are good Nice tone last a decent amount of time and theyre cheap Color coded ballends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention I use these on all my electric guitars now where before I used Dean Markley 1152 mostly Les Paul scale I moved to these when I got a stratscale guitar I dont remember why I picked these other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere where Dean Markley can be hit or miss Good strings Great Price,positive

I once bought a guitar case that came with a variety pack from light to heavy of Planet Waves picks Since then Ive used nothing elseIve found that the light picks 50mm are perfect for me These obviously dont last as long as thicker picks but still last a very long time and they suit my playing style and the type of music I play better The picks are comfortable to hold and are attractively designed in a faux motherofpearl style Ill definitely continue to buy this brand in the future Durable and attractive,positive
Strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost Clean well packaged Has adjustment for length the hole size is per very good will take some working to get it on the guitar so you need not worry about slipping off I will still use a strap lock Nice product I suggest it Good Value,positive
Purchased this to replace a Behringer pedal because the Behringer introduced a swishing sound This pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless Good product and got good price here on Amazon DigiTech XDV DigiVerb Digital Reverb Pedal,positive
A little patients sanding the saddle to fit my 1973 vintage Guild better fit than the plastic original that it replaced and the sound expanded beyond my expectations I also replaced the bridge pins with Tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone Nice sound upgrade for your guitar,positive
Great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered Fits a standard Xstand just fine and makes a very secure connection Nice,positive
for the price you cant really beat this little amp the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up the little speaker gets kinda muddy but for a bright clean tone it works well the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gainthe headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes but for the money its a great buy great little practice amp for late nights,positive

This was a great purchase A bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar Good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them Great price and purchase Legacy Pearloid Guitar Picks 60 Assorted 46MM15MM,positive

A friend of mine has used this stand for over a year and I ordered mine due to the quality and durability I saw with hers Much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one I had before A little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner Excellent portable unit,positive
Whats most impressive isnt the topdrawer leather and craftsmanship that goes without saying from Levys its the clever design the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap adjusts to almost any position and adjusts to almost any small wireless transmitter transmitter not receiver usual immaculate Levys quality but since when is it a receiver holder,positive

I am impressed with daddarios electric strings Easy to adjust to very light on my fingers and theyre built to last With a few adjustments to my amp settings these strings are very dynamic in their tone quality from classic to hard rock styles Any guitarist who plays electric can enjoy these strings and they last a long time too Good all around quality strings,positive
Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used they sound great and last far longer tonally than anything else I have tried Best Strings I have ever used,positive
Based upon some of the other reviews I feel I got a different product as it didnt fit the descriptions given by others I ordered two of these and both were very thin material not sturdy at all Second both straps were not adjustable to 5934 Both mine measured 4534 from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended They are useless to me as my guitar a dreadnought covers the middle of my chest when I put it on I believe I was given a substitute product since when I ordered these straps the price was just 100 and now theyre back up to 495 as I write this Im really sick of these Amazon substitutions For what I paid I wont bother returning themnot worth the hassle I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars Very disappointed Warningif you see a price drop below 495 dont buyits probably not the product thats described here Very very disappointed,negative
I play a Cordoba Classical and these strings are the best Ive found for it The bass strings really resound all strings stretch and hold within three days and they last longer than Ive expected for classical strings Ive not yet had a broken string with them Strong Longlasting,positive
this tuner is easy to use I like that it has the input jack for electric guitar as well as acoustic It makes it so much easier this is my first tuner in a long time and Im please with it easy to use tuner,positive
This product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the Akai Pro website Technical support is also almost zero Akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products Customer service is basically If you have to ask you should not buy this I asked the Akai technical department which sequencer software I needed and they told me to go to a Music store This may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of MIDI knowledge and experience dont buy this product Try finding a MIDI tutorial that is usable Good luck with that choreAdded 08Nov2010 The keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing I sent an email to Akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts I find that unbelievable Requires indepth MIDI knowledge Akai does not care about customers,negative
Great picks for beginners and pros alike Go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing Good all rounder,positive
I thought I would throw my twocents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifierAfter making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas especially the body where it is needed the mostEven though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these I actually bought three of themI crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and AC in the summer keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet The humidity drops quite low but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to rewet them lolTwo great tips in oneUse a regular more dense sponge thicker like the ones at the dollar store Cut them to size and stuff them inThrow away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and dont worry about distilled water unless you want to I cant argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size and toss them away without any regard when needing replacedDont worry about the 34thing34 hanging inbetween your strings It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge too saturated and it leaks I will either squeeze the excess water out or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it wont dripThe humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundholeIf you ARE rough careless thoughtless or stupid you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could causeThe top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover The sponge inside is quite small and there isnt too much room for a much larger sponge The device is simple and fairly solid Treat it gently and it will last forever You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills Im sure it would be a decade before anything 34built up34 to require extensive cleaning or replacementKeep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be rewetting the spongeTry to keep the sponge moist when its dryI strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier or similar mini sized about 134 X 434 costing around 1720 bucksThis will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument caseRemember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp Too dry and it will shrink and crack split the soundboard top also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasiveIf you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold andor dry you would be negligent if not careless to spend the pittance to make sure your baby aint thirsty or worsedead brokenHope this helps Works Fine Much Better Than Nothing,positive
I have not tested other micro amps this does for what I bought it for to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport its very portable to take with you I really like the overdrive sound the tuner works really well I dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel but overall its a great product so if you need a good tone and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try its great I very good amp,positive
I bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my Fender acoustic These are easy to install using the instructions or without These are also sturdy and look very good Great looking and Easy to Install,positive
This chromatic clipon tuner is the best of the best One cannot go without having one for the price Ive tuned violins guitars and ukeleles with it This is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without You can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments If you have it on the MIC than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wishThis little instrument tuner does everything FOR THE COST YOU JUST CANNOT BE WITHOUT ONE The Best of The Best,positive
The tuner doesnt require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it so it will work pretty well in a noisysocial environment Overall works just fine Works just fine,positive
Theres not much to say about this pick I like medium picks and this feels comfortableThey wear a bit faster than I would expect but far rom being a problem It may just be my styleThe 12pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity Good picks,positive
Anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing The tonal qualities weight feel materials and all other qualities variables combine to make strings your very own personal favorite For me these strings bring it all together and are my string of choice for all 12 acoustic electrics I use to play what I consider rock ballads using my strummingstyle of playI love the feel and tone of these strings for my style of play and my equipment setup I do have some issues with these strings but overall Im willing to put up with the issues for the overall performance I get from the EJ26 strings The issues include what I think may be premature breakage I do not play 34hard34 I play long playing several hours daily but I play rock ballads using a somewhat softer strumming style I definitely do not 34pound34 on the strings I like to think of it as fairly 34gentle34 strumming Yet I seem to manage to break the high E B strings on a regular basis by playing not by over tuning Some of this can be expected but what bothers me is the frequency with which Im breaking G strings I simply dont think these wound Gs should be breaking at all with my style of playing Ive noticed that the current 34most helpful critical review34 mentions this same problem I change strings frequently so I dont think this is the reason they are breakingOverall I am willing to putup with what I believe to be some premature breakage especially with the G string for the other qualities that draw me to the EJ26 strings They sound great for my style of play equipment and setup They feel great I love em and will continue to buy quantities of them for my 12 acoustic electrics I just wish I had a better feeling about the premature breakage My Preference in Strings,positive
I love this system Every time I change strings now I go through every step of this system and what a difference it has made The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great I never realized how dry the wood was The string cleaner is nice too I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this The quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear The two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable Great System,positive
Great polishing cloth Not much to say here other than it works and works well Removes all the fingerprints and polishes my baby up like new after each practice or gig Cant go wrong Clean and Shiny,positive
Ive reviewed several Joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of themnot just because of the price 40 to 50 but also because of their apparent durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price But ultimately I decided that this is somewhere between a 4 and 5 review and I just cant give it the 5 review Ive given the other Joyo products Ive tried out thus far Extremely high output and high sustain When I first plugged this thing in I had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal I would try out with my Les Paul and VOX combo amp with the dials all at 12 oclock 50 Big mistake This pedal has an EXTREMELY high output Depending on the Gain setting I was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the Volume set at around 25 This isnt necessarily a bad thing and its certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder a frequent criticism of the BOSS DS1 but its something to be aware ofAlso I read several comments here that this isnt a high gain distortion I couldnt disagree more This thing has TONS of gain I think people are thrown off by two things 1 The name which pays tribute to the MI Audio Crunchbox it clones and 2 The claritytransparency of the tone particularly the higherend range that shines through at all Gain levels Crunch in my mind refers to a punchy cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character The Crunch Distortion has a tone that doesnt really breakup or get fizzy as you turn up the Gain but thats not what Gain really is The Gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the notes but I think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesnt crack up Hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up This actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work also which is one of the JF03s strengths The setup is weird but workable Because of everything I described above you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want My level is usually around 25 to 40 and is still very loud The crunchy classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist but only at around 5 to 15 of the gain setting And I had the tone knob generally working from 9 o clock to 12 oclock as it got a little too bright to go any higher Again this is with Les Paul humbuckers Ultimately what I decided was that this pedal has enough bass not too much in the midrange and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly If you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments Id imagine this pedal would do the trick Its costs less than half of many of its true competitors While the affordability aspect is distinct from quality it cannot be ignored Part of my initial disappointment was based on a sidebyside comparison with my MXR 78 Custom Badass Distortion The latter did have a fuller sound to it and was arguably better for rhythm work But thats an 80 custom shop pedal from MXR Try comparing this pedal to a 40 Boss DS1 or MXR Distortion and it blows them out of the water in my opinion Im not sure want to roll with the Crunch Distortion being the only dirt box on my board but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind like a leadgain boost you could afford this and Joyos excellent Ultimate Drive overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even BOSS distortion pedals go forUPDATE About a week into owning this pedal I did revise this score from a 5 to a 4 rating If you graded the pedal in a vacuum I could absolutely see a 5 rating for the 40 price tag But ultimately there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that I havent had with other Joyo products so the score should reflect that Please note also which I didnt realize before that the internal trim pot for presence is NOT easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it A distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment and I have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything Extremely high output distortion pedal great value for singing lead tones and endless sustain,positive
This is a great little amp especially for the money Its all tube has a power attenuator headphone out and reverb all for under 200 CRAZY Its built extremely well and has some weight to it but youd have no problem carrying it to a small gig A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD so the attenuator is a godsendHow does it sound you ask Tone is subjective but to my ears it can get quite Marshally without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele I dont own a Strat so I cant comment on single coils through it On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good Back In Black style hard rock tone If you want to play Metal youre going to need a distortionoverdrive pedal Ive found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy The headphone out isnt great its good enough for practice but dont try to use it as a line out for recordingIve done some recording using a 57 onaxis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center When stacking 34 tracks especially using different guitars I got a HUGE Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzyI havent swapped tubes or the speaker its completely stock I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it but the stock tone is just fine as it is The stock speaker is an 8 Bugera vintage think greenback clone and it is darker than a lot of small speakers A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJs or GTs but it all depends on what youre after for toneA lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it Bugera is made by Beringer but I found this amp to be very good quality especially given that it was made in ChinaI would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap Its an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily Good stuff Bugera V5 5Watt Guitar Amp,positive
This is a very high quality strap The supple leather is excellent as is the workmanshipHowever I dont like the plastic end pieces They are large and well plastic So Im sending it backIm going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapProtec Guitar Strap with Leather Ends and Pick Pocket Blackand straplocksSchaller Security Locks Nickelfor about the same priceThis is mainly a matter of personal preference If you dont mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap Very Nice Strap But Not For Me,neutral
THis is a 5 star stand considering the price Sure its not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what its supposed to do without any problems I dont forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough Its a music stand so I dont see how it would take a lot of abuse Good for the price,positive
My partner wont put a pickup in his guitar and I get tires of luggin an amp around along with the rest of the sys so this does the trick Clip on the boom stand stick a SM 57 on it and an SM 58 to sing in and your set Holds tight Fits the bill,positive

For an 8 item you cant go wrong I used it on a violin to test out some amps at a Guitar Center It seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone Seems to work ok,positive
How do you review an SM58 Ive used these most of my life and will continue to Very durable I got this to replace the same a 20 year old rusted dented grill 58 I also use a D5 AKG same price and a line 6 wirelesss but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup standard,positive
They add depth to your bass drum by muffling the overtones a bit and it is the pads that wear out rather than your bass drum head so these actually save you money and sound better Ive used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar Yea if you play double pedal you want these or similar,positive
Heres what strap locks are supposed to do securely attach your strap to your guitar These do that much better than Schallers and the Fender ripoffs of SchallerI used the Schallers many years ago They look great but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut I am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc but at one gig with my super heavy American deluxe 5 string jazz bass the nut worked its way off the strap and I dropped it It was with a heavy leather strap and I did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and Im sure I kept it maintained Absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable Never again Unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig forget about Schallers Theyre a good company and they make great tuners I dont fault the materials its simply that threaded things can work their way loose a fatal design flaw for this type of device Come on its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something elseThe Dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring It is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident If youre having trouble getting the lockrings on I have a YouTube video posted to my channel NickWeissMusic just search for Dunlop strap lock installation Its kind of tough at first but with experience its very easy The package instructions are correct but not very helpfulI have these on more than 10 instruments and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade The package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock but I have never done so in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this Ive never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks if I did Id probably just replace it I do give the locks a little tug when I put them on to make sure theyre engaged other than that you can forget about them which is the way it should beThe only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the Schallers do to which I say who cares Well I guess a lot of people care about that since I see it in a lot of reviews If using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar so be it I have seen Ernie Ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile I think they use lock rings too Maybe try those but Im sticking with the flawless track record of the Dunlops The best value work perfectly,positive
I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body People watching me cant really see it and its right where I need it full of picks if I drop one Wonderful little invention Buy it if you dont want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket Stays on my guitar,positive

Ive only used the string winder so far but it works well so far I use it on my guitars and my banjo The other things look like they will work well but I havent used them yet so I cant say for sure If not then Ill update this review if I can Well the string winder is good,positive
Ive had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos What the hell Anyway this capo works well Ive only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics and it does a fine job Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off but it does not affect the capoabilities Im sure there are better ones but for me this works well Works like it should,positive
I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars Therefore after playing I always wipe down my strings to extend their life Ive used other microfiber cloths but they tend to break easy and leave fuzzies on the strings which I then have to remove one by one This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use I liked my first one so much that I am putting in another order Great For Wiping Strings After Use With No Fuzzies,positive
These DAddario EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light strings for acoustic guitars produce decent sound and are designed to last longer than normal strings We have two beginner guitar players in the house and we are very hard on strings so these are a good choice for usWe are very pleased with the way they sound feel and last so will likely pick up these again the next time we need to replace the stringsRecommendedCFH Good For New Player Recommended,positive
I actually forgot that I bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick Its not a bad pick I will continue to use them but I wish they had a softer center or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers Not sticky enough,neutral

Whatever the name this pedal is from the Ibanez Tube Screamer camp The packaging description says it uses the JRC4558 chip and MA150 diodes and yes Behringer got the sound right Id say this competes well against any of the modded TS pedals What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob For the TS pedals in this price range its the most useful You can set it high and it isnt too icepicky yet the entire range is useful This is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive soundI prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal or another overdrive It works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones It could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tonesI bought this pedal to semiretire an older Ibanez TS5 soundtank The switch on that one isnt as good as the Behringers The Behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off I use mainly solid state Fender amps and several distortion pedals including a BOSS Metal Zone Id bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt The only downside is the slight lack of bass If you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups esp 2x12 and 4x12 or a distorted tone with plenty of bass this shouldnt be a problem Vintage More like Classic,positive
love these strings but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball they just sound better bend easier and have a longer life span but Martin are very good too I just prefer Ernie Ball but they were sold out and I needed strings fast great strings but ernie ball are better,positive
Just got three of these in today and compared one to a used Fender standard one strap bag I also got in at the same timeThe Chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the Fender does not go thisextra step The Chromacast also has many more pocketsThe specs on the Fender and Chromacast do not back up reality as the Fender advertizes 12mm padding and the Chromacast advertizes 10mm padding Someone is not telling the truth here and I think it is FenderThis is a good medium class gig bag that falls somewhere in between a dust bag like the Burswood and a Deluxe 2022mm padded bagThe only thing the bag is missing is a hanger on the back which the Fender does haveChromacast should get rid of the plastic expensive hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone elseThis bag is good for in house and light use no throwing it around transportIf you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard caseAt 2000 this bag is a steal Better than the Fender standard Best price point,positive
Good quality seem durable enough Sure there are better cables out there but for the price these are hard to beat Works great priced right,positive
One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldnt handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didnt have much to lose with a 7 price tag I was very glad I made the purchase and Im going to order a couple more of this model and the 13 model Its steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place Its solidly built and I dont imagine it will break easily The two pieces that move against each other have teeth so once the angle is set and the knob tightened it will not slip Get the 13 if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand 7 is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length On Stage 6112 Mini Boom Arm,positive
For Macs but fyi it goes out after 45mn and just need to be unplugged and back in Not a big deal Works well,neutral
Hey it gets the job done and thats all I can ask for I tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all While some had better casings metal instead of plastic at the end of the day Im looking for a good sound not a pretty pedal board The pedal seems solid enough it doesnt take up much space it sounds great and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals comeAND if you are like the typical musician you are looking for something thats not going to break the bank Gets the job done,positive
These are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were This is exactly what I wanted since my 1973 acoustic guitar has been restrung so many times that the bridge pin holes were getting loose enough that the original plastic pins were very low and difficult to grab and pull out These new pins fit those holes perfectly and make stringing my guitar a pleasure again And there is also a noticeable improvement in the sound over that produced by the plastic pins Perfect upgrade for vintage guitars with loose bridge pins,positive
Very close to the sound of an SM58 Not quite as 34warm34 as the Shure but this mic has the best sound for the price Im very impressed Great Mic,positive
Ive used my HDE pickup for about a month now I use it with a Fender Frontman amp The sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost I highly recommend this product Ill probably get a second one for a backup while I can get it at the present price Excellent Pickup,positive
I found the price on Amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it The slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acousticelectric guitar and also sounds great with a Cigar Box Guitar with piezo pickup The slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle ring and pinky fingerI found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better IMO I have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar but a Dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchaseJim Dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and I think this one will last a long time Nice slide for acoustic and cigar box guitar,positive
I installed these on a Silvertone SD10 which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar They are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory If you are looking for a regularmedium string these are real nice Great product Great Acoustic Strings,positive
Well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a parthowever as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming onHowever I am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming oneI bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songsand it is a NIGHTMAREGoing on a week now no support help from either companyHEED MY WARNING IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS WITH NI EZ DRUMMER OR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO REROUTE MAPPING OF MIDI IN ORDER TO USE IT This is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with softwareThere is very little helpful info out on the net ive owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone itemthere really is no MIDI supportIm am close to giving up the fight and sending it backAlesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software Good stand alonenightmare for recording or software use,negative
I didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted 34vintage34 for my 34relicd34 build Clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on Amazon But no worries Amazon sells adapters to make the 34large34 holes in the neck fit the 34smaller34 vintage tuning key posts1 star off for not looking like the higest quality Im happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price Just pay attention to vintage,positive
even a kid can use it with a guitar I received 2 in a kool metallicblue but as far as I know you cant choose the color and it is bad because a match with the instrument is koolMy perplexity this is why the 4 stars is generally on electronic tuning it happened to me that different brands gave a slight different tune while all should be perfect and perfectly the same creepy isnt itWhat we do now I do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune better go back to the diapason its kool easy and,positive
I still had the original strings on an Epiphone LP100 guitar I bought last November I know thats bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming It was nice to get these through Vine and try them outThere is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on It sounds cleaner and brighterI wish Id changed the strings when I first started learning to play because these are much easier to play Now its not much of an issue but it would have made a difference when I was breaking in my fingers those many months agoI would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive Nice Sound,positive
This stand works fine if you dont need a shock mount The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2A mic on a shock mount The low height 4 12 which would otherwise help stabilize the mic left too little clearance between the mic and desktop If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic youre better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand BlackBTW my copy of this stand also did not have the 38 inch male thread Works fine but too low for a shock mounted mic,positive
The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever againThey do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required Works but had to ruin a strap for everything else,neutral
I like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar And it looks good Overall I recommend Pretty and works nicely,positive
On my mixer I have sendreturns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip return on the ring and a common ground But my effects boxes like to have separate 14 TR ins and outsThis is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202vlZ3s sendreturnsMackie 1202VLZ3 12Ch Compact RecordingSR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a sendreturn I needed this for returns,positive
It is a nice cable for the money seams to be made well Looks like it is holding up so far cable,positive
So you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing This strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job wellThe materials are 1high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a nonstretch ACE bandage 2 durable nonscratchingmarring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3 a thick rubber material for the endsThe thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well They do not slide of the strap pegs very easily I say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility Again this material seems to be nonmarringAll this and a secret compartment for picksOverall a fantastic product with a price that cant be beat Highly recommended Five stars Inexpensive functional and 5 star,positive
For a cheap pedal I gave this a try Very versitle Can get many different types of sounds and drive from it The knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough I guess I like much more than the Joyo fuzz THis can give some cleans and drive to distortion You really need to work with it a bit with your amp and find that sweet spotCertainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal I have used But for the budget I do receomend it It is cheap and very has a good range of tone options I ran it into a Fender Camp 600 and they seemed to get along wellHope this helps Surprised,positive
Ive used electronic tuners for a long time Most of them that Ive owned you have to plug into your instrument That means they dont tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument I bought a Korg GA30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago I used that Korg until getting the Snark The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasnt lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in its dayEnter the Snark SN2 This Snark will tune about anything It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or dont clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone Clip it to a music stand clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar upright bass violin saxophone trumpet or even a tympani Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to It senses the entire scaleThe Snark SN2 has a well lit clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness The display pivots to any angle It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock The battery seems to last a fairly long time longer than the 9Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per monthLong term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clipon tuners Ive only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile Ive had no issues at all yet and it still works good I dont think you should drop it very often So far Ive dropped mine once with no damage Even if it did break 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurateWhile long term durability is undecided I cant complain at all about the versatility accuracy high visibility display or the low cost I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar It really gets around and tunes them all The color is sort of a metallic red almost Candy Apple Red I ordered spare batteries but havent needed to change one yetId buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that doesnt have one Im sure theyll use it often This tuner is a real good buy at a good price Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so youll be preparedIve never used the metronome feature other than to check it out It flashed a locked tempo but I really dont need that feature Amazingly Versatile Little Doohickey,positive
There is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these I have several Came in perfect working condition Great Buy A Must Have,positive
Well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hoursIts exactly what you would expect from Behringer it worksits not great but it gets the job done i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but its still pretty useful for less than 25I dont regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withDanelectro D8 Fab 600Ms Delaywell maybe next timeI give it a 3 out of 5 it wasnt this time Behringer surprised me Exactly what you would expect from Behringer,neutral
I played the Wedding March at my sons outdoor wedding back in April and I needed an amp so folks would be able to hear me I plugged in my Martin HD28 and all went well The Martin has an Fishman Infinity Pickup narrow style in it and together with the pickup this amp put out a real sweet sound As I said the wedding was outdoors and everyone complimented me on the Wedding March so I know they heard me and I didnt even have to crank up the volumeIn my den when I practiced I barely raised the volume else it would have been WAY too loud So in short Id buy it again Sweet,positive
I really didnt expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is Its tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts Its not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap but it serves its purpose well feels sturdy enough and its adjustable for a man of any size I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd no complaints here If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20 or 30 on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine for 6 you cant beat it buy one or 2 nothing to lose here A Basic Guitar Strap Does What Its Designed To Do,positive
I usually dont buy many guitar straps and when I do I like to get a thick leathertype one because Ive found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while and I dont like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments I bought the black version I think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over so I probably wont worry about running colors but I will keep an eye out for such a thing Its very adjustable just not quickly adjustable worked perfectly with my Straplocks and keeps my 45 pound it seems like it anyway Les Paul from digging into my shoulder The 25 inch width is fine for me but if youre spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster Id go up to the 3 inch model especially if youre going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours Great strap will have for a long time,positive
For the money this is one of the best products Ive reviewed I went ahead and ordered two and before I even had a chance to buy them the price dropped by a dollar or so They easily fit on your mic stand and save you the hassle of trying to bend over and find your pick once you drop it Definitely a smart buy Dont play another show without these Conveniet affordablePerfect,positive
I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon Vine review program I was excited to receive them as Ive looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and professional grade designationIm not an audiophile nor am I snob about audio devices Any brand that works well at the right price Ill buy it That being said Ive recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones with theBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones Blackbeing the most recentObviously the Bose beat the TASCAM ones so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that sound wise you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range These TASCAM TH2000R Professional Grade Headphones dont sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges Bass is great but even when tweaking the equalizer settings I never could find the clarity I was seeking in the full rangeI listened to several genres Classical Blues Pop Rock Electronic Country and Latino with these headphones Each time the quality was good but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iPhone PC andYamaha RXV675 72 Channel Network 3D AV Receiver with Airplay BlackThe fit of the headphones is big for me Usually they are too small Having them as small as I could make them top of my head to ears the cups still dropped down a bit lower than I liked I had to hold them in place to get a solid fit The padding underneath the headpiece is minimal and after about 15 minutes of use the top of my head hurtThe build quality of these phones appears to be excellent The cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6 The screw on adapter 1835mm to 1463mm allows for use with multiple devices stereo components and sound boards The foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not muchThese headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass Great for those who want the chunky headset look are on the go DJing andor have larger headsThey are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening Theyre also not for those with smaller heads Lacking mid and high range with large fit,neutral
The ukulele is very cool looking it plays nice it doesnt sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele it comes with cheap strings but its a very fun ukulele I think its worth a hundred dollars A HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF FUN,positive
This pedal board replaced a bcb6 boss case because I have a lot of nonBoss pedals and wanted to start using them for gigsThe PT2 footprint is large enough to accommodate a lot of pedals but not too big for a smaller gig except some of the smallest stages room corners that do require a smaller rigWithout going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case I wrote the company described the problem Lizzie wrote back and said shed take care of it You just dont get better service than this company provides Combine that with the great product design and Im a happy customerThe larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath This is one of its best features Truly plug and play Yes I spent more than I ever have on a pedal board before Portability Reliability Flexibility If I was ever going to use my best pedals for gigs this was itI have tried SKB and Furman and they have some nice features if you like a lot of plastic I still like the PT2 much better Awesome customer service,positive
Excellent Product it is well cushioned Im a typical overweight American Great Sale PriceLucky Timing All Black and fully Assembled Doesnt get any easier than that Batman Great Value The perfect size for Guitar practice and Strong enough,positive
With the grips these are comfortable and not as prone to falling out of your and when your hand gets moist from sweat Great picks,positive
Its no frills It doesnt feel like quality leather to me The construction is pretty basic It is a very good value though It does seem like it can deal with some wear and tear They definitely mean basic but its overall a good strap,positive
A very boring dull uninspiring Pedal Dont waste your time with this A Boss SD1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range Boring Boring Boring,negative
Ive used these Elixir strings for years and I would never change These have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others Best strings ever,positive
Works well and its clean no noise im starting to find out even if the price is low it doesnt mean its not good WORKS,positive
I have run sound for several large churches providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting The way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different especially when applying vocal effects I have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 yearsThe 8020 rule says that if you can get 80 of the sound youre looking for with 20 of the work be satisfied This Mic Mechanic MM is more like 99 of the sound with 1 of the workI actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound Primarily because it solves SO many problems that you face as a sound engineer1 Adaptive tone The MM continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression gate EQ and deessing Even when recording dry vocals at a minimum you should at least set your compression then in post production add parametric EQ to place your vocals where they need to be setNow I hit the tone button and all that is done for me It makes a dynamic mic sound great It makes working with a condenser mic easier2 Reverb Most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb They either use too much or too little With this when you it equally between wet and dry you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life I recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb Each one sat just right When you solo the vocals you can tell which is used In the mix it was more subtle Good Job3 Pitch correction I have to admit my own vocals arent perfect When you record your own vocals and youre like me youll hear a chorus sound in your headphones Thats because youre hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones This takes a second to get use toWhen set in the center you can still do your vocal gymnastics slide into notes and it seems natural It pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale so if youre way off it will make your vocals sound outIm not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing Forget the 8020 rule,positive
Changed the strings on my Epiphone EB0 bass today for the first time using this productFit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare Cutter works great winder makes the job really fast 10 minutes it took for all 4 strings Next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing Highly recommended Love it,positive
I bought this to make it easier to switch guitars on the job I often go from an electric to an acoustic or a Gibson humbucker loaded guitar to a single coil Fender For that one job it works well with no noticeable noise in my VOX VT30 amp Other reviewers said that the two level controls only work if are using this pedal for a one in to two out situation one guitar to two amps That is definitely correct In a two in two guitars to one amp situation only one level control works which isnt bad if you need to compensate for any volume loss from the pedal For 2500 it a pretty useful pedalA quick word about Behringer stuff I have several Behringer pedals and other Behringer equipment I never had a problem with their stuff Not once I often read these reviews that complain about the low quality of Behringer stuff and the plastic case on the effects pedals but I have yet to damage one of the pedals and I admit that I am not that careful with my live equipment This stuff is the best bargain on the market Are my Behringer Eurolive active PA speakers as good as my Mackie SRM450 speakers No but the Behringers cost about 25000 each while my Mackies cost twice as much If money is not a problem you should go with the bigger name brands but often at three to four times the cost and with only minor improvementsI am a weekly player and have been for 40 years I wish this stuff had been around when I first started playing Simple and does the job,positive
Bought this in early March this year have it inline with my other effects pedals on my pedal board No problems with it at all It works as advertised Ive found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my Fender GDec amp so what does that tell youNot sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because I love mine For the money you cant get one that touches it So what if its not 100 That means you have more green stuff to buy other thingsSince buying this one having it work so well I now own a couple of other Behringer pedals No Problems Here Works Great,positive
I tried this about 3 months ago I use Fender 150Ls and with it the longevity doubles I play every day and gig one or two nights They normally go dead in a week or less I just did my 3rd weekend with the same set I put it on when necessary on gig breaks After practicing I wipe down the strings first with a cloth and fretboard then I put the Slick on Next day its not so oily that it bothers me since I dont care for that oily feeling I just ordered 2 more of these Obviously I think it a good productUpdate about 2 years later I wont do without these They are part of my rig and I always have an extra at home in case it is time to change They also last quite a long time maybe 7 months Works Great For Me,positive
I had read lots of reviews about Behringer some people had buzz and noises etc but this is not my case Im not a professional and I just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitarpedal my tascam DR03 my mobile as sometimes I use the Tascam to record the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to followThis mixer works great NO noise NO buzz NO nothing but working as expected Great product for entry level and great price for what you get Great entry level product,neutral
I didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good It sounds just as good if not better than my Roland Cube 20 of course without the effects and such but still a great little amp for practice and a little gig with family and friends Puts out pretty good power for a little 5w Has a great sound in my opinion I was skeptical at first,positive
As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different I love Fenders especially telecasters I love the simplicity of two pickups two knobs and a pup selector I wanted something with P90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late You can get a lot more for your money these daysI pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P90 by Epi and have been really impressed I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet I cant really think of anything to changePros Simple TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel Sounds KILLER through my tube amps Peavey Classic 30 and 50 Fender Blues Jr lightweight stays in tune cheap price not afraid to take it out to a gig not afraid to have it stolen let my kids play it etc comfortable neck profileCons Cheap tuners but stay in tune cheap electronics wiring some frets are long and sharp my high E string gets caught under the 14th15th fret I havent filed it yet messy job at nut and fret boardAll in all this is a great guitar for a great price I still plan on modding it but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections My upgrades if any will be new pots caps wiring nut perhaps tuners No need to replace these pickups You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrumentAs a bit of a guitar snob love my US Fenders this guitar is getting a lot of action I say this one just may be a keeper Works for me,positive
great useful product well made quite and lots of use to view of my floor effects works great and no other noise from it buy it electricfingersyoutubecom,positive
well First of all I am a beginner I do not know anything about guitar I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all The string does not corroded but I changed mine anyway The fret does not have any issue at all and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect When my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced He thought the guitar cost 300 above He also bought one this morninghahaanyways I buy it from amazon and the packaging is greatMy guitar comes in a perfect condition and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody Great Guitar for both beginner and expert,positive
It may be a challenge to assemble itI personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how I am wiredI am not good at putting things together without helpGood product after you get it assembledJames good adjustable music stand for the price,neutral
far as i can tell good strings They do the job and they feel great Not much to sayI got exactly what I expected good strings,positive

I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time and the fret board was so dry and colorless I used this and the color became rich and less dry If your fret board is pretty dry DO NOT remove the oil Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is I love this because it doesnt leave an oily residue and it doesnt have a smell that stands out I didnt even notice a smell I definitely would say this is a musthave Amazing,positive
This plug works very well I like the right angle connectors I have a Korg Pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals It included a multiplug cable but not a right angle one The connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard This works much better Works very well,positive
If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder I have a less expensive solution for you if you own a usb wall charger like a cell phone charger you can use that to power your device through its usb port Thats a lot cheaper than spending twentysomething dollars on an additional wall wart Save your money A cheaper alternative,negative
It does what its supposed to do Its as well made as most I think They all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade The screen pops out easily but it will pop back in It works well for my home recording Decent Pop Filter,positive

What else is there to say they are easy to use they are easy to install and they are easy to check Ive tried them all and these are the only ones I come back to No expensive pads to buy just use water Simple to drop down into the body of guitar no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole Comes out as easy as it goes in I have 4 of them Love Dampits used on all my acoustics,positive
I bought the two pack and Ive found them both to be a bit finicky Sometimes they turn on right away and other times you have to click the button a couple times to get it to light up When theyre on and working they work well and I like the small size and tight profile against the headstock I just wish they were a little more reliable DAddario NS Micro ClipOn Tuner 2 pack,neutral

Im a 4 string rock bass player that has purchased a LOT of overdrive and fuzz pedals Most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass They typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end dont provide enough dynamics or dont provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdriveThis incredible inexpensive box really nails it You get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your likingThe downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that Joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits The whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an OCD ripoff The frosted side of me loves that I saved a LOT of money buying this ripoff Surprisingly excellent tone from such a cheap box,positive
This Dual splitter works perfect I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings The most important part of video is the audio you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal I always say half of video is audio For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJs mixer to get my audio The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking Often though the signal is to hot the music is crap or the dj says something stupid With just the DJs voice I can edit the way I want and compress time This product has improved my productions beyond its price sold I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJs wireless systems to my own audio recorder They work perfectly and havent failed me once Great Product for running a clean separate line of audio,positive

This is a great package for beginners I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called Easy Ukelele available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune I purchase this as gift to my sons 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it I did however checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs outMy Review1 The Package The box comes with the Ukelele Beginners Manual DVD CD carry pack and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the Easy Ukelele app I mentioned above2 The Ukelele The Ukelele looks and feels decent It has a sticker that says made in china It comes prestrung but it is out of tune I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings Basically the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments Since the string is nylon I gave it a chance to settle I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string It could be that the string included is a cheap one After doing this a few time on day 1 I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book Clementine But after 1 song you have to tune it again I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem This morning I checked the note again and they stay close to the GCEA range I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more Even if I have to tune it every day I would not have any problem with itSo for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned just give the string a try to settle This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around 900 for a set Another place you can check is the tuner make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little That is an easy fix2 The String As I mentioned above it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles Even if you buy a good quality strings I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string The second thinnest is the E string The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string The extra string package says Gangia Brand on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string3 The Book I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons Each song have a chart on which chord you will use4 The Case The case will protect your ukelele from dust water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop5 The DVDs and CDs I have not tried the DVD and CDs yet but the DVDs I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CDOverall This is a great price for the package Great Package It finally stayed in Tune after multiple adjustments,positive
This is what I have needed for many years Really well made very sturdy and will last forever and it is useful for all the Guitar work I need to do I think it is reasonably priced as well Thanks for a great product and good prompt service Cheers Great Product,positive
I have an older version of this model but it works great I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot 2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind The hanger itself that I bought was used so it was already assembled so I cant comment too much on the assembly process I bought 2 of them and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worryfree security And no I dont own stock in the company Very sturdy and attractive,positive
Behringer usually makes good stuff and this Reverb Is No different but what It does best Is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb Nothing else I wanted this for Singing and I have the Danelectro FAB Echo which gives a short distance echo but I wanted something without the slap back and this does what I want It for but Not quite as much depth as I wanted but with The Music I do Not think Anyone can tell If You want a good Reverb that Is above average with much depth then get the Behringer RV600 Not this The power supply I use Is Danelectro which Is great I also have a godlyke that I use Average,positive
As musicians sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level For me it happened when I found just the right sound feel from my Taylor acoustic guitar the right vocal mics the right mixer my Bose L1 Model II etcToday I had one of those finds After years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo Ive encountered I discovered the perfect capo for me the G7th Performance Capo Im not kidding it was one of those finds As an acoustic guitar player vocalist obviously I have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance This means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shapestructure Unfortunately some of my songs had weak spots sending them to my B list courtesy of the combination of a weaker chord for me due to physical limitations the reduced sustain tonal quality resulting from using a capo This dissatisfaction has had me on a capo quest which ended today when I found the G7th Performance CapoThe first thing I noticed when I used the G7th was the improved sustain over every other capo Ive used All of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared I quickly dusted off several songs that were on my B list found the improved sustain tonal quality allowed me to move them to my A listI have no problem with the weight of this capo others have pointed out that it is heavier I cant detect any change in balance when handling my guitar I play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance I love the selfratcheting feature of the G7th I thought from some reviews videos I watched that Id have to pinchdown on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold this was NOT the case I think the G7th has just the right width density of foam under the top bar a providing more friction to hold this capo in place b playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings c possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrowharder foam or rubber top bar thus having less impact on tuningI did find one slight negative about this capo which I was able to quickly overcome The end of the top metal bar on the open end of capo is slightly more squaredoff than the end of the bottom piece which in contrast is rounded off It may be just the way I play some chords but my hand was contacting that squaredoff end of the top bar was getting irritated so I simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me versus facing the floor the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother thus zero irritation This was nothing new to me I have had to do this with other caposOthers have commented on the cost of this capo For me the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars Ive spent finding just the right guitars PAs mics other equipment accessories I almost cant believe it only cost me 40 to make such a difference in my sound The G7th Performance Capo is priceless Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this capo if youre like me this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level Im a strong believer in having backups for critical components so I will immediately purchase another G7th as a backup maybe Ill order the black or gold use my silver one as the backup PRICELESS My Capo Quest is over,positive
I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars Somehow I had gravitated over to other brands including Martin and DAddario I got a set of these strings as well as the Phosphor Bronze design through the Vine program and chose to this set out on a Seagull Artist Mosaic rather than on a Taylor Martin or Gibson The result is outstanding So much so that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acousticelectric guitars with Elixers againI have also tried the new Phosphor Bronze strings in this series on a Gibson and had fine results Because I did not use both sets of strings on the same guitar it is not possible for me to really comparecontract the These strings play as smoothly and easily as do the Phosphor Bronzes and seem to add a good deal of depth to the already resonant mellowness of the SeagullElixer definitely still has the edge Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments These Do Wonders For My Seagull,positive
Of course this stand is not nearly as solid feeling as my muchheavier solidmetal music stand I use at home It does twist around a bit when you handle it On the other hand its much lighter collapsible and it goes inside my practice bag instead of being a piece of furniture that takes another hand to lug For my practices and rehearsals I want to travel light This stand fits that bill and its desk angle is adjustable so it works well for large fake books and for a single lead sheet I had two pieces of thin plexiglass cut at my local hardware store to sandwich separate sheets of music so I have no problems with wind or with threesheetwide scores Ive never had a sturdiness problem with this stand and Ive never had it tip over but I am careful not to tighten the knobs more than necessary and I set the legs to their sturdiest position I always play sitting so height is not a consideration for me But I have measured it and found that at its highest elevation the bottom of the sheet music is 50 off the floor Thats plenty high for me even if I were a vocalist and Im 61 Sure it does not impress as would an 80100 stand but the quality is almost unbelievable for 13 I notice that some of the negative reviews are two or three years old and I wonder if this stand was the same design then that it is now It IS a lightweight stand and I take care with the knobs but I certainly would not call it flimsyOne discrepancy that might be important to you The stand they delivered to me this month October 2011 was NOT a two section stand as advertised Its all in one section and it collapses down to a 20 length that fits in my practice bag I actually consider this a plus since it makes it quicker and easier to erect at rehearsals I bought one of these Hisonic Signature stands a few years back but theyve changed it a bit That one definitely was in two sections and I made the top section into an excellent tabletop book stand That older one also had foldingcliptype clamps for each section instead of the turnknobscrewin type of clamps High portability and low price,positive
What can I say These are probably the most wellknown pads available and probably the best This was the best price I could find on Amazon and they arrived as described via very prompt shipping Great Price Best Pads,positive
I believe Ive rated this instrument before I really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it I also like the fact that it doesnt require a 9 Volt Battery whereas others I played did I would buy from this company again and probally will in the future Thank You Full Size Thinline AcusticElectric Guitar,positive
Simple product easy to use that works exactly as its supposed to without costing too much I got one for a banjo Ubass mandolin but of course you can use this on anything Works great simple to use,positive
I swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts9 tube screamer You wont regret this purchase Bye bye TS9,positive
I purchased a budget passive soundhole pickup for a guitar I bring to a local open micTo get any volume from it the sound guy had to boost the channel very high and the sound was still a bit thin I found the Behringer PB100 and after reviewing various posts about it as well as checking out the YouTube demos of the device I purchased it I used it for the past four weeks at the open mic and have been impressed with how it boosts the sound without effort I can add a bit of bass which makes the guitar finally sound as it should too This pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now Works as expected isnt that what we all want,positive
I have owned just about every tuner made They all had pluses and minuses I like this one a lot It is my tuner of choice right now The backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate It is also small which I appreciate For this price 15 you simply cant go wrong Good Tuner,positive
This soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player right up there with a tuner string windercutter cleaning cloth pack of extra picks and capo Its designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system which it does nicely Its also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly as in 2 nights like that in a case Absolute musthave for Acousticelectric players plugging into a PA,positive
Sometimes I have to run a longer cable to a snake if Im doing the big band thing Otherwise I use this cable at every show Love it Use it at every gig,positive
Arrived as expected and as described Capo is well made and is very well priced I am very happy with the purchase Great Item great price,positive
Just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of PA equipment on a cart Aside from the two speaker stands I can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand Very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles I dont expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart so Im assuming the stitching is more than sufficient At 20 this bag looks like a great value Well worth 20 simple and sturdy,positive
My guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings They sound wonderful and cost very little Whats not to love Inexpensive and sound great,positive
This is my first strobe tuner So far it has been wonderful for intonationinitial setups It may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure it is accurate The only thing I dont like is that the housing feels cheap Like plasticy cheap It was packaged in an attractive tin which is not good for fitting in the guitar case and I wouldnt take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the goto tunerIt is easy to use though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tunerUPDATEThe battery life is short as noted by another reviewer Since I only use it for initial setups and intonations I remove the battery when I place it back in its tin Theres a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful Accurate Seems fragile,positive
The reviewer who wrote that that these are cheap foam worth 500 doesnt understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators AB these with some 500 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had It seems my speakers were audio coupling with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequenciesMy problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80125 HZ Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate I didnt hear it when I mixed my Hafler M1 speakers I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range The Behringers also had all the power I needed active speakers and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end I love these speakers Fortunately I was at a friends studio a great pro studio and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers He said he loved them I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on WOW What a difference It was an immediate difference The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies cut them back to almost flaton the new mix I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem Cheap foam I dont think so Excellent product,positive
At the time I bought was 16 Mine arrived broken so it had gone back Reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken Not upset about that stuff happens It is just not a good stand Light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped The protective materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft shiny runner like materail and it sticks to my instruments neck So I pick up uke and I get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity Happened every time Yes I tried out the stand even though broken and it proved to be a bad choice Back it has gone 5 stars to Amazons return policy thouh Poorly Made Flimsy Buy Another Product,negative
I have several different slides glass brass steel short long etcAnd this has become my go to for every slide guitar session I play onI wear it on my ring finger It fits great the tone is amazing on acoustic electric and banjoWorks great for blues rock a little stoner country and even some metal the main genres I play inHarmonics and sustain to spareI keep it in my pocket at all times now it goes with me everywhere And has never failed to lay down some mojo when I bring it out my go to slide,positive
Ive owned these for several years and found them sufficient for mixing purposes so long as I keep using reference songs for comparison thats because by themselves the ATHM50 dont have a flat frequency response Theyre flatter than most phones under a hundred but you will find that theyre a bit too middy and lacking in lower treble regions compared with a good set of studio monitorsFortunately I found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective EQ curve Load up a parametric EQ and do the following 1dB 80Hz Q of 5 15dB 350Hz Q of 2 25 dB 1kHz Q of 1 1dB 3kHz Q of 1 2dB 65kHz Q of 35 and 15dB 15kHz Q of 3 Save this as a presetIf you listen to reference songs with this youll find a more pleasing balanced 3D kind of sound compared to the original I base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the ATHM50 The proof that this worked is that now these headphones sound a lot like my good studio monitors They translate better with the correction curve activeThe bass on these is solid and seems to go down to 20Hz or so more felt than heard Subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound This is where these headphones are better than studio monitors unless you have a well treated room with a good sub I therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs I also use them for editing slight sounds pops clicks and getting reverb tails right and with help panning tracks they are VERY good for this like a magnifying glassThe foam pads and black paint on the headband will crack and fall off after 2 years I wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well Replacement pads can be bought on Amazon So the padding material coating could have been better made That plus the middy frequency response is why I give 4 stars instead of 5 But I still think theyre the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred EQ correction curves for the ATHM50,positive
This tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone or direct plug in for electric instruments This has the microphone feature but is better used with the clip on vibration mode Just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string A multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat Easy to use Colorful accurate easy to use and fun,positive
Very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal If all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy Easy as a one knob pony,positive
it is a good purchase I expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job I would like the plate to be heavier seems a little flexy good purchase,positive
Shipped in time Didnt test microphones yet but I think this is best price for 7 microphones According to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well Ill check it later Quite well,positive
these are good I dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range they all work well length of being brillant is somewhat limits but it appears to be in most of these level of strings these are good,neutral
Works great seems durable shipped fast Cant think of a single negative thing about this product If you need a tuner this ones a good one Snark meets expectations,positive
I bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park This is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price Just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it nice amp,positive
If you want to do swells with your instrument or make notes 34cry34 this will do the trick Smooth reliable action and no noise too A great volume pedal,positive
I use this with my small mobile DJ setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer Simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all Handy little mixer,positive
They work good Way to stiff and small for me though Great attack but holding onto it is the problem The slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings I imagine it would work great for lead players but Im a rhythm player Good just not for me,neutral
really cool looking rosin works well and is just overall awesome you cant break it either becuase its in wood awesome,positive
I used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly I bought my dad one too he loves it too Best tuner,positive
This product makes changing strings on a guitar easy a must for anyone with any type guitar It is basically the same thing sold or made all the major brands of guitars It holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments It also is easy to store when finished Fender Mat,positive
Its not bad It would be better if I bought one large enough for my finger Still Id rather stick with a Copper slide Its decent,neutral
This stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great Im going to be switching to a 7 stand rack soon for all my basses but I will still keep this around because it holds up well Love the all black look as well Good Stand,positive
Look at this pedal Look at what it does and what it costs 30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor and thats if you dont even try to hunt down a lower price By contrast Bosss TU2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing and it costs 100 retailYes the housing is made of plastic I dont know about you but I generally wont be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set If you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive And if it doesnt so what Its cheap to replaceThe other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens Mines developed a touchy input jack over time its actually the earlier TU100 model but I dont know that its totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap One star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair I own three other Behringer pedals as well and theyre still going strongA tuner is an essential part of any musicians rig and this does the job just fine Use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playingUPDATE After having used a new tuning pedal for some time I will admit that yes this is a subpar tuner However I still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay this isnt a bad investment For a guitarist just starting out this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound For the price Pfft,positive
I am absolutely delighted with this tunner One comment my son has one also the neck of his broke so he warned me I am always very careful when turning the 34head34 I can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen As far as tuning goes I am very pleased I moved from a guitar to a harp so I am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful Plus my vision is not the best and this one I can really see My Second Tunner and I really like it,positive

Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints dust oxidation squeaks or 34gummy areas34 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new I dont like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs I threw out my Gibson spray Too oily DrDucks Wax is worth the extra 3 This bottle will last a lifetime You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish Perfect I shouldve been using this stuff years ago Thanks,positive
Very nice cable I used this with my Planet Waves 9v adapter It works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful The Onespot adapter itself would probably be even better as it only takes one place on a power strip etc instead of a chunky old school adapter like the Planet Waves style Really nice product for the price Power Plant,positive
Not much you can say The headline says it all It works well Shipping takes time but for the price who cares If you need it now go local but if you have time to wait this is perfect I ordered two just in case But it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all It works and should last,positive
DOWNGRADE TO 1O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS THE SELLERI am really disappointed by the seller BrookMays ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup which picks up unwanted noise by the wires own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup wont have the same issue After two weeks of the returned item was delivered I didnt hear anything from the seller regarding the return so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap Too bad four days after the email had been sent I only got the email of telling me the case of the message I sent without any further response to my refund until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle and I dont think its worth to waste more time on it despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs Therefore yesterday I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad aftersale service I ever have before if I still havent heard from the seller shortyToday I finally received the sellers response to my refund the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims it was not defective All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar The feedback can be to to many other issues I have issued the refund of 704 Obviously the reply is unconvincing although the feedback can be raised from varies issues i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups but it doesnt have such problems at all The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didnt try many pickups Cherub Guitar Pickup doesnt work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises Moreover the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying and theres no way to stop the wire movements while strumming Indeed I wont use it and I dont want it to sit at my house as a useless property so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has However the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and its NOT worth at allBy the way Im also unhappy about the refund of 704 I bought it for 879 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of 25 or more To me it is not the money of 175 but its not fair to the buyer who doesnt get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter So if you really need a pickup for your instrument I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one Dont make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price in turn you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise I dont want that happens to anyone else so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICEI like the clipon design which is easy to use so it is worth 2 stars however it doesnt work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings Besides that it also picks up loudly through the wires own movements not as the description regardless the surrounding noises I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback However when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke the amp doesnt have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume and the other pickup doesnt have the unwanted noise from its own movement either I dont know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got I bought it because its cheap price less than 9 clipon design but I cant accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller So if you want to give it a try you may bear in mind that the seller BrookMays doesnt take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesnt work properly as claimed description Good Luck then Picks up UNWANTED NOISE BAD AFTERSALE SERV,negative
In an attempt to see whats new in the pick industry I decided to dive in and give these a go They are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just cant compete Not only were they too flimsy but when I played with any aggression heavy rockbased material the picks would fly out of my hands This was a huge disappointment Too flimsy,negative
It is really the best pick holder i ever had I can put 6 7 picks on it It says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb I recommend Yes really the best,positive
Theyre just great Awesome for chord based songs If you need to pick individual notesstrings then you might want to go a bit thicker With that said you can do it with these but the tone is not as nice sounds a bit softer Best picks for songs with a lot of chord strumming,positive
And sounds crisp I had alesis io2 express which did a similar job But after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video I finally broke down I heard more definition with the guitar Now that I have it I take the quality for granted It has higher quality and the dials feel solid The little limiter lamp is awesome Im very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job My old Alesis had midi pass through which didnt work anyway so feature for feature this is a better pick even if its around 40 bucks more Does the job,positive
I had sworn off Chorus pedals years ago the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same Not with the MXR Analog Chorus very musical and transparent I like the presets recommended in the instruction manual the stereo out is very cool for using two amps and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last forever By the way this is the exact same pedal as the Zak Wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job not all of us are metal heads Super Lush and MUSICAL,positive
This is a very accurate tuner I have used it on mandolins guitars violins and violas and double bass They are a little hard on batteries but not overly soHighly recommend Great tuner,positive
Just use a cloth or paper towel Not Worth The Money,negative
My new goto strings These things last forever for someone who only plays casually They sound great too Absolutely recommend it Sweaty fingers,positive
I have owned this guitar for about 2 years now and it still has a great sound and is very playable especially for the money It stays in tune very well even though the tuners do seem a little cheaper than Epiphones Ive owned in the past but hey they work so why change them The overall fit and finish of the guitar is excellent for the price point and mine has the flat black finish which hides fingerprints very well The neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing The single coil p90 style pickups on this guitar scream with their own beautiful raw sound and were the reason I bought this guitar Take note that p90s do make a humming sound when youre not playing which can be remedied by turning down the volume knob This is why humbucker style pickups were invented but the compromise of a humbucker is you lose a lot of the bite and energy that p90s give you It really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar I currently play it through a Fender Vibro Champ tube amp and this combo really makes playing guitar fun I recommend this guitar if youre on a budget like me or even if youre not on a budget and want a p90 equipped guitar in your stable A great guitar for the money,positive
Purchased this and a comparable Hosa cable This cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved Hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling I will stick to GLS products from this point forward A high performer,positive

I am an acoustic guitar addict With five sixstring and onetwelve I play every day and in a years time I go through a lot of strings Over the years I have come to favor the phosphorbronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument For a long time I believed that brands of them were interchangeable so I bought whatever was available at the best price No more These DAddarios are the sweetest easiest to play and not that this is the most important variable to me the longest lasting of any of the phosphor bronze strings I have usedThere is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened Martins Gibsons GHS Adamas and Elixirs as well as other varieties of DAddario strings I think its time to sell them off These EXP16s are superior to them allI have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong To play as well as I am able I require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up Soundwise I look for a blend of brightness and warmth on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar These DAddarios do both things and do them wellOther reviewers have been somewhat critical about the slickness of these strings I simple did not experience that at all As with ALL guitar strings they should be wiped with a dry lintfree cloth after each and every playing Not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of ANY string As a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable I bought 6 sets and plan to use them all both Mediums and Lights for my stringed friends Smooth and Sweet Great Phosphor Bronze Strings,positive
I buy this cable for my dj system and work great i used a lot of time with my karaoke very god cable,positive
I wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after I change guitars I bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap It has served its purpose and I use it nearly everyday Very happy with purchase Simple but effective,positive
I bought two sets 6 total Great cables no added hum The only down side I will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal boardGood problem to have Nice cables no hum,positive
This pedal is very nice It looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great You can just plug it into your keyboard and play It works very well Beautiful,positive
I use these on all my guitars Love them Easy to assemble and use If you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on Once installed they are fantastic These are the best,positive
Not every tune needs tremolo I grant you but when you need one this will do the job and them some Simple controls The LED pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the units settings at all times 100 silent switching In a FX loop theres not a trace of hiss hum or noise in any form In a chain running into an amps input there is a slight volume increase Not much but a little No big deal really unless youre a real tone freak There is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use Being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either The box is ultra solid The jacks are all metal The switch is stout In short this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean warm tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit It it anchored to my board It is not going to come off because its that good Besides how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it If you need a tremolo pedal look no further,positive
This guitar strap was so inexpensive compared to the other ones I was concerned that it would be flimsy and look terrible Since I planned on using it as a mandolin strap I figured it would be alright if it wasnt strong enough for a guitarI was pleasantly surprised to find it wellmade with a clean simple appearance I am getting another one for my acoustic guitar and may replace the leather strap on my electric guitar with one of these also Great product at great price,positive
The first rule of microphones is that No one microphone is perfect for every purpose Rule two is Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound Ive used Shure SM58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968 I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used and still do use them for singing some back up vocalsThe SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use Some people me included actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic the Shure SM57 The SM58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice For example anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM58 People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM58The SM58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect which means the bass increases the closer you get This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they dont sound right On the other hand the SM57 sounds best several inches away from the users mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away While the SM58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly It works ok for conga drums and the like but the SM58 is about the last thing youd want to use to mic a sax or guitar Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice but for some people they sound great The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM57 with a windscreen However for other people the SM58 works better It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do If you have a very deep voice the SM58 might be the second best choice after the SM57 which has a better low frequency responseOne certain advantage of the SM58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal Another advantage of the SM58 is that it is still available at a slight extra cost with a builtin onoff switch The SM58s ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars Ive seen SM58s dented rusty dusty smoked up spit into with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet Ive never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an onoff switch that got dirt in itAll the proline Shure mics are top quality The pro line Shures also hold their value well If you buy one and decide you dont like it you can get about what you paid for it on eBay I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one Senneheisers EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look The SM58 will be the number one onstage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today theyd still be around for another 20 years at least Good for vocals only,positive
This is a really nice sturdy pedal with a really warm tone I have a Marshall MG15CFX solid state amp This pedal sounds really good on the clean channel but you can hear that it is not designed for a solid state dirty channel It has given me another tool in my toolbox and basically added a 5th channel to my 4 channel Marshall Great classic rock 70s tone It responds really well to my pick attack You really cant go wrong for the money Great OD Pedal for the Money,positive
Fast delivery and exactly as advertised Put it to work making music within minutes The steel gives a clearer sound than the glass bottle slides but you need both Good product Nice very nice,positive
I use these on my Hofner and Gibson ES135 They sound amazing and feel fantastic These will be the only strings to go on my Jazz guitars from now on Perfect Flatwounds,positive
I bought this mic after hearing good things about it but I had never tried it It has impressed me quite a bit since then I use it in a small home studio setup along with a Presonus Firebox and Logic Pro on a MacbookFor the price this mic is a very good deal It sounds much better than an Audio Technica 3035 that I had and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic I also got an Oktava MK319 that is a much more expensive mic and that was then sent to be moded by Michael Joly and therefore cost even more and Id say the two mics are very similar I end up using the CAD M179 a lot more because its less valuable but sounds just as goodWhat else It has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant It sounds particularly great for male vocals in my opinion although I have used it for as a room drummic I would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point Excellent mic for the price esp for vocals,positive
This design is a big improvement over string swings past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch I will buy more if I get another guitar Sturdy and good looking,positive
Arrived quick These are good replacements or upgrades Work much better then the other style of string trees I would recommend this Nice,positive
Back plate has a greenish tint and is single ply not 3ply as advertisedColor wasnt as advertised its more of an offwhite than a vintage cream But I guess its close enough considering the priceShipping took far too long Not sure if Music123 or USPS is to blame for that but Id go with USPSBesides those minor faults the items fit well and look goodMy 2006 Strat now has the look of a 57 without the huge price tag Decent overall except for backplate,neutral
Its a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost The fact that it looks like its made out of Bat Armor is a huge plus For a clipon you cant beat the accuracy this little unit gives you Guess what It tunes really well,positive
Great ukulele Very light which is nice Intonation is spot on looks beautiful tooA perfect soprano ukulele for a beginner or an experienced player looking for a nicelooking affordable ukulele Great ukulele for a great price,positive
What else can be said about Aquila High priced Ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best Even if you have a very cheap ukulele adding these strings can turn a toy uke into something that wont embarrass you I use Aquila and Martin strings in my ukuleles the Aquila for most performances and the Martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional 34Hawaiian34 sound as the Aquilas are a tad heavier than Martin Even if this if you only have one ukulele and you wont for long you cant go wrong with these strings The standard for Ukulele players,positive
This amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from 34modelling34 amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through This Behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five 34flavor34 settings in each They are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you youve switched gears Here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty There is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar The foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine The EQ sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs youd have to be right up on them to see how they are set Ive had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentionedits velcroed on there just fine The cabinet is covered in a nice brown leatherlike material Plenty loud Great value amp easy to use,positive
How much can you say about a patch cable This is a good one at a good priceI recommend it Its a patch cable that just works,positive
First time I ordered these was in a larger order and Amazon forgot to put them in the box Oops I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge Thank you AmazonI like the tone of DAddarios 8020 bronze strings Ive been playing more bluegrassy guitar lately so Ive switched to mostly using phosphor bronze but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 8020 stringsAmazon has the best price on these and theyre inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it I like their tone and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time Great strings good price Amazon misshipped the first time,positive

Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings For the price paid its very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired Overall I can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at 15 to 20 dollars then sure Still its an OK product A tad bit noisy and cheaply made,neutral
Its okay Ive bought stands for less that were more balanced and sturdy and the little 34safety34 strap is a nuisance more than a help Take a stand but not necessarily this one,neutral
Great idea well made nice heavy webbingFit probly 6 or more picks No need to gluescrew junk on your axe maybe good with slide or capo havent tried But good product and price Misplaced pick,positive
This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well Try oneI think that you will love it if thats what youre looking for Serves the purpose,positive
I was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick I saw this and had to try it They are very solid dont bend and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar Havent tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too You need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action not a surprise But the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat Anyway these are great guitar picks if youre looking for something solid and longlasting Stainless Steel guitar picks whoda thunk it,positive
If you want to have an interesting echo and repeat this is worth the minimal investment I recommend buying the multiplug power supply as it goes through batteries fairly quickly and you will likely be buying other pedals to compliment this one Interesting effects pedal,neutral
This is good for the money It is short but works with the small amp that I purchased I am done Good cable,positive
This is a simple analog chorus Its straight forward and perfect for any board and guitarist that needs a little chorus from time to time like myself Everything you need,positive
wish i discovered these years ago comfortable and the grip works wonders nice clear tones with this pick tips thanks excellent,positive
I like many things about this tuner The fact that it turns off quicker than most and you only have to press the button to turn it off Unlike the Fender which you have to press and hold May not sound like a big deal but if you need to change tune in the middle of a show this ones faster The Fender tuner in my opinion and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up But this ones cheaper Ahh decisions decisions Still you cant go wrong either way 5 stars but I still prefer my Fender tuner,positive
You have to get this cap on JUST right or the strings will buzz I think Ill keep this as a backup and get a better one for my every day use Not the greatest,neutral
Extra Light gives good action for my small guitar Not so hard on the fingers Tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge Good strings for my 34 size acoustic guitar,positive
I was having some problems with my Ego Compressor comp getting noisey sent it back and found out that It Had been using a slightly drained battery so I got one of these and it is great nice and quiet again half the price of the boss one excellent quiet pedal power,positive
Good quality Adjustable and does not get in the way Great improvement over spring capos Not much more to say but need five more words to post Like it,positive
I have been using this gig bag for the past few months If I do the math I probably didnt use it more than 10 times basically from home to the subway from the subway to the studio and back so maybe 20 minutes walk each time So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes mostly carrying it on my shoulders sometimes by one of the two handlesThen the side handle started coming apart the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking which I kind of expect at this point Meanwhile Im going to buy another sturdier gig bagSave your money and get something better than this Cheaply made only lasted a few months,negative
I bought this to add into the Axess MP1504BLK Professional Dual Wireless Microphone I bought for home Karaoke use for my kids 6 and under The microphone could not pickup voice until it is about an inch close to your mouth When you have it close to your mouth it does sounds well enough that my kids enjoy I added this screen to protect the microphone from getting damage or wet when it falls or when my kids touches the microphone to their mouth Since this package came with 5 screen I can wash it when it gets dirty and use the reserve to always have a clean microphone for my kidsThe quality of the screen is very good I believe that it can withstand abuse and will be able to handle frequent wash without ruining the material Good Quality Microphone Wind Screen,positive
I actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for 60 but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new with no complaints For such a small combo this amp really packs a punch It is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs However you could use it in larger venues also since you generally mic up your amp anyway and get most of your sound from monitorsAnyway the clean channel is what you would expect from any Fender amp with good tone and crisp reverb The high gain channel is really fat sounding I still use distortion pedals and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one but without a pedal the high gain channel performs adequatelyFor the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion Kind of does away with the need for a half stack unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors Plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol The perfect amp for small venues and of course your home,positive
I got it to have it if I needed it I have found that i dont really need it that often and rarely use it If I was really good I can see the need But this is a keyboard not an organ It works great but I hardly use it,positive
Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it There are gig bags and there are gig bags Ive ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags I expected more This one offers almost no protection The only reason I have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund but may end up returning it anywayIt did fit my Kala KATG with room to spare Not a lot of protection,negative
The price was right so I got one Does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music Books dont do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time even some smaller ones Strictly for practice Okay for sheet mucis but not for even the smallest of books,neutral
Almost a perfect pic for me I use a 73mm Just wish it was more like a fender pic finishthat being fender seems to stick to your fingers better This pic seems to have a coating that makes is slightly softer to the touch or something Still prefer this pic to the fender because this one holds up much much better in comparison to fender mediums Holds up very well,positive
If you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar I would suggest this I have a vintage 60s Dixon Hummingbird I was really worried about scuffing it up Dont worry with this Nice buy,positive
It tunes without any problems and I love using the word SNARK I thought the creaters could have implemented the clip feature I have seen on other tuners which tunes through vibrations but it still works great WORKS GREAT TUNES GREAT,positive
Unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier StratThey look very similar but the two pins are approximately 116th of an inch further out from the shaft so Im going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them Worse the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so Im going to have to fill them firstThe quality of the locking tuners looks greatI only wish that theyd show a diagram with the specs written on it so that I could have known that these dont fit my guitar Dont fit on my Indonesian Squier Strat,neutral
Fender 351 Picks are some of the best picks money can buyI have used these picks for years now and I just love them Fender 351 Picks,positive
As soon as I attached my mic and with my strong hands I over twisted the mic holder on the threads and the thread piece came loose on the stand I think I can fix it with some liquid metal but this is not as impressive as some mic stands Ive had in the past Sincerely DocAfter a few months of trying to make it work It doesnt I changed my rating from 3 to 1 This puppy is just poor quality Not the toughest,negative
Originally I bought another Snark and liked it well enough Id seen this one on YouTube and thought its little bobble head looked kinda silly But then a friend lent me his for a couple of days and I really liked the experience of being able to glance over and see if I was in tune I was hooked Ill look silly if it lets me stay in tuneThe builtin metronome doesnt have a lot of volume but its clearly visibleYou also get a little baggie containing three picks the carry bag for the tuner and a battery Warranty runs for a year Altogether Im very satisfied with this tuner Love love love it,positive
I initially wanted a Yamaha Pacifica 012DLX Guitar Center in Eugene claimed to have stock in website but when I reached there there wasnt any So I tested an Affinity and a Bullet HSS instead and thought the Bullet was pretty ok but they did not have the color I wanted So I ordered through Amazon but I bought a microcube from Guitar Center as Im greatful for the opportunity to test guitarsI waited for 2 weeks before I make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impressionI received the guitar in perfect condition it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors Just a few words SQUIER by Fender New strings and scratch free Made in China it says However it did not have sharp frets like I experience with some 100 bucks guitarsThe action came very high and I had intended to return it but the guitar was perfect and I couldnt find any fault to return So I proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps 1Straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod 2Then measured the string action height and set it from 15mm for the first 3 strings and 2mm for the last 3 strings 3Setup the intonation using a tuner You really need a tuner for this stepAfter that the guitar was splendid It did go out of tune in 2 or 3 days but stabilized after that I do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuningAfter 2 weeks Im still loving the guitar Beginners be warned you may like the action or may need to do setup like I did In fact Im so impressed with Squier that Im thinking of getting the Squier Standard Strat next pretty curious of the Alnico pupsLatest reviewDowngraded from 5 to 3 starsI bought a Washburn RX40 with Duncan USMThe bullet is nice but I outgrew itThe tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitiveThe bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings Tusq nut locking the trem down etcId recommend to save some money and buy something above 200 Guitars at that price may be twice the cost but is more than twice betterThe 2 important things are not in Bullet the sustain and the soundLatest reviewThe product is back at 5 starsI got the sustain to improve by increasing the actionFret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut shortThere some sounds that a Strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall shortlike attack finger plucking Very Good Guitar To me,positive
So I recently purchased the Visual Sound One Spot Combo pack and I must say I am quite pleased I was checking out some of the higher end products TRex Fuel Tank Voodoo Lab Pedal Power and just didnt feel like forking over the money Maybe one day if Im going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around 200 Ill go for one of the other products but from what I read on the Visual One power supply I was willing to take a risk especially for the great priceCurrently Im powering 4 Hardwire pedals a Dunlop Wah pedal and the Berhinger CS400 see Im cheap sometimes but effectively so So Im already using 6 of the 8 power supply cables All pedals are powered without issue without noise there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect WHATSOEVER I cant say enough how excited I was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board I just put together and when it came through and worked flawlessly it was all the better I would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals or even a moderate or novice player Its simply a RELIABLE and affordable way to power your pedal board 2 thumbs up and 5 starsRock on Im impressed satisfied and I saved myself a benjamin,positive
This music stand is og great quality and of a great priceI have been very pleased with it I have bought OnStage stands in the past before so i was sure that I wouldnt be disaapointed and I was rightVery sturdywell builtgood price excellent music stand,positive
In October 2009 I ordered a custom Strat and a Bass and the Custom Strat came with these strings I recommend going with these The bullet style makes its easier to install You know what I mean if you are a professional Great,positive
I got this for Christmas last year as a beginner learning guitar this is a must have works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadnt had to replace the batterys yet and I tune my guitar every time I play well worth it its so easy to use get it,positive
I love these strings I bought a set awhile back for my Ovation but never used them Then I came into possession of an old Yamaha acoustic guitar which was pretty beat up and needed new strings I put these suckers on there and wow was I impressed Even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings So I bought another set for the Ovation this time Sound great,positive
The black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver It fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base Solid and Upright,positive
I like these nice tortoise look with planet wave logo is nice they have more flex than most which I also find suits meThey ride a little higher for me which I also like but if you like low lets say midway across cuticle may find a bit pinchy But I find the gauge suits me great and overall comfort is good for my average thumb size Suits me,positive
Great quality product Saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome Highly recommended Time Saver,positive
Do not let the size of this little amp fool you I have used Roland and Fender amps and PAs I heard a buddy preforming with this with a drummer and bass and went and bought it the next day I use it for my small solo gigs But it will cover a good size room also Great vocal and guitar sounds I cant believe what can come out of a six and half inch speaker now a days JUST AMAZING I have cut the amount of equipment considerably that I need to do a gig anymore It wont break the bank and it wont break your back AMAZING,positive
compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board the quality is good I like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again very handy for making it all just right I will buy these again for sure compact thats what you want,positive
I guess 5 stars because it 100 does what its supposed to and doesnt cost much The width of the grip gives you more leverage which can make it easier to clamp with someone with weak hands That being said that person probably isnt playing much guitar It works,positive
I bought this one after using the SN2 for 5 monthsThe tuner works like a ChampI cant really tell the difference between the SN1 and the SN2 They both work really well with my Taylor guitar and my Fender Strat Its a steal Buy IT,positive
This is just what I needed to get rid of three or four large AC adapters Great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board Works great,positive
Not the best pedal out there but for the priceits pretty freakin awesome Love the 20 second looper and the ability to turn wah on and off by depressing the volume pedal all the way forward Solid sounds and cabinets Fun,positive
Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone Especially on acoustic These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion They have a long life and do brighten your tone Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape These are the best picks on the market,positive
The Hercules Travlite Guitar Stand is an average stand in my opinion It does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but Id keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner if you value your guitar Not a specific knock on the Hercules but most low and portable stands like this are the same they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down You may be careful around it but its hard to say for others nearby For a cheap guitar I wouldnt mind using this but for a more expensive guitar no thanksPlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help It does the job of a guitar stand but not the most sturdy,neutral
Acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one It fits perfect and even though Im not a huge whammy user its nice to have for that occasional vibrato Nice for my MIM,positive
I just needed this for my new guitar From the looks of it it complements the instrument well I am happy with it Perfect buttons,positive
This capo does exactly what it should It clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used I have 4 Kyser capos one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand Never can go wrong with Kyser,positive
I bought this because someone told me they really liked itbut its just not a good productfor me anywaysI bought this to help disperse some of the weight of my Les Paul on my shoulder The problem is the thick part of this strap is made too short so if I bring the neck of the guitar up to my shoulder at all the weight of the guitar is now on the skinny part of the strapThe leather feels a bit cheap as wellyou get what you pay forI guess the strap is ok if you play with the guitar in one positionyippeeeIll probably have to breakdown and pay 100 for a real strap Meh,neutral

From Greg Abrams review entitled For all but the tone snobs a review further down on this products pageAlright so you want to get a good if somewhat basic distortion sound for less than 100 This is your dealI strongly disagree You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for 100 or less even a few near or under the 40 mark the DS1 is currently priced atIve played guitar for over 10 years Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS1 Afterall everyone talks about them theyre available at any given music store in the nation you hear about all these famous musicians using them plus a DS1 is actually pretty cheap So I snapped one up just like everyone else Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR that doesnt always mean its GOOD see Nickelback the Transformers movie franchise the Kardashian family etcSo I plugged it in and didnt really care for it The distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy I tried it on both my amps My practic amp a solid state Fender Frontman 25R and my big amp the B52 AT100 which is a 100w tube halfstack It was was not very diverse and the basic sound was not very likeable to me Ive read the Japanese made DS1s are better in sound than the newer made in Taiwan models but either way the DS1 is just not a great pedal in my mindBut like many newer players I didnt know any better at the time Fast forward a few years and Ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes openSo here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS1 All of them are great general purpose distortions easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops and can at the time of this writing be bought brand new for 75 or less here on good ol Amazoncom and are rugged enough to last for yearsBoss DS2 Turbo Distortion Lest I catch any flames from people thinking Im a Boss hater Im certainly not I loved the TU3 the ODB3 the MD2 and the XT2 among others Ill start with the DS1s big brother This pedal has a much nicer tone to it not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS1 the II setting is a brighter richer tone As the DS1 completely overshadows the DS2 in popularity you can find DS2s all over ebay for very cheap prices A very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by manyPro Co RAT2 Great dirty distortion pedal Probably my personal favorite Youve heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists Its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy Ive never heard a bad tone out of mine Its great for getting a big amp kind of sound out of a small practice amp Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume A truly excellent pedalEHX Little Big Muff The Big Muff is another pedal youve heard on hundreds of songs Its kind of a fuzz kind of a distortion but definitely owns its own sonic territory Very big saturated and warm Used heavily in the 70s for classic rock tones also in the 90s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins Dinosaur Jr and Jack White I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue its smaller uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER A great pedalMXR Distortion The Distortion is a great first distortion and can usually be found pretty cheap Whats nice about the Distortion is that it sounds great on anything and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent ie you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp it doesnt cover over your equipments sound Used by quite a few famous folks including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia Randy Rhoads Ozzys famous guitarist and Steve Jones of the Sex PistolsDanelectro CM1 Cool Cat Metal Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal NOT the Metal II Thats a fine pedal as well but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal The Cool Cat Metal or CM1 is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals Basically its a preamp that sits on the floor It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof So you can do anything from a clean boost with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone to high gain metal stuff with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between It works well with any amp Ive tried it on and you can find tons of great sounds Its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass The best part is Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them so you can easily find one used or even new for under 30 A true hidden gem thats actually CHEAPER than a DS1Joyo JF03 Crunch Distortion This little guy surprised me Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box and if so that must be one awesome pedal too Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box and boy does it ever succeed at that Great crunch tons of volume and gain it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin stack It even sounded good going into my modeling amp very few pedals work well with my modeling amp and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in and you can get a brand new one for 40 shipped fantasticSpeaking of Joyo Ive had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN another Chinese pedal maker and Im honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag especially theMOEN MOFM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff Ive ever played through So JOYO and MOEN they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz od and dirt pedals check them out and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review DS1 included are made in America let alone the western hemisphereHopefully these suggestions give you something to look for Also if you cant actually try a pedal out at the store YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can doI should also mention that if you try and love the DS1 and it suits your needs than more power to you Tone is subjective every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love thats okay My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals the DS1 is NOT the only thing out there thats affordable Find something you truly love and buy that If its the DS1 one of the pedals Ive mentioned here or anything else the important part is that it sounds right to YOU Wish I knew then what I know now,negative
Be careful about using capos like this because if youre using a fine guitar it may damage the finish Try it and double check regularly and I wouldnt leave it clamped on the guitar overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand Be careful about using capos like this because if youre using a fine guitar,neutral
This beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price Its lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes The biggest drawback is that the one I received required the action to be adjusted The bridge needed lowered slightly and the nut held the strings way too high above the frets The result was very sore fingers These are easy fixes if you have the proper tools Otherwise youll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup Stock strings have a warm tone Good Quality for the price but needed proper setup,neutral
These strings are good especially for the price I have found better strings through DAddario however and the feel of them is superior to these in my opinion Its all personal choice,positive
The Snark SN1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate I beg to differ This is the most accurate headstock tuner that I have ever used and it also has a built in metronome which I never use but could come in handy Another thing is the price point which is simply amazing The blue color is a bit annoying however and Id like it if they came out with a black SN1 The visibility of the screen is amazing and I can see it even with the sun reflecting off of it or in a completely dark room Best headstock tuner ever,positive
Nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp great value,positive
I replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my Indiana guitar and what a difference The original equipment spring tension was so stiff that the tremolo didnt even work Now it sounds great A must have product,positive
I have tried other picks like this that had points which went as confortable This one is more confortable and has great grip If you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out great grip,positive
Works as advertised The cutter makes this thing really worth while If I lose it Im buying another 2 more words required Cool string winder,positive
I paid 10 dollars for this It must be giving me cancer in the state of california because its not cheap at all Folds up for transport works great on hardwood floors padded where it needs to be and has a strap so it doesnt fall forward either Angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet look for something where the legs enter the carpet more straight down CHEAP BUT NOT CHEAP,positive
works great small and easy to place to the side and out of the way simple setup plug it in change the preference settings and it works audio technica usb microphone,positive
This one is easy buy it Ive owned many effects over 32yrs playing some ok some didnt last 48 hours others never parted with this one fits in that category Gives excellent range of Marshall emulated sounds Great Sounds,positive
I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13inch Gooseneck Blackare too long for what I want to do Sometimes on rare occasions I have used this to extend the length of the 13 modelThe mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone which is small relatively light and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic standBecause this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars In some situations they can be a savior during set up I will empahsize though that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 which is slightly larger and heavier and this may not hold your mic in place Perfect solution for smaller lighter mics,positive
Ive been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily Ive owned it for a while now and havent had any problems with it Great iPad mic stand attachment that works great,positive
just what you see A good variety of different picks I got it for me and my dad My dad plays guitar and he likes the thinner onnes great,positive
Ok so I had to buy another item because 2 items in my cart were addon items I needed another microphone and I had been toying with the idea of purchasing a GLS mic Im extremely happy I took the chance and as soon as I submit this review Im purchasing another This is the best pricevalue purchase Ive made in a long time Im not going to insult your intelligence and say its the same as the other wellknown mic that looks the same but for my ears and everybody else whos listened to this mic it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my SM 58 I just used it to play a show on Friday the 24th and it performed wonderfully The sound guy thought it was an SM 58 I will definitely buy a couple of the ES57s as well to mic up some amps Now things may change in a year if the mic doesnt hold up but it is hefty and solid and seems to be built like a tank Now if I was dripping money maybe I would stick with the industry standard but when you can buy these at a 31 dollar ratio why on Earth should I262014 update I must say that in some venues youll really have to tweak the EQ in order to stop feedback So while they are a great value they feedback in some situations where my Sennheisers do not but they were 4 times the price Extremely surprised,positive
This pedal is awesome I use it the most of all my pedals because its pretty much perfect I can get 4 completely different sounds out of it Its also truebypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off Its much smaller than the big muff pi which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard Just to let you all know this is NOT an overdrive or distortion pedal It is a fuzz pedal So dont buy it expecting overdrive Also when its turned on you will hear a hum but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights and muff pedals hum alot None of that makes me dislike the pedal Its one of the hest fuzz pedals ever I use it in front of a wah and thats all Ill ever need to use pedalwise Get this pedal Most incredible pedal ever,positive
Im pretty new to using mics and PA systems but have used dynamic mics in the past recreationally This condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic I was surprised when I took it out of the box It is as good looking in person as in the pictures Three things for the benefit of other newbs 1 I learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if youre going to use this for vocals since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it 2 This has a cardioid pickup pattern you dont sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic This should stand straight up on a mic stand paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it 3 It requires phantom power You need a PA that provides 48V power to use itWhen I first used this mic I tried singing into the end of it and couldnt hear myself very well Later in the evening I was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that I had to back away about a foot from the mic Then I remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand paying attention to the orientation of the mic It was so sensitive that I really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals I have a Rainsong WS1100 acoustic electric guitar I was playing and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly Other musicians were impressed by it as well I payed just under a 100 for it which I think is a great value for this product Awesome Mic for a Great Price,positive
Never used this seller or site for this purpose before Sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks They fit perfectly and I have used them on Strat and a Levinson Blade not forgeting my Ibenez Easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service This seller is worth supporting Thanks These are really the best,positive
I use this pedal all the time now even more than the DS1 Great chrunch for the buck From classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in Great Pedal,positive
I plugged it in the outlet Plugged it into my Fender Mini Tonemaster Amp I dont need to worry about batteries any more What I wanted,positive
For the price this lil guy does the job I got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables The pedal is somewhat cheaply made the jacks dont really seem to fit the housing so well but i do have it somewhat semipermanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue Great Price does the job,positive
They are well built and can hold almost any speaker system you throw at them I have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them He likes them too These stands really stand up,positive
gives a nice little boost on my blues jr however this is not a replacement for an overdrive pedal in my opinion just more of a boost wish it had a grippy bottom made from rubber vs a smooth bottom made from plastic works ok,positive
Lunar lander here we come This pedal will take your playing to the moon Its easy to use I recommend getting the 9v AC adapter to save on batteries and avoid the battery hassle Use the Crybaby with other effect pedals the uses are endless and fun I was playing some Born On The Bayou Creedence guitar the other day and wow It will build your music muscle power to try and keep up with where this pedal wants to send you A keeper not like pedals that have no lasting power this pedal has so much to offer over such a wide range of playing styles Its right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time Im sure Ill be using the Crybaby for the rest of my music life Cry Baby Cry This pedal is essential to playing anything but straight guitar,positive
You cant beat these beefy thick cords for the price however some do have a flaw On some pedals and guitars they pop out cause the length of the metal shaft is too short so it doesnt click into the jack measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or soI go a razor blade and carefully trimmed some of the rubber insulation and that took care of the problem Minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar Very good quality for price BUT,positive
As with all Boss Roland products the Boss FS6 performs as designed I purchased it to control both my Boss ME 20 Multi effects pedal and my Fender Blues Jr amp The A switch in non latching mode allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my ME 20 and the B switch in latching mode allows me engage and disengage the FAT overdrive switch on my Blues Jr Amp Everything works exactly as planned The FS6 rugged compact fits right into my into ME 20 carrying case and easy to useI read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteriessomething to complain about As with most guitar players I dont use batteries in my effects pedals I use an 9 volt ACDC adapter Visual Sound offers the One Spot ACDC adapter kit that has a 9 volt battery snap connector adapter I removed the battery cover then using a small rat tail file I carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through I then put rubber feet purchased at ACE Hardware on the bottom to allow the snap connector cablebattery problem solvedI also use the FS6 as a sustain pedal for my Yamaha YPG 225 portable grand piano and a control for my RC3 Loop Station simultaneously The possibilities are limited only to your imagination It is somewhat expensive but it is a Great Product If you need a duel switch then I highly recommend purchasing the FS6 Great Product Works as Designed,positive
I typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great Never an issue No loss of tone Never breaks or fails Quality product for a good price Reliable and Great,positive
The industry standard for live performance the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason These are the only microphones that I perform with and the onoff switch makes it easier so I dont have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicingI just turn the mic off Industry standard for live performance microphones,positive
Update 9712Ok Ive been using these for a few weeks now and I have to say I keep going back to them They make the notes sound like bells Its holding up better than I expected I am a relatively soft player and Im adjusting to the stickiness mentioned below I am liking these more and more as time goes by Glad I tried theseOriginal ReviewRecently I got the itch to try different unique picks these the dunlop primetones felt picks metal picks etc I get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picksThese are interesting They perform quietly and give a more mellow tone They do however stick to the strings and it becomes difficult to use them will need some getting used to I wish I had ordered the hard version rather than the medium as these are a bit softer than I was hopingProbably wont be a daily driver but interesting none the less Interesting change,positive
Great bargain price 3 great vocal microphones in its own protective case with its own holders Not top end but for general purpose use and abuse works just fine Sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs Feels quite solid Great Vocal Sound Great Price Solidly Made BuiltIn OnOff Switch No Complaints,positive
I bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine There doesnt seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last They do what theyre supposed to do It Works,positive
These strings honestly arent for rhythm They bend too easily making rhythm playing impossible On the plus side for soloing you cant go wrong with these Honestly I would get the Hybrid Slinkys over these Weak guitar tone good for lead work however,neutral
Boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet Good for lead w single channel amps boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strengthespecially at lower practice volumes Should be INEXPENSIVE functional if not exciting,neutral
Good quality for the price It exceeded my expectations I expected something a bit more flimsy but was surprised to find it as heavy duty as it is Good Deal,positive
Im a gadget lover and this is a good one It makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap tofrom the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument A great gadget for your Guitar or Ukulele,positive
Got the black one Bought this to help hold up my heavy Sheraton II and needed something at least 2 inches wide and strong to do it On that level this strap succeeds It is definitely strong enough to keep my guitar from falling off or shifting on my shoulder It also looks very niceBut any positive thoughts I have about it are outweighed by the constant shedding of black dyed leather that continually falls off the strap and onto me my guitar my carpets etcI need things like guitar straps to be ready to USE without causing a shower of little leather bits all over the place I am not sure how long this will go on but Ive been using it for two weeks now and there is a trail of small black leather wherever I go I have not encountered the dye running yetHonestly if I had it to do over I would skip this particular strap Suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment Good Strap but makes a mess,neutral
I bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic Granted they are not the Hercules stands that I use but they work for my two other singers Great quality and I would definitely buy them again Highly Recommend,positive
I love this cable I dont get any buzz when I hook up my bass and it can handle anything I throw at it The sound quality is amazing The Best,positive
The material its made of is good and it holds the guitar The only things i dont like are 21Each of the corners has a cap The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off2The part at the bottom that looks like a U used to hold the guitar it spins It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straightI would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one Its not what i was expecting,negative
This is not just a tuner its a peacekeeper for our band Arguing over tuning can really take up time It works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached I do kind of miss the fights over whos in tune and whos flat though Excellent product though the metronome is of no value but thats not important We use it for guitars violins violas cello bass guitar voice training and ordering pizza who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill Super tuner love it should be known as the peacekeeper,positive
I was surprised at the sound that this amp produces The build quality is top notch Tuner is right on overdrive seems fine Im not an overdrive playerCons so far none and I dont expect any Surprise inside,positive
The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end My fender excelsior with its 15 inch speaker rattled the walls of its sweep and can give a very cool effect I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed Also the speed know has a great range with 5 second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones The depth knob does its job It doesnt have a manual knob to move the sweep but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so its no big deal For the price this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp Deep flanger but a bit touchy,positive
I have quite a few guitars and I like to keep them clean and polished This stuff is great for my fretboard and I use it every time I change the strings A,positive
Man this is perfect Some people says that the cs3 is noisy but I thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play if you dont have a independent circuit for your pedalboard theres gonna be a lot of noise most of all bcuz of the compression obviously For me this is PERFECT doesnt make any noise with my conections Tottally recommend this just perfect,positive
I purchased this for my sons acoustic guitar I was tired of finding it not in its case and lying on the floor or against his dresser Since he got this stand his guitar has been put away on it every time The security strap is a nice feature to make sure the guitar doesnt get knocked off the stand Great value for the money On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand with Velveteen Padding and Security Strap,positive
Okay here we go again what can be said about this roduct except that it works and does what it us supposed to Stand,positive
49 for a 199 microphone at Amazon May not be the best mic out there but for home studios this one marks the spot Get it if youre on a budget Not bad at all,positive
Ive been playing DAddario XLs in their standard 010 011 and 013 gauge sets for many years now so I was curious to see how these new balanced sets would feel I expected a more even feel across the fingerboard but experienced something quite different right off the B string felt a lot stiffer Looking at the tension table DAddario publishes its clear why this is the case In the traditional 01s the B string has about 30 lower tension that the E and G In these new sets the B is at the same tension which is to say its under 40 more tension than the B in the traditional set Thats a significant increase If youre used to the lower tension the balanced tension feels a lot stiffer at firstThe higher tension string requires a different amount of compensation at the bridge too which means changing the setup not easily done on a Telecaster where changing the length of the B changes the length of the E as well Being higher in tension the new B should require more compensation since itll shift pitch even more when you depressstretch it Since my Tele is currently set up as close as I could get the E and B to perfect comnpensation I didnt feel like playing with itAfter playing a while the set started to feel more natural to me I dont think Ill be changing gauges on the Tele right away as I have about a dozen 010s in stock as well as over a dozen 013s fro my archtop But I may experiment a bit with the new gauges for my Epiphone Dot Custom which I string with 011s Im wondering if the balanced sets will give me a more even stringtostring feel and if so it would be worth my effort to change over They do feel different,positive
Bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele the originals only lasted a week These DAddarios have worn quite well and still sound excellent Great strings Strings sound great,positive
I recently picked up aSquier Fretlessbass As with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired With fretted basses Id always liked strings with a little brassiness But roundwounds just didnt feel or sound right on a fretless Small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction And roundwounds just didnt have that acoustic sound There were quite a few choices for fretless strings but Ive always liked DAddarios on my 6string guitars These flatwounds were a perfect choice Theyve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings The bass sounds more like a real bass And the action is now so smooth I can use a small vibrato when I likeno longer restricted to the wide JacostyleThere are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds But theres something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of playerthe player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound As soon as I put these on I felt like I was home Perfect for my fretless,positive
These end pins are so simple and logical that Im surprised its taken the design process this long to get to this point I used to use Schaller straplocks but theyre not compatible with all straps If the end leathermaterial is too thick the lock wont fit I enjoy the elliptical endpin design as it helps me feel confident the strap will stay on but I can easily remove the strap or use another on the guitar I highly recommend you try this out if youre looking for a great way to keep your strap secured Great alternative to strap locks,positive
I normally use Dunlop8217s 060mm nylon picks but decided to give the 060mm MaxGrips a try when the price dropped to 300 for a dozenThe top half of the MaxGrips have a special surface with tiny ridges that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip The feeling is a little strange at first but you should get used to it quicklyI like the feel and playability of the 060mm Max Grip8217s but they are little more flexible than I prefer so if I were to get another set I would get a thicker type either073mmor088mm provides a firm grip but more pliable than the standard 060mm dunlops8230,positive
great price i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board very flexable and pretty good quality good product,positive
I just got it and tried it out Its not great but should work as a quiet practice amp You have to diddle with the gain and volume controls to get an almost realistic sound I would recommend this to anyone I like it,positive
We bought three of these and they are just great Mounting holes are drilled right screws pass right through and fit perfectly Comes with big beefy drywall anchors and feels just right Holds the guitar out at a safe distance Highly recommend this over the other way cheaper looking ones that are a few bucks less Spend the extra few bucks on these and SMILE Topnotch Guitar Hangers,positive

Good price Im a little concerned because when I first set it up the screen drooped down The flexshaft arm did not seem strong enough to support the screen in any position I was able to move it around and its working at the moment so Ill still rate it okay but I have concerns over the long run Good price Im a little concerned because when I,positive
Its works Nice and small Cool looking Does the job Seams sturdy enought Might even get a blue mic I use with a MoJave It works Nice size,positive
tremendous mic love the case and shockmount being all inclusivegot it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy homeportable studiolove recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic I run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear love it,positive
There are plenty of flashier prettier moderner looking or more nostalgic looking microphones out there Its all just so much marketing garbage These mics are the best mic for the buck out there Anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between this and far more expensive ones is blowing smoke up your a Industry Standard,positive
I am so in love with my 34pinkie34 I have been taking lessons using an electric acoustic guitar and I wanted to see the difference This has a thinner neck so you dont have to stretch so wide so its easier on my hands Its actually fairly light for an electric guitar and I went with it because its by Fender and it does seem to have that Fender quality for the price The only thing that I dont like is that it has a slight buzzy sound on the 6th string I will know better when I take the originals off but for now it wasnt a major issue Love with my pinkie,positive
The Dunlop Guitar Fingerboard Kit arrived very quickly and was put to the test immediately I am pleased with the product It makes my guitar look new again I will definitly look into their other products Thanks to Amazon for the quick service Great Kit for Guitars,positive
I LOVE snark tuners this not being the first one I bought nor the last I loved the fact that I didnt have to press all the buttons like the other ones Just get it relatively in tune by ear then this thing will help you with the rest My only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip It has already pulled up and I only put it on and off my guitar maybe 3 times so far I mean Ive had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad Im just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe I like it but the black rubber already came up,positive
These strings actually save you money because you dont have to change em much I keep em on a year or so and I play alot out door indoor constant abuse they never rust When they break I change emnowIm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change emthey really hold up There are better sounding strings yes But if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the toneThe tone isnt bad just not as good as a martin uncoated stringbut if you like longevity and less squeak these are great My favorite,positive
Got this to use with the Behringer compressor I ordered with this They are not indicated as compatible but it worked great Price was right I already own two and had no problems Quiet No hummmmm Buy it if you need a wall wart quiet as a mouse,positive
Lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job As the label warns do NOT to use on Maplewood frets mostly Fender strats due to the softer lighter quality It is only for the harder darker woods like mahogany which I have or ebony high quality ie expensive used best for fretless The solution is perfect but the applicator attached to the neck of the bottle could be better I would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100 cotton clothThis solution has been made specifically for use on guitars though I think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores Its only 4oz but what little is used each time this bottle should last the guitar owner hisher life Cleans real good,positive
Lets be very clear from the start The pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality The board is solid and the bag is very well made and will last a lifetime As other people have pointed out though Pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap Drings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder The only reason this is not a 5star review is because of the Drings That being said dont let that detract you from buying this I just feed the shoulder strap through the carryhandle and it works well enough Awesome board and the bag is great but,positive
As capos go this gets the job done at a good price Easy to use Doesnt seem to put undue pressure on the guitar Good capo,positive
I thought I would not have a problem with the length of the strap but low and behold it was just a little too short I like my guitar hanging low and this strap doesnt cut it in that department Still for the price I had to give it four stars You get a lot of high quality leather at a very good price just wish it went a little longer Great strap for the money but,positive
This is a nice tuner that works great nice part is it works on ALL stringed instrument I will tell you my 1st one did go belly up but Korgs awesome warranty covered it and my 2nd one works great This is the tuner you want nice tuner,positive
This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after For the price and product quality you cant go wrong with this one And the functionality is great Use it as a fuzzdistortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic Jimi Hendrix like tones and harmonics Solid little stomp box,positive

My bass had originalequipment Dunlops on it but they were silvertone whereas all my other hardware is gold And after 30 years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished So I knew it was time for a new gold set and I couldnt be happier with their look and quality I have used that other Sbrand on other instruments and really prefer the Dunlops The best straplocks available at any price,positive
I give this product a 5 stars in terms of the idea but a 4 or less in terms of the materials used to make it especial the outer plastic shell The cloth in the sandwitch which does the cleaning is a good and fare material All and all for the price its a 5 star Good idea to clean the strings especial metal strings without damaging them or the guitar itself Good Idea to clean Guitar Strings without causing damage,positive
I have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars I have 4 classical guitars 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string Its very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over Its a really great quality stand for the price They dont take up a lot of room and theyre very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if youre traveling I highly recommend itMy guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitars out because he said that if I kept itthem in a visible easilyaccesible place that I would practice more even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bagscases after each practice session I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room there they are I just pick any one of them up and start playing It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadnt realized that I always had the excuse that I didnt have time to practice but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesnt take up a lot of time for some reason kept me from practicing I guess out of sight out of mind But now I keep my guitars out and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music Im working on and the stand out Yes it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful Great stand for a great price,positive
As stated in the title this adapter is what you need if you use your Danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries You can now plug it into the wall As advertised it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so Ive owned it The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesnt seem too durable so because of this I have been very careful so it doesnt get broken You might be able to find an offbrand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the Honeytone so you wont risk ruining it Works great with the Danelectro Honeytone,positive
To me the stock 12 speaker that came with my Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue sounded too brittle Even if I messed with the presence and EQ knobs it just always accentuated the highs too much for me I had read reviews on this speaker and decided to pull the trigger and get one I havent regretted the purchaseI was hoping the improvement would be the same as when I put a 10 Ragin Cagin in my Fender Super Champ XD Wasnt the case It DID however fix the problem I purchased the speaker for My Blues Deluxe now sounds warmer to me and doesnt have that accentuated highend that it did before All in all it was a good upgrade and Id do it againSlick Took The Edge Off My Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue,positive
Wuhan makes great products for the money I have the 1834 medium crash and so I decided to try the 1634 both are great cymbals for the buck If you close your eyes you would swear you were using a Zylgian from the 60s or 70s Nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals With any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it the 1834 is a bit warmer than the 1634 the 1634 sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 1834 bought 4 Wuhans the 16341834 2134ride and a 1234 splash Will review each one as they come in from Amazon Why the 4 starswell its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close if your on a budget like I am go for Wuhans I have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years this is a really good product and excellent 1634 crash Wuhan really impresses me There are some great videos of Wuhans on You Tube you should really check those out before buying Wuhans or any cymbal for that matter I am very pleased with this 1634 crash Very Good Crash,positive
Best articulate bass string for the money I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued They sound great and stay in tune Sound like Rotosoundsthink Roger Glover Geddy Lee and Chris Squier Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick I am not a slap style player so I cant comment on that I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible Try them youll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy Loveem,positive
My only complaint is that it doesnt fold up smaller but otherwise this is an excellent stand I have to concede Im a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myK M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand However that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build The extra heft of the Hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand the KM tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor Despite not folding up quite as small the Hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust one action for legs one action for height whereas the KM has three separate legs and two vertical sections clamps I do realize that I bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the KM Length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the KM large enough that I wont try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as I do the KMIm also not convinced Hercules trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand The back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that its knock the whole stand over No big deal just more parts and weight I think I prefer KMs yoke as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied The Hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates Both work perfectly well with my Fender and similar bass head stocksIve had two of the KMs and the second was a bit of a disaster It was defective in more than two areas Defects happen but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit and lead me to try the HerculesI wont go into all of that here see my review on that product Aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke the Hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness Im glad I purchased this one and I think Ill get plenty of use from it But I should mention it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the KM mainly its awesome portability despite its slightly more fragile natureIn the interest of further comparison Ive got anUltimate GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Standon order and will review it against this and the KM as well I opted for the GS100 without an automatic closing mechanism over the GS1000 which has one for the reasons I stated above I dont believe it is strictly necessary The reviews of the GS100 are also more favorable and the GS100 is cheaper which suits my cheapness Stable sturdy easy to use,positive
Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys When I put them on I felt confident that I wouldnt have that issue anymore Its easier to strap up because of the quick release tab This should be every bassistguitarists best friend Life saver,positive
Received a new 500w Hartke 2x10 bass combo at church tube pre and ss power amp The preamplifier has one 12AX7 It was an EH It went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time After talking to Larry Hartke decided I got a bad tube He would not send a warranty replacement My suggestion new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation Replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like Dougs tubes tube depot eurotubes or some other reputable tube vendor I don t trust ebay tubes and wont spend the hard earned cash on NOS Replaced with a JJ but should have used a Tungsol reissue 12AX7 EH,neutral
to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise I sometimes play in a park or outside around the BBQ A must have A great tool,positive
I bought this becausehey a wireless mic for 13 Why not I might be able to use this in a public address systemthe connections all work and it makes sounds but the static is unbearable no matter how much I fiddle with different the adjustment screw in the receiver nothing works The audio is always clipped Dont even think of using this for music Overwhelming static and distortion,negative
These are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard I expect them to last for a long time really well made,positive
Well I love da Fender products always have always will I recently built me a nice custom strat and had been testing out a few of the various minitube amps out on the market lately which is where I would categorize this amp even though it has better tubes and more watts These are my comparison testing amps I own both of the 2 amps below and have also tried a number of others in the music store down the roadBlackheart Killer Ant 12 Blackheart cabinetVox AC4TV8 4Watt 8 Compact AllTube Practice Amp with Celestion VX10 Speaker also speakered out to the 12 Blackheart cabinetIve also tested all my amps in various ways by retubing them with a number of my collected tubesGroove TubesJJ TubesSovtek TubesSvetlana TubesTungSol Tubes goldand straight out of the box this thing beat them all of in sound quality even with what a lot of people are calling a cheap Fender speaker version I also plugged The Champ into my 12 Blackheart speaker cabinet and it sounded even better using my strat but I will do more speaker testing later Fender amps have always leaned to sounding better with fender guitars where as Gibson Epiphone type guitars really sound pretty good on the Vox and Blackheart modelsNow when this amp came out it was way overpriced but as always that price has fallin into a reasonable range I mean the price of all of these minitube amps are minimal in comparison to the nicer ones but again this thing is loaded with better guts so maybe that why it screams better yahoo me likey Better guts better performance plus Fender has added an extra range of effects and amp sounds Its small in size light in weight loud and easy to carry with you for jam sessions Always been a Fender man so now I got another one,positive
HOLD feature allows you to record individual tracks and overlap them on one another on the golive Dont get too ambitious though as the more tracks you add the more distorted the sound becomes I havent used expensive rack units etc but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses Excellent value Battery runs out fast so get an AC adaptor Great fun versaitile and fairly simple,positive
Ive purchased many of these cables and Ill be getting more eventually Cables even good ones eventually break These are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name If you need cables these work great good cheap cables,positive
I bought these for my music class The teens really liked the colors to choose from and I like the price Good Enough,positive
These strings are Great They Last for a real long time They even include free picks which is so cool I Defiantly recommend them for everybody else Strings,positive
Ive been using DAddario XL nickel wounds on my PBass for a long time They have a lot of tone they seem to last a long time and theyre not very expensive These strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds but are a lot brighter You get lots of overtones and high end from these The choice of gauges is a little different from the regular XLs too instead of the 085 A and the 100 E they have a 085 A and a 105 E Thats just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end and more metal to dig into while retaining low tension in the D and G Im more of an oldschool player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound but if youre into funk or more modern sounds you may feel that the bright SS sound is for you and if so these are a great string Very bright,positive
I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when I was thinking about buying it but I read all the review on it and decided to give a shot I figured for the price 3999 in late Nov 2012 that it wouldnt be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because I bought it to play around with while I visit my family in CA When I opened it I was pleasantly surprisedThe guitar came in great shape It was packed well and didnt have any damage on it The top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it but it doesnt affect the performance of the guitar It came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once I lowered the action on the guitar it was much easier to playThe sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight Overall Im extremely pleased with my purchase It sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much The pick guard looks a bit cheap but thats just nitpickingIf you want a cheap guitar that sounds great I totally recommend this one I am extremely happy with this purchase This is an awesome guitar at an awesome price,positive
Its well make and cheap compare with other product on Amazon nowadays market II do replace it for guitar cable work fine Im happy with this unit Recommend to someone need replace cable jct Well make good looking,positive
Elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my Guitars They are smooth and bending is a breeze They last longer than most other brands Ive used I use a little Finger Grease Spray and I would recommend them to anyone Amazing Strings My Favorite,positive
These strings have a powerful tone for lead work however theyre not on the bendy side which is great for rhythm work The tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm If you need an overall great set of strings get these You wont regret it Most versatile strings that Ive had on my guitar,positive
This is definately worth the money I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all Bought another one for my friend Absolutely awesome,positive
Not a flashy strap but great in the studio or on stage when you need to change guitars fastLight weight allows you to remove quicklyIt is pretty comfortable to wear also Flexablelightweight,positive
My band was playing out one night I use an amp stand that was on the stage I really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve its sound and decided I had to have one I started searching around and found this product The price was right so I took a chance and purchased one sight unseen The Musicians Gear stand does everything I needed it to It arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble Its light weight portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to 75lbs I would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less Great Amp Stand for small amps,positive
It does the job Its bulky but it works well It comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets or to use the tablet while still in the case works well but bulky,positive
I bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar I would have given this item 5 stars but even fully extended it is about 334434 too short As for the quality of the strap I love the look and feel of the leather It has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longerMy 2 cents in summary I think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric this strap would work much better If you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap Very nice strap but a little too short,neutral
A bit too soft but given the fact it does say made of suede you should expect it to be super soft Better for lighter guitars IMO Very soft but decent,neutral
This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice The enclosure is metal the knobs feel sturdy and the switch has a durable feel This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal Ive ever contemplated keeping I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal If you dont have a TS type pedal this is a good cheap choice Personally I didnt think it sounded any better or worse than my other TS type pedals Behringer TO800Joyo Vintage OverdriveDeltalab TO1TS808 and TS7 As I indicated I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy If you dont have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808 you may want to check this out first Great cheap pedal but a little redundant for me personally,positive
The strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set 01 012 016 028 038 048 are the perfect balance between weight and confort It fits very well on my guitars 1 Fender EVH Wolfgang 2 IBanez S470 The cons is that these do not come with VCI so expect some flakes when you open the pack I give it 4 stars,positive
I ordered this for my husband the musician He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel He would definitely purchase this productand hes pretty picky about his guitar strings Great Strings,positive
I have used Fast Fret for a number of years and think its a great product It now comes in a metal can and has a cap over the applicator versus the old plastic can with no cap over the applicator This is a much better way to package the product and will probably help it retain the lubricant longer Great product,positive
I have used these pads on numerous nonShure headphones like the fostex trp50 and the hifiman he500 and I have to say that these are by far the best most inexpensive solution to any headphone they will fit They ave made the sound quality better on each headset that I have put them on and they are softer and more comfortable than any other replacement pads I have tried in the price range Highly recommended Great replacement pads for any phone that they fit,positive
I have a Electric Bass Guitar and needed to Capo After looking at 34reviews34 I like this one the best Im very happy with it and it works great without any problems The size is 34Just Right34 not too small or Big Nice fit and Quality,positive
Every Guitarist needs a good tuner and everyone knows Boss makes some of the best products The fact is tho I really cant afford to spend 90100usd for a tuner When I received this unit I decided first thing I was going to do was to compare it to my other hand held chromatic tuners They all work the same Using this pedal I am able to obtain the same results thats good enough for me Activating the tuner takes a little over 23 seconds but thats fine since I usually tune within breaks and you hardly need to tune especially when you have a good guitartuning pegs Great Unit,positive
It feels great looks great and sounds great What more can I say If youre just starting out this guitar is perfect for you Once you get better at playing it you can customize it a bit more to your level of skill Highly recommended great for beginners,positive
I ordered this tuner so I could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag Its worked fine Ive used it to tune a ukelele a bass and a guitar and it works fine on all counts I have no complaints about it Good Little Tuner for the Money,positive
I needed a volume pedal of a smaller stature for my pedal case and this one fits the billANDits heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off Just what my pedal set up needed,positive
If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static nonoscillating chorus like effect its fine for that As an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful All the pitch shift settings sound like theyre 30 cents sharp This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it Its hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is Ive read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and Im also tempted to get their Green Mile pedalIf youre not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactoryOne minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips Ive tried to use The pitch shifting is out of tune,negative
First off most audio racks have that annoying 34slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them34 instead of properly sized holes Not this one Not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them but it even includes 48 screws so you dont have to try to figure out which of the 3 sizes youve collected over the years is going to fitI loaded it up with equipment and havent had a worry about it since Solid construction and the mounting just works This one is done right Great job of handling multiple pieces of equipment,positive
This is a very nice guitar strap in light gray The strap material and the doubleleather ends are heavy duty and should last a long time I got this at an awesome price too Ernie Ball Gray Polypro Strap,positive
This tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tuneIt is good deal for the money A little difficult to use,neutral
Very bright 4 of them are great for lighting up the front stage of a band which is my application for them Worth the money Bright Light,positive
Ive been using this product for many years It has always worked well for me I just spray a little on my hand and then rub the neck and strings and Im good to go Good product,positive
i love the design and the strap holds up very well i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol great long lasting,positive
This case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life Durable Protective Case,positive
I used this on my bass and I dont know what more you can say about it It works and does at it is supposed to I have no issues with quality or feel its too loose Does what its supposed to,positive
Reduces string noise as promised Makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise I think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers arent as irritated from sliding on bare strings Makes them feel kinda like elixirs but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel Also does make the neck a lot smoother I will be buying more for all my guitar cases Good,positive
It works This guitar support couldnt be simpler The neck rest is a molded plastic cup with that soft spongy material inside the neck support The mat is a thick light weight foam mat a bit like a yoga mat with a hole cut in it The neck support cup goes through that hole Thats it for set up The mat protects the guitar body The support cup holds the guitar at exactly the right angle to work on it change strings adjust the truss rod work on the pickups or clean the guitar The guitar can be placed in strings up or downThis wouldnt be a difficult DIY project but Id be missing out on that cool Fender logo if I made this out of wood and a yoga mat Honestly this looks really sharp put togetherThe whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube That tube is an excellent storage tube Sturdy and It Works,positive
I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P90 pickups I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed They had some great 34spank34 and sounded great Easy to play they almost seemed thinner than advertised they play like 9s but sounded like tens I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound I suspect they will sound and play great Nice strings,positive
I have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings 456 within 3 days of installing I play professionally and have a lot of experience installing strings nothing wrong on the guitar Hopefully the next set will be better String going dead right away,neutral
I have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps This fits just right and looks just right Its well made and not too expensive I just wish I had found them before buying all those guitar straps Its the right size,positive
I had looked around for strap locks for my Dean Dime Razorback and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them My guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damageThen I saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation I installed them last night and could not be happier They are very solid and the lock is positive so you can feel the click when it is set I am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well This is a great product at a good priceNote If you are installing on a Dean Razorback or ML the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate body into the neckDO NOT USE this to mount or pull the old strap mount off and return the screwit is too long and will likely split your neck Just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it it can touch it even and still function properly Enjoy I really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and dont worry that I will hurt my favorite guitar Perfect for guitars if straps are on the back of the body,positive
Ive been using a standard size Pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the Velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit I use it to keep 3 pedals in place a Line 6 M5 a Seymour Duncan Twin Tube Classic and a Live Wire AB Switch The first two are pretty heavy and bulky I needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case being carried vertically with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of themI decided to try out the PowerGrip and have been extremely impressed First I stripped the old Velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly It all came off pretty easily I then applied one strip of PowerGrip to each of the bottom 2 panels on the Pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals I then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommendedAfter attaching the pedals I was amazed at how well everything was secured The pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metalonmetal abrasion However you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhereI also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around with some effort and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bitThe grip also bonds to itself unlike Velcro where youre keeping track of male and female tape when replacing itI would recommend following the manufacturers instructions and applying this stuff to clean hard nonporous surfaces Ive heard that the adhesive doesnt work on rubber wood etc Many pedals have rubber padding feet on the bottom but Ive had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape onYou will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides Get a few rolls as a meter doesnt go as far as youd think Far Better Than Velcro,positive
I am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar I got the natural finish and I am blown away at the beauty of this thing Mine arrived in perfect condition Will only need a minor setup The intonation was surprisingly spot on and the strings are actually alright to practice on for a while If you are looking for a great quality strat for under 90 bucks then dont hesitate and order one of these babies How Do They Do This,positive
This has become my number one cable for my Carvin bass I gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid I only use something different if I need a longer reach And I love the tweed cover Very satisfied with this one Great cable,positive
One of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune With this little gadget there is no guess work Clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune I love this little gadget and the price is super on Amazon No more guesswork tuning my guitar,positive
I hadnt thought about it before buying these bridge pins but metal pins apparently add a bit of brilliance to the tone of my AlvarezYairi guitar so its a great bonus I bought them because my original plastic bridge pins were snapping and I didnt like the plastic ones available at a local music store Im very happy I bought them Great looking and they brighten the sound too,positive
First off lets get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the DR212 on the Epiphone web siteLength 43 Bout length 1978 Lower bout thickness 434 Lower bout width 1512So now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into itThe only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the 43 length Most bags are 3941You can always opt for the Epiphone hard case EDREAD or World Tour RWG20D or GBA100 the bag I gotNow that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the reviewAs my title says the guitar reminds me of my Samick ST92 which is a VERY well made 34 Spruce top acoustic which is also made in IndonesiaI have played guitar for over 40 years so I have a collection of over 100 guitars and 11 of them are acoustics but this is the first12 string and I bought it just to have it around for songs like Hotel California Etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar I would rarely useI am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under 17000 asking price It tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out You constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure The bridge plate on these 12 strings must be hugeI found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you dont hit the large one right next to itI have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which I likeThe nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of thatThe strings are not that bad and will do until the first change outI have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one I have is the later Love it Reminds me of a Samick ST92 build,positive
I love this wall hanging mount Of course you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud or use drywall backing screws etc but thats just common senseThe actual product works perfectly and exactly as described The arms are adjustable stay where you put them This fits my 5string Fender Jazz Bass as well as my acoustic guitar violin and even holds the neck without touching the pegs if you want it to I will be buying more of these for my other stringed instrumentsThis is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to Works Great Even Better Than I Expected,positive
There are two ways guitar strings go bad If you leave them on long enough the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode but that takes months if not more Before that happens grease from your fingers dust bits of skin and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings between the windings This interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound Back when strings were a lot more expensive some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them some bass players still do Coated strings are a simpler alternativeThese strings and similar ones like Elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings which accomplishes two things First it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap which prevents rust and corrosion Second it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings The strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings They do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings but its not a huge difference and after a month or two they still sound the sameThey also cost about twice as much as equivalent noncoated DAddarios Are they worth it That depends If youre an active performer maybe Youre probably changing strings for every performance to make sure youre getting a bright sound Youre probably also buying your strings by the box Theres no real benefit to these strings Where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy These days Im strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year I have four acoustic guitars and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played With coated strings I can leave a set on a guitar and a month or two later I can pull it out of the case and its ready to play I still change strings if Im going to be playing in public but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house these are great A little pricey but worth it,positive
these cables are nicely constructed i bought them for home use only home recording or just practicingthey seem to work well so far i wouldnt gig with these on a regular basis but for home use with littleabuse they should last well made cables for general use,positive
it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs It works as a beginner tool but only that mono only not what i thought,negative

Bought it after read reviews I had signal loss using these cables its like having a loose connection inside the cable My connections were on and off I thought I had a dead pedal I have to wiggle and hold to get signal Its too flexible almost like Twizzlers no kidding If you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables go get the one from Pro Co I bought it very cheap from Sweetwater on Ebay surprisingly very good quality and looks durable Crackling cutted out signals,negative
Ive always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work Danny Gatton did so and I wouldnt have it any other way These are the absolute best picks Ive ever used They dont wear down as easily as delrin tortex or some other materials And these have a really really nice textured surface that keeps them from slipping out of your fingers I think Im going to order these in massive bulk quantities and stash them away in case they ever decide to stop manufacturing these Best Jazz Pick Ever,positive
nice strap i meant its just a basic strap so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far should last a while with good care great strap,positive

I purchased this pedal with good expectations However my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged I tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained Overall the pedal sounded descent for a 30 pedal but I could not handle the frustration I traded and another joyo for a Ibanez stereo chorus It WAS okay,neutral
This product is excellent Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue Made my little Martin look almost as good as new Great Product,positive
It connected well in the nady smpsx1 phantom power unit I bought Ill update how I hook it up Check Good cable,positive
I use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great Its got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too Battery lasts for months Well done Behringer Great little cable tester,positive
This is the best cleaning product Ive ever used Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards but I also use it on the headstock if its unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant beautiful and lively tone Really brings out the beauty of true wood Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new Application method is also very useful I dont know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards I put it on my Stratocasters maple fretboard and it looks beautiful The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell nowhere near overpowering and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood Great stuff Go ahead and buy it Best guitar cleaning product out there,positive
The benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life This is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural life ie that brightness that new strings have The drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity stringsSo are these any good Yes they feel great not overly slippery or coated and sound great though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings Im excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player I change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longerAbout gauge These light strings go from 012 to 053 as compared to my old Martins which went from 0012 to 0054In summary Daddario makes good strings and these are no exception If youre looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted as opposed to aggresive tone with lighter low E then you should check these out Good strings,positive
I use 2 to stereo mic my egnater works great nice sound to my ears not much different from an SM57 and is a fraction of the price Its not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me Too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead Best value for money,positive
I really like the mediums They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough What I expected,positive
OK I just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago I did a little comparison to a pretty old SM57 that Ive have since 1990ish and it was actually very good The Pyle has more gain then the old 57 and as for sound I would say they are damn near identical to my ear I did the AB test by micing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mics in the very same positions I would recommend for sure Heres a link to an AB comparison I did with an SM57 Great bang for the buck,positive
Wow you would have thought this was the Holy Grail when it arrived at my house My son practically ran to the UPS man when the truck pulled up He is thrilled with this guitar Great purchase Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar Vintage Sunburst,positive
I was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after I tuned it and began to playMy guitar is absolutely beautiful The finish is flawless And its got that new guitar smellahhhhhhIt does have a pick guard that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog which pleases me It would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick I read one review on a music vendors website where the reviewer complained about Takamine and Jasmine printed all over the pick guard And they were right about thatbut I found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker DahThe strings are a little heavier than I like but Ill be changing them in a few weeks anywayThe sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything youd expect to pay more for It has a rich full bodied soundI am now a diehard Takamine fan This guitar DOES have a BIG SOUND for a small price,positive
For a Fender licensed product the build seems a bit on the cheap side the plastic is kinda dollar store quality but this tuner tunes very well comparable to more expensive Korgs or Snarks The screen is bright and while it does not change color the dial is easy to read Buy a couple and leave one in your guitar case and another one in your car so you can always tune up for those unexpected performances Never be stuck without a tuner again,positive
I left my trusty Manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when I came upon this alternative offered by Amazon As banged up as a Manhasset can get from weekend warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home Ive never had one fail on me over the past 40 years Theres nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension preventing 510 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward But the rub is their nonadaptability The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music Consequently these ubiquitous wellproven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan especially with a couple of keyboards amps instrument stands and other requisite gear on boardThis is where Amazons OnStage Music Stand becomes attractive of course it doesnt hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music Consequently its much easier to find a convenient placewhether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seatfor packing the stand Simply slide it into positionThe drawbackapart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about be careful not to overtighten those setscrewsis that this thing is heavy Frankly I was expecting a lightweight stand at least compared to my old Manhasset but if youve owned or been around the latter the first thing youre likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable substantial addition in weight At the same time with the moving parts and the set screws topped by plastic rotating serrated wheels the OnStage stand doesnt give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhassetin other words Im very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gearpile after a long exhausting 4hour gigBottom line the OnStage appears to be a good valuea truly heavyduty stand in most respects thatll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs But dont expect it to lighten your load or simply because its heavier to last longer than a ManhassetIf you do a lot of traveling and dont plan to put one of those 1000page piano folders on the stand theres at least one truly lightweight albeit plastic stand thats worked out really well for me perhaps needless to say some haventthey fall apart or theyre so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving pintsized cases But the Peak stand is made to hold up in turn it holds up relatively heavy music books and has served me well for several years just as I was about to condemn the stand I called the company they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped and the Peak stand has been problemfree ever since Itll cost you a bit more but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds A tradeoff but possibly a better traveling companion,positive
great little pedal Has a nice set of adjustments to give a wide range of delays and echo to your sound Easy to use very low price classic sounds I wish I had 4 ears so I could buy another one Strictly home studio use havent tried gigging with it though it seems pretty sturdy it is plastic but pretty solid plastic I also have a Danelectro Fab Echo and this just blows it away The Danelectro is okay but it just doesnt have the depth or adjustment that the Berhinger pedal has delicious delay for those notes you want to hear a little longer,positive
i got two sets of these tunners my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now i love them wow,positive
I just installed these on my Chibson LP from overseas I had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger I took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards not forwards by hand slowly until it was perfect I also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case I slipped Took me about 15 hoursThe ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance Really close but they were terrible in operation I have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar Havent played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goesUpdate Played for a couple hours First thing I notice is that they are geared lower than the old Chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars You tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly Which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustmentThis fixed the Chibson tuning issue Ill order another set for my other ChibsonAlso I have two Epiphones I believe these are nicer than the EpisSo I bought based solely on the reviews here I wasnt disappointed In fact I am pretty impressed good replacement for iffy tuners They worked for me Chibson owners,positive
I am a confessed and unrepentant hoarder of dirtboxes and I like this pedal a lot This is my 5th Joyo pedal I already own the Ultimate Drive Vintage Overdrive Crunch Distortion and Octive Fuzz pedals I consider Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line to be some of the best values in stompboxes these days Youve already heard the particulars about this pedal so I wont go into the features The build quality does appear to be a hair shoddier than all my other Joyo pedals which are earlier versions The switch seems a little less heavyduty and the case seems to be thinner metal That said the case is still metal and isnt going to fail in any way The switch well we will have to wait and see For 35 or so Im not going to complain Soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level Its not particularly suited for Pantera but you can do modern midgain up to Metallica without any problems This is not an overdrive so it doesnt do the just on the verge of breakup thing like a tubescreamer does Thats not what it was designed to do I run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good Ive also boosted it with the following with a good result SD Pickup Booster Cool Cat Transparent Overdrive Tubescreamer TS9Joyo Vintage OD Behringer TO800 Tech 21 Comptortion If you play rock hard rock through a single channel amp like a Blues Jr Valve Jr or Pro Jr and you want to make it a two channel amp this will get you there Most people compare this pedal to the Suhr Riot I do not own that pedal so I can not fairly make a comparison I have seen several videos comparing the two and as far as that is concerned I hear enough similarity that I am not compelled to shell out 200 for the Riot Another comparison that gets made is that the US Dream is close to a ProCo RAT I own an original 80s RAT and I dont think they are all that similar The US Dream has a tighter low end and more treble Not better or worse just different enough that they dont completely cover the same sonic territory Admitedly I dont own a newer RAT maybe that one is closer to the US Dream For what they are charging this is another home run for Joyo Five stars for this amout of joy for so few dollars,positive
Ive uploaded customersupplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is When you factor in the price its plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain but a flexible platform for mounting componentsOne other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a tabletop only rack They work very well on the floorThe rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank I have a bass amp head and a power amp plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that combined weighs around 50 pounds The rack is not stressed or strained by this weight and could probably hold another 50 pounds safely and reliably Another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components eliminating that expense I was expecting to have to orderRaxxess Rack Screws With Washers Hardware Pack of 25 which turned out to be completely unnecessaryMy only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problemIf you need portability reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved such as setting up on stages this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment I am so pleased with mine that I intend to purchase another one bringing the total to three Perfect for musicians on stage and in the studio,positive
This is a greatsounding reverb pedal Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound Ive combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II semihollow body and have been able to get some awesome deep rich sounds watch out for feedback though The design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use Honestly I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I wont use very much but theres no problem with them being thereI definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon U2 etc Or if youre just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones this is it This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar My only caveat to this review is that I havent tried out other reverb pedals but this one definitely suits all my needs Great sounding reverb,positive
This pedal sort of let me down a bitI really cannot find a musical sounding adjustmentI can hear a small amount of octave when I adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switchIf this was more of an octave pedal I would have been entirely more into the way it soundsI kept it because to be honest it is very cheapWhy bother sending it back It is a very good paper weight and I have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with itLets face itIf someone breaks into my house I can whack them on the head with it and knock them outI just cannot get any octave sounds idk am I missing something Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth Not too bad,neutral
I received a selection of pics for a reasonable price The variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options Handy starter pics,positive
It works well 95 of the time but sometimes has a problem with the G string for me I use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together theyre fail safe the snark tuner will also get buggy once in a while but together its so statistically unlikely that I dont worry about itThe stomp tuner also has the benefit of being able to hault the signal hence why I wouldnt just use a snark tuner Works well but can be buggy,positive
After registering the amp online or by mail you have access to 500 backing tuneswith either drums or drums and bassline You are able to select from different genres such as Rock Blues Country Alternative and more Along with this great feature you can also take free lessons from beginner to advanced You can even get custom settings giving you the sound of such great bands as Green Day The Beatles Led Zeppelin and many more Along with lessons tabs and the ability to loop any Jam Track Spider Online adds more than even I immagined to this awesome amp If youre still hesitant about buying this or any other Spider amp just buy it I personally guarantee your satisfactionBUY IT no seriously are you buying it Spider Online adds more to an already great amp,positive
I ordered two sets of these buttons to mount on two ukuleles a concert a tenor The buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install The inclusion of the felt pad is important dont buy buttons without a padDrilling holes in your instrument might be a daunting thought but take it slow careful and you shouldnt have trouble Check out this rather entertaining howto video to see the installation process For these particular buttons I used a 18 drill bit for the pilot holes Snug fit but IMO not too tightI matched these buttons with this strapKala KSTPBK Black Ukulele Strapfor a perfect combination Just what you need,positive
Good grip but too flexible and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks Probably good for strumming but not good for lead Too flexible,negative
I ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised They are excellent quality clear tone and a great look I was actually impressed with the room that the cables gave my tone and the clarity they have For Price and Quality these are top notch GLS 20 guitar cable,positive
With a nice clean crisp sound inexpensive price and durable history Ive made these strings apart of my acoustic set Ive got at least 6 spares at home right now XD Favorite,positive
Not much to say about this one Its a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well Genuine fender,positive
Not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap noname Japanese knockoff I play mostly hardrock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some techmetal and progrock for solo projects where Im playing pretty fast and sometimes hard They also handle detuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like DADAAD they are clear with good sustain Switched to these for the last 3 sets,positive
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam I didnt run it without this power source that seems too ghetto they should just jack the price to what it would be with this and viola but what do I know sad they dont include this with the tascam,positive
These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more brilliance to the tone The case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired it doesnt feel very solid But I intend to use this more for recording than live use so Im not worried about that Anyway there arent many EQs on the market and for the price it cant be beat I would recommend it Good flexible EQ,positive
This isnt the best power supply available It doesnt truly isolate each input The description says the outputs are 34isolated34 but what this means is that they are independent that is if one input has a short in it that one will cease to function and not the other working inputs So the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is notThis can cause some issues with noise but there are other things that can cause noise too Its not always just the power supply making the noise It could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors A power conditioner will sometimes help as wellHowever the Joyo provides plenty of powerenough for 89V inputs and 1 each of 12V and 18VIt is dependable solidly built comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards I have 12 5 x 3 pedals on my board with 2 of these Joyo units and my board is about 26 x 14There is some noise but I dont attribute that just to the power supply It takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down Im not sure it can ever be completely eliminated but the Joyo itself seems to produce very little and its a third to half the price of the truly isolated units and a definite step up from a daisy chain It also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off Dependable small size big power,positive
This is not the fanciest cable you can buy but it fits my low budget It works perfectly it doesnt feel like its going to break anytime soon and my pedals are perfectly connected Decent connector decent price,positive
Works great with my Fender Super Camp X2 Easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response Small light and compact Great product Small light and compact,positive

I love these clipon tuners I have several but this is the first one I purchased that is a bit of a pain because there is not angle adjustment for viewing it easily I have to move the guitar neck to see it right and that makes it inconvenient Hard to see angle,neutral
This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks in there because I live in a northern desert Not many frills to this bag It does the job Does the job,positive
I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolinsThey attach to the wall with 2 screws Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall It takes about a 14 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plasticThe piece that touches the guitar has some sort of siliconerubber which protects the instrument The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you haveI have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached againVery sturdy well made product Great product,positive
I got one of these a while back and being like I am with guitars took it apart to see just what its made ofMahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body insideKinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go thereOtherwise decent build basic original lp design bolt on surprisingly good electronics w full size pots and open back 3 way toggle good neck but bad tuners Note any 45 mount tuners meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 oclock position respectively Will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had So add 10 to get more than 30 minute in tune play hereAnd you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin withI like the style and though theres plywood involved still good fit and finish though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are only in looks Electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are importantI dont like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keysYou lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do thatIts likely theyll keep this style but revise it some to be hardwood body and real tuners as I think the price point demands it Otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups But Not mahogany,neutral
The warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way Id hoped I could not be more pleased with this product It actually delivers much more sound than I expected A true acoustic amplifier,positive
i own two of thesethe first did not have a compartment doorso things just roll around inside casenot happybut this one is just finelooks greatno i would not take it on tourbut as far as run around and taking lessonsits safe all latches match up wellenjoy will order again very nice caselike the compartment,positive
OK I am a pro musician rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal one of the first to hit the market of which I did not use much basically due to its used for certain songs I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit decided to buy the Boss CH1 Super Chorus to add to the collection After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but I have found through my 40 years of playing that more money is not always betterGreat tones Easy operation And it is the best bet for the money Boss is Boss,positive
I bought this to use primarily with my newly bought Ukulele but it also works perfectly to tune my old acoustic guitar too The display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate I wish Id bought one of these years ago instead of tuning my stringed instruments manually by ear Until now Id assumed I tuned my instruments perfectly well but this unit proved me wrong both my Uke and guitar sound better after being fine tuned with thisThis little gadget saves time improves tuning accuracy and is absolutely perfect for the job it is designed forIt comes supplied with a CR2032 battery and a basic protective bag to keep it in when not in use A product that becomes indispensable from the first time you use it,positive
Yes this pedal is plastic the switch is not the most durable feeling and the knob placement is annoying At less than 15 you need to be able to look past these things Ive had a higher failure rate with the Dunlop Cry Baby and that thing is built like a cinder block This pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended Which is to say this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier No brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going No overdrive pedal lives up to its potential running into a solid state even modeling amplifier Its just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy Some have complained about RF interference with the use of the FAB pedals getting radio signals through your amp I have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the FAB particularly when running a long pedal chain Based on tone alone this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under 100 Check out the YouTube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by intheblues I believe he uses a DRRI with a strat and this pedal sounds GREAT If you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of 100 you may be surprised particularly if your other gear amp and guitar are halfway decent What I did note though was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other TS type pedals That doesnt make it worse or better just different The midhump is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer which is a good thing IMHO There are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market It will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers Incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes Since it isnt true bypass you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine Lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review Ive been playing guitar since 1979 and have used vintage dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced I am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear YMMV Great bang for the buck overdrive,positive
These help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board They snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality Just what Id expect from the company Pedal board essentials,positive
I really love this Tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product Recommended Fantastic,positive
Been using these for years They feel great last longer than any other string and most importantly they sound GREATThey cost a little more than other strings but theyre worth it Best Acoustic Strings Ever,positive
The quality is good the smell was funny when first opened I worry about Chinas lack of environmental concerns but the sound is first class very quiet so with my Rde NT5 matched pair I have a very quiet signal path Great sound,positive
Brass TacksThey are Velour They fit on the ATHM50 headphones That is what I wantedThey are not a perfect fit as they are MEANT for a slightly larger can but its more than snug Looks good tooRemember Because of the material you WILL notice a slight difference in sound ATHM50,positive
I bought this in 2012 to record music classes and workshops that I take in both acoustic fingerstyle guitar as well as electric guitar bass and percussion All of those environments are very different and require different approaches otherwise youll wind up with only mumbling or with the sound blown out The DR07MKII has worked well for over 100 classes recordedThis unit has been great for picking up the human voice about 20 feet away while it has been sitting on an extra tilted music stand With it set to auto level then I can take it to a loud percussion class or electric band class and it quickly adjusts itself to the environmentYou can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually Ive needed to do that for classes that involved a lot of lectures but then bursts of high sound I was willing to let the bursts clip so that I didnt miss the human speaking around themOne little feature that I now love is the fact that you can preset the file names and it uses them followed by a number to create next file I set them for certain venues that take classes or even a class name if I know that Im going to be taking only that class for a few weeks This makes it easy to copy to my PC and keep organized Great for music classes,positive
This is the perfect fit for all my basses I have two Ibanez and two Essex basses They recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge I play fingerstyle and they feel great They have corrosion resistant packaging and since corrosion is what kills your strings the longer you can keep it at bay the better They are made in the USA and they use recycled packaging I cannot attest to their lifespan but the package says long life so we will concede that point Just my size,positive
This mic works better for some people than others That being said it is the first mic I put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them If it doesnt sound good then I try something else I have no complaints it is my GO TO MIC Good all around vocal mic,positive
I want sure I would like this thing when I ordered it but it was cheap enough to try I dont like using it as much as I thought I would but thats just me The device works as advertised Over a long period of use I think it might leave a mark on the sound hole even though the hook is padded Does the job,neutral
I have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex space and noise is an issue As a beginning guitarist I contemplated a small amp but decided on the Mini Tone Master because in my apartment the smaller the better Also I had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that I am I just wanted something nofrills that was small compact with enough quality sound to help me as I practice The Mini Tone Master delivers wellI was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone It does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery Battery life is also pretty good Ive had the same battery in there for several months already playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so farIt is a little frustrating sometimes as another reviewer mentioned to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling I found a setting that was acceptable to my earsWhile I didnt need volume this little guy can be loud No weakness thereI also plugged an acousticelectric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well a beginning guitarists review,positive
I bought this for my new 12 string Guild acoustic I use Oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them The reason I tried this one is because its necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them And with 12 strings it really put a lot of tension on them Another difference is there is nothing to do with the Planet Waves You slip the included packs 2 into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings They should last 34 months you dont do anything else Also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock With others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they dont dry out I also used a Dampit but because it hangs from a cord it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acousticelectric I may eventually replace my Oasis humidifiers with these also Humidipak,positive
Good quality bag for my Epi LP Fit like a glove in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories Fit my Epiphone just fine,positive
Thank you Fender for a really fun instrument that fits my sizeand thanks to all of you that recommended it for just that reason Hoorayit fits me,positive
This guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck Also the 34pick pocket34 is only useful when the strap is around your neck When you remove the strap any picks in the pocket fall out It is OK definitely not great Very Stiff,neutral
These straps are very good at a low cost I actually like them better than a few highpriced straps I have and they8217re lightweight as well Well made,positive
The build quality could be better ideally the nut needs to be replaced the cut is a rush job and the neck needs to be reset theres a gap that indicates that the pocket wasnt completely cleaned out when it was put on but what do you expect for this price It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if youre willing to invest another 50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for ayoung smaller player or anice travel instrument mini strat,positive
Weak sounding and break very easily I would not recommend these to anyone other than those who literally have no callus developed Nope,neutral
I read some mixed reviews about the unit but I8217ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine Seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price Seems accurate,positive
Its the same as the other flavors which all work fine but it looks great with my new white Gretch Looks good with my white guitar,positive
I purchased this amp locally and initially I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds This was my first Fender amp as wellThe presets were neat and all but when I played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how its clean sound was the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on Ive never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts This isnt a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond its clearly a defect with this product Dirty presets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume Youd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticyhiss at LOW LEVELS WTFThe next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e After striking a string instead of a clean note theres a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayableThe weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in but Im not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12 Celestion speakerRead the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitaramp related websites theres a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting and youll find that these amps are having issues Apparently the Mustang I and II dont have these issues and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp Is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue There is speculation that the LCD screen which is not present on the I or II may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesnt seem to careDefinitely try this before you buy it You may get an amp that doesnt have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds goodThis amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage I am disappointed that Fender hasnt yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong but Im not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrongWhatever I took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the builtin noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead Guess what The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz even when cranked How about that Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noiseIll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that Id like to try But before I buy another Fender amp Ill take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds Fizz and noise issues,negative
I have two sets of these for my straps The push button action is most convenient vs fighting stubborn leather openings especially if new The gold finish matches my instruments hardware and they are sturdy and durable Works for me Great Locking system,positive
These guitar strings are nothing special and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be They work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh shiny set of new strings For playing they sound pretty good Best part in my opinion is that theyre made in America as well as the majority of Fender products If you want to spend the extra money Id stil recommend Ernie Ball over these or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these Fender strings You get what you pay for As far as shipping Musicians Friend did a great job getting the order out quickly Ill be ordering from Musicians Friend again Average strings but great price,positive
Received item when promised fits great for my Yamaha Acoustic Electric but carry with care remember Acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped great zipped pockets Acoustic Gig Bag,positive
These picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction Its easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks give them a shot nice pick,positive
SUMMARYIf you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time when you restring They are just faster and easier Overall this is a really nice convenience upgrade on guitars and its not very expensive to do Fender uses these on the American Deluxe and once I got one I had to have these on the rest of my stratocasters Because they save time restringing you are more inclined to restring frequently which means you sound better Fresh strings can do a lot for your soundIve put these on several guitars I have and always appreciate them when changing strings At instalation be aware these are staggered height tuners so be sure to put them in the correct holes see below These are drop in replacement tuners for most modern MIA and MIM Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters that use a Shaller style tuner Fender makes these relatively cheap now in chrome although I wish they would make them affordable and available in a gold finish Ive seen also seen nickel and black and they make gold but hard to find and rather expensive something like 120 a setFUNCTIONPURPOSEI think people believe these somehow give you more stable tuning or something but that is actually not their purpose Proper use of a traditional nonlocking tuner is just as stable Some folks dont actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they dont get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and dont string it correctly For those folks these will elimiate the resulting pings and such But their intended purpose is to speed string changes I believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect A locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning and thats why you always find them with Floyd Rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing But locking tuners are not really for that purposeFIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit these have 2 little pins on the backside If you are considering a replacement make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you dont have to drill the back of the neck the tuner bores in the headstock or use inserts If you want to use these but dont have the little alignment holes Stewart Macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes Its expensive about 40 but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts It is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig and even with the jig easy to be slightly off These fit most newer FENDER stratocasters and teles both american and MIM and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those casesPull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change If you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount Maybe buy and inspect with the knowledge you might have to return them There is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isnt it look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg holeTypical neck bores for tuners by brand are shown on the warmoth site at These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands For FenderShaller tuners its a two step bore with the main portion being 2564 and the rest at 1132 Vintage style tuners use 1132 Gotoh and Grover use a two step 1332 to 1132 Sperzel uses 2564 Planet waves uses 1332Of course if you are mechnically inclined have the tools and dont mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar Sometimes that means using inserts or bushings or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw or for alignment pins in different locationsbut the best answer is to use a tuner that is a dropin replacementWhen installing be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners These are not all the same length they have staggered heights 3 long and 3 shorter I think I have also seen some sets that are 42 but these are 33 Put the long ones in the EAD string holes and the shorter ones in the GBHighE holes If you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time,positive
This headstand works like a charm Its simple portable and sturdy Ps to the people complaining about it falling overI have no idea what youre doing with your guitars but mine is very stable Plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and Ive used just about every brand For the price you cant complain Best overall value,positive
If you need a cord and dont want to pay a lot this is a good one I was surprised howsturdy it appears The only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine great deal,positive
Ive almost exclusively used Earnie Balls and Daddarios since I was a kidand have always been satisfied Ive taken advantage of Amazon deals on both strings lately The Daddarios are excellent strings and this price on the 10pack was unbeatenanywhere good strings,positive
The perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar My daughter loves it Instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs Simple to install looks great works great,positive
Its fairly tough but flexible No noise that I can hear and the connectors look solidlymounted I would definitely buy this brand again Very decent cable,positive
This device works well but sound is far from perfect Distortion is more noticeable at higher volume For the price paid is a very reasonable option Good for the price,neutral
I guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when I put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two Sounded lovely for the first hour thats why two stars Granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but I simply cant recommend personally Ruined the action of my ukulele,negative
I ordered both this one and the Lee Oskar I couldnt find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the Hohner had 34raised34 ends I reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok The quality appears good The springs that hold the harp in are STRONG but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands I can change harps without removing the rackThis was my first shoulder rack and I didnt know what to expect I have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and its challenging but I can get it done I like it after I figured out how to make it work for me,positive
This mic is fantastic Ive been singing writing and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive German mics Ive used in larger studios over the years Theres a very slight presence peak but nothing like most of the other Chinese mics It isnt shrilling or peaky at all Male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for EQ whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff This mic is also an excellent candidate for a Michael Joly mod he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under 200 Michael mods these mics and youd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous U87 with the German name that starts with an N Im using it totally stock and its been great Buy it LOVE it,positive
This is a very nice way to get rid of all those wall warts and batteries for your pedals Easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path Simple effectiveworks as advertised The extra adapters are a nice touch Get one youll be happy you did Just what I needed,positive
As other reviewers have noted the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to click into the jack of your guitar or amp Easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about 18 then the cable is fineOther than that I like the cable construction and the large sized ends Good and bad,neutral
This pedal is awesome Not only does the DD7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay modulation and loop functions Its capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards This means their stuff is made to last No flimsy plastics cheap rubber or faulty components or parts will cut it in Bosss supieror product line The Delay Pedal,positive
I just put thePlanet Waves PWCT12 NS Mini Headstock Tuneron my Stratocaster last night It replaces several other tuners I have been using that hung off the headstock and tended to come loose and fall off or had to be constantly resecured and positioned and removedreattached when I transferred my guitar tofrom the case The mini takes care of all those problems I attached it between the low E and A string tuners inner facing with the display rotated to face me It is sensitive and accurate The display is quite readable even without glasses and features a color change to green when near or in tune There are fine tuning bars on either side of the note indicator so you know when you are right on I can leave it attached when I case my guitar which is a huge plus The battery is top loading so I dont even have to remove it to change the battery which probably wont be for a while since it has an effective autoshutoff function as opposed to other tuners Ive used that are supposed to shutoff when no audio energy present but dont and kill the battery Also the display is smaller and as such probably requires less power to operate which translates to longer battery life It can be turned on or manually turned off with a simple touch of an easily palpated power button The frequency is adjustable 10 hz from 440 if you need that for some reason It uses a clip to attach via friction which is adjustable and the clip is padded so it wont scratch the finish of the headstock I am so happy with this tuner I am buying TWO MORE immediately one for my Breedlove acoustic another to keep as a spare Every once in a while I happen across products designed to fill a specific niche that fill their designated need perfectly and this is one of them Tiny sensitive accurate,positive
Very good strings Five Stars,positive
I have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years I just keep coming back to these The sound isnt quite as bright as the phosphorus bronze but it is more of a acoustic guitar sound anyway These are clear high quality and come sealed in tight plastic so the strings arent exposed to air until you open them Because of that little difference they do stay clean much longer than the brands simply wrapped in paper I just cant think of a single complaint My favorite strings,positive
I have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body I had to trim them down To long,negative
I play using this device It is portable so I always have it with me I tune the A to 432 and this works well for that Has a tuner and a metronome Whats not to love Best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar unless you are in a quiet area It is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings This is a good thing its sensitive Works well,positive
Works fine It is of course difficult to tune when others are playing around you I found the mic tuner isnt as accurate Also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily It is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too Good tuner,neutral
I have several overdrive pedals some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD1 For a long time I overlooked my SD1 and used other pedals But when I went back to trying the SD1 I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using I dont mean merely that its very good relative to its price I mean that its very goodperiod It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about 45 on Amazon At that price its an amazingly good deal Note This is definitely an overdive pedal it will not deliver metal distortion at least not by itself If you want to ride the crazy train look elsewhere like Deltalabs Metal Distortion pedal What this produces is smooth oldstyle overdrive Its excellent It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus I plug my SD1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amps chorus the result is delicious Ive used the SD1 with both singlecoil and doublecoil pickups Both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker But it sounds great with singlecoils too A gem,positive
This On Stage ASFSS6 GB Dual Screen Pop Filter performs great and makes me sound professional I particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on targetAlso the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order A well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product Great Job On Stage,positive
Im using this footswitch to control a drum machine it does the job and ive had no problems with it it works,positive
I have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick Seen these and they work great when needed Looks good too Works great and lasts,positive
so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone I can not comment on this as I have never owned or played one What I can say with over 30 years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low priceI own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion See my other reviews on these pedals basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetweenIt is built solidly and looks roadworthy It has reasonably decent components and it sounds great Is it of the same caliber as a 150 boutique pedal no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price I WOULD HAVE NO ISSUE GIGGING WITH THIS UNIT The distortion is warm with the tone at 12 with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available Lots of sounds in this unit And very very quiet Nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense Much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned For classic rock this is perfect maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatOverall no concerns with this great product fulltone ocd clone,positive
This is a clone of the boss compressor and works just as well as far as I have been able to tell as the original being the owner of both I would have to say if youre not too stuck up about brands then I would go with this if you like the boss cs3 but many people say that bosses compressor is not that good I know some compressors do seem to be a little more natural sounding however that is just preference it does what it needs to chicken picking or just crispening up your sound its plastic but nothing is unbreakable so use some sense dont hit it with a hammer or JUMP on it and youll not break it Ive had no problems with behringer but heard great things The cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow sounds like its clone to me,positive
I own Dunlop Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos I dont like the direction the Dunlop faces it seems awkward The Kyser spring is very poplar but I think the spring tension is too strong making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp I like the G7th Nashville Capo but the spring tension is inconsistent The used to be softer maybe too soft but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better Just right,positive
This is a great little addition to both my violin and my mandolin While some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele no It doesnt work that way unless the sound hole is not directly over the strings If it is the pickup will mute the A string and its annoyingAnyway I digress The pickup adds a bright clear sound to your instrument without feedback or hassle Cherub violin pickup I like it,positive
If you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button these are great buttons to use It comes with two buttons two washers and 4 screws two different sizes Great Guitar Strap Buttons,positive
The monster chord is great looking but for me they are too stiff I play an acoustic guitar so I dont run around a lot The cord must be made to be able to take some abuse but I dont need that Not that impressed,neutral
i like it as the stars saygreat for around the house playingbut lately i noticed it does cut out on mewhen you strum it shuts down somrtimesi am not sure if it is the battery or it just does not like the song i am playingwhen you turn it back on it usally works finesome other people have made the same discovery alsobut for 20im going to live with ithas a belt clip if you want to look really silly playingi just glued it to my pelvis it work wellfun to have,positive
I had purchased a Peak violin stand but wasnt thrilled with the height of the violin bow holder the tip of the bow dangled just a bit too close to the floor for my comfort This being designed to hold either a violin or a viola allows more height and I feel that the bow is safer Additionally this stand allows my violin to be placed on it with the shoulder rest in place while the Peak stand was less secure unless I removed the shoulder rest So this stand is more versatile for a performing situation and for days at home when I want to have my violin handy and ready to play as time allowsWarning do not use any violin stand at all if you have a cat or dog which can come into the room where the violin is resting on the stand The stand does have a lock to help keep the violin on the stand but it would be very easy to knock the whole thing over if a dog or cat were in a playful energetic mood This stand is great for my violin and bow,positive
To be honest I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeths first album KIMB So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet but ive got close enough to it This pedal is great only a couple notes I should make about it Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock or just rock in general This pedal is for metal The battery drains like a MF I dont understand why The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal THE Metal Pedal,positive
Great feel to them and nice sounding They do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what I normally use I think I will try these in the super slinky Top quality strings,positive
Update 20130924Star Rating downgraded from 5 to 3 because the pick holder broke a rather thin and fragile plastic flap that helps to wedge the pick in place broke offThe Planet Waves Capo trumps myKyserin both speed and ease of use Its triple spring action provides the leverage needed for opening or closing it with much less effort and its every bit as wellbuilt as the Kyser It also has a couple of features that the Kyser lacks1 Integrated Pick HolderIm always losing my picks God knows how many picks Ive run through so the pick holder is a very very handy feature2 Tension AdjustmentWith the capo attached to myWashburnat the lowest tension my Gstring would buzz But at the maximum tension this capo has a stronger grip than the Kyser which makes for a buzzfree playing experienceThe Planet Waves Capo definitely gives the Kyser a run for its money For years the Kyser had been my favorite capo but having found the Planet Waves I find myself liking it more than my Kyser If you prefer a quickchange capo as opposed to aShubbstyle capo the Planet Waves Capo is well worth considering Easier To Attach Than A Kyser A Couple of Nifty Features To Boot,neutral
These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone Theyre also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others I would prefer if the B string were 0012 instead of 00115 and if the A were 0032 instead of 0034 As such I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way But if youre not too picky this will suit you very well Not bad could be better,positive
The NS Mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multioctave range of electric bass guitar and mandolin The accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency buttonThe tuners view window is slightly larger than a Chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimlylit spaces One thing thats less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself If youve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what I mean Id wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing a lighter color may work betterThe notes appear red when out of tune their color changes to green as a rough marker You then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note Theyve gone to lengths to make the tuner stagefriendly but Id much prefer the green color mean fine tuned and done That way I can look from a distance I should only have to bother with the bars if Im struggling to home in and in my experience thats the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by new strings slack under the bridge pins a slipping tuner etc Midlife strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably so long as you dont use a lot of altered tuningsThe NS is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back Im a lefty and unlike some other tuners I appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen rightside upThe viewer doesnt extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my L4 with large New Yorkerstyle tuners On headstocks with more bare wood like a Strat or even my Astyle mandolin it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didnt obstruct my hand while turning keysAt first I didnt like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock I could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like I needed two to remove it one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out After a little practice however I found this wasnt the case and the touch required isnt difficult at allThe tuners constructed in a highimpact composite similar to those parachutestyle clamps you see on backpacks It feels durable and very unlikely to break although I didnt try stomping on itI was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag The battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin The tuner has an autoshutoff function to preserve battery lifeThe power and frequency buttons are just nibs really Id prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them The tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from 430 to 450 if 440 doesnt work for youOne advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and arent limited to usually diatonic open strings For myself I only use tuners to set the pitch of one string usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin In my opinion tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics and neither does the job well Intonation is subject to a bunch of variables string action and thickness neck relief fret condition nut and bridge conditionOnce I have a single string to pitch I match fretted and open string unisons and octaves After a while you learn which combination works best for each instrumentI used to love staring at those Pignosesized strobatuners sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately I wish many more did Im not quite sure how we went from We tune because we care to Im so embarrassed to be standing here tuning I hope no one notices but the NS Mini Headstock tuner questionable design choices and all does what it says with a minimum of fuss Detects Pitch Well But Could Be Friendlier to Use,neutral
I never really considered a cheaper cable I was always taught to get the best I could afford When this showed up in a cable search on amazon I jumped on it I figured I had nothing to loseTo my surprise this is an excellent cable with good build quality and a strong thick jacket that inspires confidence The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables and it cost one quarter the pricehmmmm guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to 34snobs34 for so many years I will never do that againThis is worth the money twice over try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye Good quality low price,positive
As accurate and easy to use as the excellent Korg DT10 I plugged in the battery hooked up my guitar which I had just tuned using a Korg DT10 that I already own and it came up in meter mode and verified exactly the tuning that the DT10 gave me I love it Nice footprint very easy to see the indicators in a bright room or on a darkened stage one input 1434 jack on the right one output 1434 jack on the left Simple to use I probably will never use the other three display modes but its nice tht they are there if I want to play with them The perfect tuner The perfect tuner,positive

Ive been playing mostly acoustics over 30 years I own a D35 Martin Epiphone DR212 Zager ZAD50 American Fender Strat Gibson Studio Les Paul and have owned many others When my Little Red Traveler showed up at my door I was excited but my expectation bar wasnt set too high I unpacked the Traveler and gave it the once over WOW nicely made Neck was perfect just the slightest bow frets were finished better than my Gibson when I bought it I found some wetdry sand paper I think 200 grit and spent about 1015 minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone WOW 2 the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality no buzz perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play The tone is unique not quiet and unless you are expecting Martin sound definitely not offensive The sound is kind of acoustic guitarukulele banjo ish Im thinking with a nice pickup it would make quite niceunique a acoustic lead instrument Plays great to the top fret love it Unbelievable instrument a pleasure play Oh and the case is a 40 freebee Buy one be happy One last thing another post mentioned putting your right arm outside the strap and tying between the tuning keys that works well BABY IM AMAZED,positive
This was exactly what I was after I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals Great little cord,positive
I collect picks or plectrums if youre a purist and thats because Im trying to see how where I can use a new pick My first pick was a shark fin and I loved all of the ways you could hit the strings with those picks Now we have the BEEHOLD picksWhat I like about this pick is the stinger or the longer point to hit the strings with Sure the octagon hole in the center makes it less of a challenge to hold on to but thats not been much of a hindrance to me Rather this picks design makes it easier for my holding hand to hit the strings without my palms fleshy part accidentally touching the stringsI found running leads scales with this pick to be a delight I like heavier picks so I chose the 100 mm as that was the size I started off with from my first guitar teacher who recommended heavy picks Ive found this pick to be great for strumming rhythm patterns equally as well as for serious lead playingAnother thing is that with the design Ive found that I need not squeeze this pick as hard as I have to like I do with a Tortex pick and that makes playing so much more funOverall I give this pick 5 out of 5 stars will be using these for many years to come LOVE These Picks,positive
Everything I wanted and more I love the joyo pedals They are amazing and they dont break the bank awesome love joyo,positive
Excellent value for the money although not any more heavy duty than other stands I own Nice and stable for my classical guitar Excellent value,positive
I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy except distilled water In all actuality its a really simple designI like this design better because of one simple fact If the wood in your guitar is already dry youll have to refill your humidifier more often initially id rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers After the guitar gets hydrated I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days It definitely gets taken several time between refills so its not that much of a hassleOverall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother Try not to overdouse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitarPeace out and cheersJ The only refill you need is distilled waterIm in,positive
When I sit down to practice my guitar I just want something very simple to keep time It was a pain previously to have to mess with menus and such on a computer to bring up a metronome app from tablet phone or computer With this Ill just have to flip a switch and dial the tempo that I want Simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines I do recommend this one Simple,positive
Ive been using these for about 3 weeks now they are strong but flexible and dont seem to develop kinks or bending habits if you roll them up the proper wayIve seen and used some better cables but not at this price point And Ive certainly seen quite a few worse This is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion Very Solid Cables,positive
I had a custommade pedalboard made with wood also it was great in therms of protecting my pedals and with the space but maan it was heavy only with 7 pedals and that was getting me problems with my back and shoulders with this i have 13 pedals and i wont say that its not heavy bcuz it is but is the same weight but i got 13 pedals Thats a huge difference the only thing that i maybe dont like is the bag i know it wont last A LOT OF TIME but in general is the best pedalboard ive had and i wont change it maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain the best getting something better than this u cant,positive
I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over timeIve used Carnuba car wax many years ago and this is a much higher grade easier to apply easy to removeThere were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface They were very minor and did not affect the wood but this will seal them Not a sufficient defect to return the instrumentAnother reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal I have open tuning machines and before applying TriFlow with a pinpoint applicator I used this wax let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel The chrome is gleaming Theyre really beautiful Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed Also got the tuning pegs This is a 000 OM acoustic Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge I used distilled water so if someone left too much water possibly a problem but all worked fine for me Works well,positive
Well thought out unit that does what it says it will drop all that POP I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand And being that it is rubberized it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent 34give34 And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer allowing you to do what you do best Sing And then and now for the really important part everything stays where you last left it Hell even my cats cant do that and theyre porcelain Great POP Filter,positive
I just slapped one of these on my reliced 94 MIM Fender Strat It looks very slick Only issue is that it got scratched already after having it for less than a month Lookin good,positive
Honestly the strings are great They sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings I love them and they will be what I buy the next time I change out as well Highly recommended Really Great Bass Strings,positive
The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately exact easy to use fun to look at There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better The next 0 in instrument tuners,positive
I ordered this hard case for my Fender T bucket It fits exactly like an original fender hard case Looks like made of good materials Very well built With interior pocket to put your accesories like capo string winder etc I Love it For its PRIce and QualityI giving it a 5 star O Fits with Fender T Bucket,positive
This is a good microfiber cloth but I guess because its from Ernie Ball it costs more than other clothes But if you are like me its all about my axes I have one in each gig bagcase I dont recommend using with polish just a wipe down after each guitar or bass use Good polish cloth,positive
Wow is what my teenage son said when he opened this on Christmas morning He loved the variety number of picks A great deal,positive
Ive bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet They all work flawlessly Ill definitely buy more and highly recommend them Just like Schaller but Fender branded and cheaper Asian made Good Value,positive
Classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black 76 Tele custom Ive never had a complaint about a Levys strap theyre expensive but always seem to be worth what you pay for them unlike some other brands cough Fender cough Classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black,positive
A great add on to my student model for acoustic practising Always add those rubber gasket strap stops too Fender makes good cheap ones Guitar will never fall off a strap Priced to Sell,positive
Got this for an SGstyle guitar and it fits with plenty of room This is a better quality bag than an 34average34 bag but with a couple of comments1 It smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening2 The large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip Surprised me because its a largetoothed zipper3 Construction seems to be pretty good This is not a hard case but to get a guitar from point A to B it works just fine4 Padding is sufficiently thick Its not a paper thin bag but its not thick enough that the guitar would survive a dropWould I get another one Probably as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances Otherwise Id get a soft sided hard case the new wave of Styrofoam cases or a regular old hard sided case Better than Adequate,positive
I was new to pedal effects new to pedal boards and new to the challenge of how to power it all I did my research and settled on Pedal Train for the board the Mini with case and the One Spot for power This bundleincluding an 8pedal chain a few adapters and the power supplydoes it all In fact it may be overkill I only have 5 pedals so I have to hidesecure the rest of the chain with twist ties And the adapters never used em But it is a complete kit If you need more than this I dont know what to tell ya power your whole board,positive
This winder and cutterwinds and cuts fineBut the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that 34it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins34 Oh wellanother lessson learned Good but not excellent,neutral
I originally purchased the large size and found it to be a bit too big thus I wanted to try the medium Its much smaller than the large but it fits my fingers well Id say I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy The glass is pretty thin so it is not as sturdy as the large but I think it should last a while As long as you dont drop it all the time it should be ok Definitely recommend this slide especially for its price Decent Slide,positive
its ok but a little cheaper quality than I expected I would recommend going a little higher price It also arrived cracked Its ok,neutral
I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer That solution was successful These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12 celestion speaker These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5 Woofer and a 1 Tweeter 40W30W respectively Slight drop in the power output but they are beefy enough that I dont really noticeThe isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless If you really need some get some more substantial pads The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours not really concerned about that but its worth mentioningThey have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout They are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon I would really recommend not going to a retailer even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors Great,positive
Only Lasted 2yr I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more useabuse than this one that have outlasted it Very Disappointed,negative
A must have for anyone to make changing strings on any guitar especially an acoustic Really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot Would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument Nice,positive
Bought it to replace strings for my TaylorDoes all the job that I need it to performWinds the strings fastPulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wireDOES NOT SCRATCH MY GUITARthe only issue really is that it squeaks a lot can be fixed with some oil Pretty neat tool to have,positive
I was skeptical after reading the reviews but the manufacturer must have read the same reviews because these things are solid and the glue that holds the rubber piece seems to be holding up well No issues with the screw not tightening either I plan to buy more of these in the near future It works,positive
Item arrived on time and as described My son loves this polishcleaner He likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny They glisten when he uses this to polish them Great product Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish Cleaner 4 Fluid Ounces,positive
This a great instrument cable If all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one The fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of 34regular34 cables Finally no more knots,positive
My only reluctance about getting this was I thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but I unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does it gets down my guitar tracks in iPad and sounds terrific so the 9900 price tag isnt such a big deal NO learning curve simply connect the included cable from the Jam to your 30pin iPad dock plug in your guitar pull up GarageBand select an amp click on the icon in GarageBand that shows the guitar cable end then select On for monitoring hit record and start jamming man that is ALL there is to it Ive not been one to record on computers for a long time preferring instead to use such things as Fostex 8track recorders Behringer mixers Digitech effect pedals etc but this is going to change all that Awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use UPDATE I mentioned a Behringer mixer above Xenyx 802 I discovered that this Apogee Jam will take the signal routed standard guitar type 14 in cable from the Behringers control out L mono thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs both microphone guitar The sound quality doing this is excellent Ive recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully You just have to be careful not to overdrive the Jam Consequently my opinion of the Apogee Jam is even higher than it was when I wrote my initial review in March I may not even need that Focusrite box now Easy hookup and sounds great,positive
Works just fine great for little spaces between one pedal to another if theres more distance better use another type bue generally works fine and its a good quality product clean signal no problems Works just fine,positive
the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile djs for the price and quality I would buy two other ones ok,positive
This is an original Gibson Gear replacement part Dont change your knobs or any kind of part in your Gibson Les Paul SG or any other if not for the real deal I have a Les Paul and I definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts Besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years Great replacement knobs,positive
I had thin cut strips of duct tape on my fretboard before and then i saw this not only is it alot more visually appealing but its more accurate aswell pretty cool,positive
Ive used this for about 3 months now No malfunctions Looks good Works fine No complaints What more can I say does what its told,positive
But unless you are new to guitar you know that These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer Really I cant tell that they do Or that they dont They sound great and play great and I usually purchase DAddario or Martin strings Not sure if I would pay more for these in future I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way Change the strings every couple of months Just me at home so no big deal if I were performing I would go through them fasterIm giving 5 stars because Daddario makes great strings Nuff said DAddario Makes Good Strings,positive
Works great I have the same effect on my 49 Alesis midi keyboard as I do with my more expensive Yamaha keyboard which has a sustain pedal Chrome is great quality and it has good weight so its not tinny Great pedal and great price,positive
I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into placeI strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there the extra cost is well worth the investment I bought this at my local guitar shop for 40 after looking into it the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was thereUPDATE 11512 A few weeks ago I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers I usually buy locally but the deal here was great The stand is worth the price and more Great stand strong and fully adjustable,positive
It does what its supposed to I really like that the bottom is adjustable and gets the guitar higher or lower off the floor as needed A great price and a good item Good item for the price,positive
These picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well Look cool to I will buy more when the time comes Great,positive
I use it to clean smudges off of my guitars and to keep the fretboards clean after use It works well without scratching the delicate surfacesIt is extremely well made and I have thrown it in the washerdryer and it comes out clean and new looking I keep it in my guitar case and use it often Quality cloth,positive
I got these for a partstele I built and Im really happy with them Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger But they look great work great stay in tune and are completely vintage spec I have a 57 reissue strat and I cant tell the difference One thing Ive always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat Great tuners Great price,positive
This is a very good and stable stand Light strong and very balanced It makes my guitar feel secure It is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag Great Stand,positive
Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a professional musician but I have some experience with guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement equipment I bought this amp for a couple of reasons I wanted a combo that was light in weight easy to movestore and carry and also was clean sounding and slightly loud I can get the sound level I want out of this amp without turning the volume knob up more than 14 but if I ever want more theres plenty of headroom there It is definitely a clean noisefree amp at moderate sound levels and I can add effects through my Line6 Pod Pro if I want to like more drive reverb etc As far as durability goes Ive only had it for a day so I cant say It has a year warranty period Price through Musiciansfriend was good I buy everything for music through them no offense to Amazon Its solidly built All in all a beautifully designed and executed product Thanks ZTUpdate 3112 So far so good Ive played through the amp for a couple weeks now and its great Clean low noise Im used to the controls and love the sound of it No need to even use my Pod Pro Im now thinking of adding an extension speaker cab of my own design using Eminence Designer software and an Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speaker Also considering the Lunchbox extension cab I dont really need more volume but a 12 speaker might change the sound enough to where I like it although I like the sound through the 65 speaker it comes with Always experimenting with my sound To think some people buy 2000 tube amps wow Im not that kind of expertUpdate 31012 I hooked the amp up to a JBL PA cab and it really rocked The JBL 15 woofer in the cab had a lot more bass so I adjusted the ZT tone to give the signal more treble to compensate Hooking up an external speaker is definitely a way to get more volume if so desired Now thinking about an Eminence Deltalite 12 neodymium speaker in a 1 cu ft As an extension speaker Wow,positive
The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago It is difficult to use in a small apartment too loud So after giving up trying to use this with the volume at 1 I searched for a smaller thing This amp looked suspiciously cheap and although the reviews were great still was concerned whether it would be good enough It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features including recording This was really a mind blowing thing The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals and I no longer use my Zoom Setting it emulate a twin reverb with the effects used lightly I am amazed at both the quality of this practise amp and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck This is amazing for the money,positive
I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot I believe its the older metal version of this not the 34Lite34 However this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner on a Martin jumbo acoustic It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords tooIm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one It doesnt seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw I wouldnt recommend it for any guitar without a thick neckMy recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use If you are looking for the screwdown style I would look for the older version of this and avoid the 34Lite34 Will Not Clamp Tightly Enough,negative
all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily so I switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearsHosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable 6 Packand they are still going strong all mine broke,neutral
I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low priceI figured Id get my moneys worth from them regardless They work fine So well that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio The price went up nearly 50 on them though BAH They work great for the studio,positive
Purchased it to use on a 0028 slotted headstock Martin and it just didnt fit well for me Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove A string style worked a lot better was a lot easier to attach and remove and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed Didnt work for me on a slotted headstock Martin,negative
Ive been using only these even since trying them wonderful picks for speed and precision you wont go back for sure My favorite,positive
Im a guitarist with a passion for blues so it was only a matter of time before I was going to pick up the harmonica I almost went with some of the cheaper options but I am extremely pleased with my decision It sounds gorgeous very full and clear and Ive already been able to start bending some noteswhich I understand I notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicasAs a blues guitarist I was tempted to buy a harmonica in D or A that when played in secondposition would allow me to play along with blues songs in A or E two of the most common blues keys especially among the songs I like to play The secondposition for the harp in C is G not terribly common However I think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in C since many of the beginner songs are in C and the C major scale should be very familiar to most musicians In other words as Im exploring the notes they make a lot of sense to me At this price I wont mind buying a D or A when the time comesits not like Im already at a level where Im dying to play those songs anyway And if I need to there are a couple of songs Ive found in G eg Work Song by Butterfield That song along should keep my practicing for a long time If you are still reading this review then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp add it to your cart Fantastic Harp,positive
Great strap for the price Absolutely no complaintsissues at all Light weight but sturdy I was able to put strap locks on this strap with no issues and it works great Comfortable as well Great bargain and quality for the price,positive
Bought these because I thought theyd be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when I want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce They give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string and they dont wear down the strings and I actually use them on occasion for my 34 steel string acoustic guitar when I want a nice mellow tone The only negative is that because of being rubber they 34stick34 to the strings so they arent great for quick strumming which I wish they were Interesting,positive
First we have to realize this is not a 200 pickup or even a 50 pickup Its less than ten bucksIt has a speciallydesigned clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerablesize sound hole It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noiseIt is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 14 to 14 coupler to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitarIt is a passive pickup so you will need either an amp with a passivespecific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device If you dont have a preamp system this will do you no goodSo because of the limitations I rate it as above For what it does though providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments it does okay I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money including adhesivedisk mikes I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many lowcost pickups out there to choose from But this is a slightly different concept removable that for the price is worth checking in to Okay pickup for the price,negative
There are other guitar straps that are nearly the same quality for half the price The thing about this one is that it has a pocket to hold a few picks which is quite useful I also like the leather ends because they dont shift and move around quite as much as my old plasticey one did Overall i think these are abit much for seven dollars but im happy with the purchase Rather expensive,neutral
This is the Godzilla of volume pedals It is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as I run signal through it It appears to be indestructible I like that it has a 34tuner output34 and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver When a friend offered to sell his for 30 bucks I bought it without hesitation I now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my Ditto looper so I can fade it out Volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results If you need 34light34 maybe keep looking If you dont mind the heft you will be pleased A solid well built pedal,positive
So I originally got the virtually identical Mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work Behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most I use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack So much more efficient than a floor monitor I have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips and because there is more than one channel I can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel Very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics Definitely recommend Hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space Behringer vs Makie,positive
I was using a Joyo Power supply and when I bought my Fuzz I ran out of plugs so I bought this It does the job I plan on getting a couple of the Juniors next since I only have 1 18V pedal and the rest are 9s Works great,positive
Second one I bought Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months Went through two of these before I learned my lesson Dont waste your money on this junk I love Planet Waves stuff normally but these are junk Cheap piece of crap,negative
This is an inexpensive but for the money well built case I dont have any complaints My Fender Strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isnt the most durable case I wouldnt use it to ship my guitar it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next Great product for the price,positive
Its a capo nice fit yet sometimes I wonder if it fits too tightly as when I use it and of course the strings are tighter sometimes I feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tightyet it is a capo structured very well NICE,positive
It was Not what I wanted When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 3000 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings It might be good for playing with a Bow I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow Cost Too Much,negative
Definitely the best looper Ive come across Lots of looping time simple to use unlimited overdubsReally cant go wrong with the Ditto Perfect I think,positive
Just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned the thumbpicks both came in medium which at the time I didnt pay any attention to However after about 3 weeks of using them and the fingerpicks on my banjo I came to the conclusion that I needed a large size for my thumb the mediums sat a little too high up my thumbnail for comfort I suppose you could put them in hot water to stretch them out as I have read but regardless for a quickndirty set for someone just starting out its just the ticket without having to buy a bunch of sets of 12 to figure out what is comfortable With priceassortment in mind I give 5 stars Great starter pack for a great price,positive
This is a pretty hot pedal Honestly I have compared this against a Suhr Riot Distortion and an MXR Classic Distortion and quality wise it is REALLY REALLY hard to not hear the difference in terms of quality tone distortion overdrive Great price and well made Joyonice job here Bang for your buck,positive
Ive been playing guitar for about 7 years now and Ive always used the Kaiser capo but since I got this planet waves one the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case Although theyre both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort while I can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar Less pressure is involved and I kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo that isnt actually barring down the frets is under the guitar instead of over it The product conceals itself well to those who arent playing the instrument and it has great use Id recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there Very easy to use,positive
Just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes it was worth giving this box a try As someone else previously mentioned set in a tube breakup setting this device still is a little fuzzy The tone none the less is very usable and sounds great Im a happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well Thanks for reading this Joyo JF02 Ultimate Overdrive Pedal,positive
I am upgrading my Chinese Fender Strat with American Hardware I own an American Strat too and plan on making the best of the Chinese one Going to upgrade electronics and everything else tooThese are exactly whats on my American Strat5 stars very nice,positive
Daddario is a company Ive been using since I first started playing guitar and these strings live up to their title They DO have a warm bright and balanced tone and they last 36 months for me even after playing hours a day For people who finger style on the acoustic it is very comfortable on your fingertips These strings can produce very good sound with little effort I almost always use lightlight medium picks with these strings and it can get to the volume I want Warm balanced longlasting,positive
I got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc They work well for that The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head After a time the pinch is bit much I have a small 714 hat size too However the price was great and the sound is good Im no audiophile but do play guitar mando and dulcimer and for me these phones deliver a good well rounded soundOne other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor useSo if you can deal with the pinch I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality Work well but pinch,positive
It is a guitar stand does what it is built to do good buy for the cost I would purchase again PRETTY GOOD,positive
Ive used these strings on all my acoustics and even gave some to a band mate They seem to keep their tone for a long time and dont change the instrument tone like some strings Ive tried Like a lot of folks Im not that picky about my strings but for those who are this is a good light string that will sound great on your acoustic Strings live up to Martin reputation,positive
Works just fine Except the little knob thats supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings the little pins or whatever it doesnt grip onto mine I have an acoustic jasmine takkamine so I had to get out pliers from my toolbox but thats okay One size doesnt always fit all Good price Good,positive
I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of 60125 but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about 12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesnt provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone not properly disclosed by the company The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cableI was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc over a simple USB headset without 34breaking the bank34 In addition to the positive reviews on Amazon about most of the Behringer equipment my son who has some experience with sound equipment said that Behringer makes solid items but that I shouldnt expect much in the way of customer service Hes helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expectedIm glad that I moved up to this board even though it has a lot of features that I wont personally use Im glad that this has two microphone inputs if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board Besides the extra mic input my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBandI have found that my sons warning is somewhat correct at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website Since this is essentially entry level equipment people like myself who have little no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects particularly in hooking things up to a computer which is obviously an increasing applicationI couldnt find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user for instance In addition it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring etc when using with a computer but they dont Ive done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and runSo far Im getting quality recording results from this board I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMacs linein I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire but I havent had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the futureI believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality I would give 5 stars but the manufacturer should provide more information Solid equipment good value,positive
This is for theKyser BanjoMandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele It works and is my second favorite I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele and it is easy to add move remove With the triggertype release it makes it one of the easiest quickchange capos Ive used It feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo Black My favorite is still the G7th capo This is a close second to the G7thMy only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime UPDATE I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime Free shipping for Prime membersFor the price and quality this Kyser capo works on a uke Highly recommended A very good ukulele capo,positive
It is taking a chance on ordering a guitar onlineI took the chance and got what most of the reviews already sharedHeres my takePROS Cheap 90 is very inexpensive for a guitar Well packaged for shipping Arrived 1 day early Fair quality This is not a top of the line or even middle of the line guitar It is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship but not stellar Good sound This does have a very good sound with new strings of course Size This is not a full size guitar but larger than a 34 It is a concert size which I like It is a cutaway design without electronics This combo is very rare Fair to good wood materials and furniture Good design This guitar sounds good feels good looks very good Matte finish this comes with a matte finish not shiny I like thatCONS Strings corroded poor quality strings neck condition Neck has slight bend I needed to adjust the truss and file a few frets There is still a slight dip and bump at the 12th fret causing fret buzz frets are not smoothed on ends neck surface is not sanded well but smooth enoughI like this guitar Its very inexpensive needs a little work sounds very good I hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase Cheap Guitar fair to decent quality,neutral
I replaced the nasty crooked chipping plastic pins for these and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be Im not convinced that they change the sound of my D28 very much for better or worse I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really couldnt tell much of a difference still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones so I consider them an upgrade Improvement over plastic pins for function,positive
Totally awesome strings Ive heard other strings are great too but I highly recommend everyone try these if you havent Outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding I get these strings every time Elixirs for life Id pay double for these strings all day Get em,positive
Theres not much to say about this product except that it works It makes my strings last longer Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars and 20 minutes per 34well done34 restring adds up This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible Its small and conveniently stored too I recommend trying it out Works,positive
It works well I mean it doesnt crumble apart or anything I use a Fender so its not as much of a worry but I have had one and seen other Les Pauls fall over sideways or get bumped into they then fall and break the headstock Thats why I dont use them anymore Its good,positive
the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe Good product,positive
I needed something so I would not have to drill a hole in my guitar to attach my strapThis is nicer than using a shoelace to attach the strap and it is an EASY QUICK release and is very secure I am happy with this product and will order some more in the future Nice inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem Inexpensive and great How could you not like this simple device,positive
I bought this gig bag to carry my Fender strat around Im just starting to learn guitar so I didnt really know much about my options I figured I had a Fender guitar so I might as well get a Fender gig bagLittle did I realize how good this one really is Most gig bags dont come with all these storage pockets Theres plenty of room for a few books an electronic tuner string winder strings whateverPadding could always be more but thats the case with probably any softshell bag you buyAllinall I like this bag more and more since Ive discovered that all the other options in the price range arent nearly as good Just what I was looking for,positive
For the money this strap is as good as any other poly strap Plus it was made in the USA Great Guitar Strap for the Money,positive
What can I say They look great and were cheap My kind of product Bought them to replace the old 34vintage34 style knobs on my LP clone Much nicer looking New knobs make a difference,positive
I love the performances and sound production quality of Celebration Day The bands on fire and Jason Bonham did a incredible job A must buy for the Zep fan I can highly recommend thisTo rehearse that long for this one show its a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts With Jason doing so well it was possible I could easily imagine NY SF Rio Paris Rom Tokyo etc Fantastic performance Super production,positive
Ive used this live since I got it and it works great no problems Its made of plastic but that doesnt effect anything its pretty tough It has two modes noise reduction which clips the noise and silences it when the note fades out and mute which lets you mute with the stomp switch I use the mute mode live to silence my bass in between sets but I have also used the reduction mode when my pickups were noisy Both modes work great and there is a sensitivity knob to dial in the right clipping Full on it will clip the notes hard and sometimes register quieter notes as noise and clip them all together less and its more subtle Great value and a great tool Great tool,positive
First I would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under 50 Second as a professional piano player I have never found a use for a traveling bench or stool Think about it youve got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand electric light and music perhaps even a storage case for the cables adapters extra fuses batteries tuners sometimes an extra keyboard or two or a couple of tone generators with MIDI cables or if you still pack a Rhodes spare tines and a pair of wire cuttersand youre going to add a bench to your weekly moving equipment caravanIn 90 of the locations that Ive worked Im able to locate a plain chair without arms usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found Not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players especially are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving halfremembered melodies to register the physicalneurological effects until after the job Ive always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playingfar better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy not to mention prostate In fact if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded rising and lowering black Steinway cushions try to replace it with a plain chair without arms Especially if youre doing 4hour gigs sometimes two in the same day youll notice the difference short and long termBottom line your back needs more pampering than your bottom which is why you need a seat with a back Only concert artists like Horowitz and Rubenstein could get away with those cushy Steinway stools30 minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement Some of us arent that luckyor giftedor smart Another great Amazon deal but heres where gear collectors and musicians part company,positive
I buy many of these cable and they all test correctly with a meter and they all work great So far I havent had any issues at all They feel well made and I will continue to use them for the bands PA Dependable cables,positive
Certainly worth every penny you pay for them and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer But if you have a 2000 plus guitar the last thing you want to do is drop it because of bad strap knobspins These are great for sure Amazing quality and reliability,positive
Ive used several different kinds of guitar cables and Ive finally settled on planet waves cables From patch cables to guitar cables I simply trust this company In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android there really isnt one it simply comes down to user prefrence So in that regard I prefer planet waves cables I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar Highly recommended Perfect,positive
I use these cables in my home hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors They appear to be very well built and sound just fine I have had them for several months and they are working perfectly Highly recommended for the price Great for the price,positive
My eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin It seems to be accurate and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself Easy to use,positive
These are nice I like the 114 rigidity and these are just fine for me you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am Once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different Much more grainy and tiny but that may be a plus for you I also like the side edges for a real mellow and or speeding picking style They stay in your fingers well its a Pick,positive
There isnt much to get excited about in a guitar stand however it does its job and the price was right I purchased four and they were all delivered on time Each adjusted to and held its guitar securely I have found the stand to be very stable The welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job My music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much Its does not appear to be of better quality Overlooked deal,positive
I have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a 20 cable These are not cheap but they are priced much better than others And they Work Great No loss of Tone through these cables If anything I had to do some EQ adjusting because after using these I had a far greater signal volume and frequency response when I replaced my other patch cables with theseI Love Them Patch Cables that Work,positive
Okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic A great addition and will serve me well Keyboard,positive
Base is heavy and sturdy so your mics wont topple over But an arm on it and that could be a different story The action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about While I appreciate the weight of the base I do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle Simple Desk Stand,neutral
I was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solidstate amps so I ordered a VHT Special Six supposed to be THE best small tube amp for blues harp I also ordered a Peavey KB2 solid state keyboard amp Then I ordered this pedal and three others graphic equalizer MXR carbon copy delay TREX reverb I figured that I would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo Well everything is being returned except this pedal I found that when I plug this pedal into my old 8 watt Peavey Rage I get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals More tubelike sound than a toprated tube amp ANDif I want a cleaner tone I can dial it back or bypass it altogether My only complaint is that it does not accept a battery You must use a 9V transformer which is not included Oh well my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway Yes it is made of plastic but if you are reasonably careful that should not be a problem UPDATE I just found that by plugging into BOTH the high and low jacks at the same time on the VHT amp it now produces the sound I will keep the VHT and use it instead of my Peavey Rage with this pedal The sound from either setup is pretty close but the VHT requires less fooling around with adjustments and is more resistant to feedback I still might keep this pedal though cause its easily the next best thing to the VHT Special 6 tube amp Harmonica playersPaired with my Solidstate sounds almost like a VHT,positive
I like these picks They look great and work well I have no issues at all with them and they play a little stiff when new but within minutes feel like an old friend Great buy for 3 Give one to a guitar playing friend and watch eyes open wide with a NO WAYYY look on their face Very nice and cool looking work great,positive
The hanger was very easy to install holds my acoustics safelythe instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hangerThe product arrived within 23 days I couldnt believe how fast it got hereAnd yet the price is the best part of all Liked it so much I ordered another,positive
I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time good though they were Too expensive foronly one effect at a time Returned it Great sound well made too limited,negative
I bought this when I was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be micd It really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin I will be buying more of these Very handy,positive
i like the fact they are colored the helps a set up and break downi am going to buy some more good little cords,positive
I ordered this after I saw one on a squier bass at a local shop The plate looks great on my MIM fender Telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the Fender F plate I see on other guitars I used the screws and it was an easy install Other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate The plate has five screw holes but doesnt look bad using 4This is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my MIM Telecaster Thicker than the F plate and nicer than the MIM stock plate,positive
Fine strings that I have been using for a VERY long time of my electric guitars You can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings Bends,positive
I love this tape for multiple reasons one because when its on its on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around you can take it off It wont be easy but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off I was able to get everything off my older board and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it So this is some good stuff Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals as it hooks to itself so youll go through it pretty quickly Grips well great more permanent alternative to velcro,positive
Its a very cute little capo It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course its hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small But it works Great,positive
Love this strap Its a good quality strap and I have three of them Being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild Just go browse a crafts store and see what you can find to make it YOURS I cant let on what Ive done to mine becausethey are originalsbut you can have a blast making a one of a kind of your own Come on were artists so show off your creativity Great To Customize,positive
I bought 2 of these as controllers for my Alesis drum machine One startsstops the drum pattern and the other triggers the fill and change pattern from A to B These things stay put and work every time Solid,positive
I use this pick for first time and it feels great and MAX GRIP for sure Now I do not have to worry loosing pick and my mind while Im leading and playing in worship It feels little bit stiffer than regular 66mm nylon pick I used to use this one and I love feeling and sound when I play guitar Max mAx maX,positive
This amp did a good job for its rating It was my backup amp for a QSC GX5 I sold it after using it for about a year or so It still worked fine when I sold it,neutral
This is a great product just not for me I found it brightened my tone way too much and I went back to plastic Gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and I lost bottom end Might not be right for you,neutral
Just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal I practice more now in the past 2 months than I have in the past two years I highly recommend it if you are looking to spruce up your song writing skills and most of all your soloing skills We got a good deal too Amazon rocks Great pedal great for practice,positive
I like this pedal Its rugged and has a great range of tonal capabilities and rips for hardcore metal That being said the blue LED while cool looking is actually blinding and I found myself placing a finger over it to just see the friggin knobs for adjustments I guess that is a pretty weak complaint but IMO its an impediment more than an enhancement Also the Gate and Scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me which is not expected at this price point A moot point because I am not using the Gate at least as IMO it was 34weird34 in its Gating execution sounded kind of like a very rough algorithm is being used instead of a nice smooth curve But all in all this thing tears it up in terms of pure shredding tone Lots of Customization,neutral
Very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime Easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight Cannot go wrong with this one Great,positive
Im using this unit to set up a Linux Digital Audio Workstation It works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer You will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device Without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records 96kHz but skips when duplexed I mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabledThe following settings are the best Ive been able to manage in jackd2 without and xruns on a realtime kernelusing qjackctl Im also no expertFrames Period 128Sample Rate 96000Periods Buffer 3Which gives a predicted latency of 4msWith a 10ft 14 inch patch cord to run jack_iodelay I got a consistent 824 ms overall latency not bad imhoWithout the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings my computer is a sandy bridge pentium 22ghz with 6gb ram and a ssdWe have used this with an AT2020 AT2021 SM58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high The preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions Simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding Ive also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds rain crickets and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the houseUpdateIve found the above setting in jack dont work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack Here are the best setting I could come up withFramesPeriod 512Sample Rate 48000PeiodsBuffer 3RealtimeSoft ModeQjackctl lists the latency of 32ms but I have not tried measuring i with jack_iodelay All the included effects of rakarrack work on my computer for these while booted in the hard realtime kernel Clean crisp audio Linux supported,positive
I bought a Rogue mandolin from a friend who bought from Amazon but did not have time to even play it for only 25 still brand new never playedI have owned and played many other mandolins about a dozen this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills The mandolin is NOT playable in its brand new state not in tune action too high lower action will result in string buzzes And this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup I went thru all the necessary steps almost like a luthier would do and it came out sweet It now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation One can find info about mandolin setup on the Web Its quite tedious workThis will be my beater mandolin at 25 nothing can beat itIt stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to retune So this is more than adequate for daily practice Often times it even stay in tune the next days I may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one The finish on this model has some blemish some small black spots on top the sunburst color but only if you look really close I would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred at less than 40 no problem at allOf course this mandolin is no match for more expensive modelsbrands such as Kentucky but I gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance cost ratioIf you dont know how to setup mandolin then be prepared to pay 60 to 80 for a professional setup which is a must otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune Some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge thats unfair All brand new mandolins require setup at this expense unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for itIf you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this good mandolin for very little money,positive
Works for practice its a guitar instrument cable what can I say maybe not the best but it serves its purpose maybe not the best but it serves its purpose,neutral
I needed a new microphone cable due to my son destroying the last one so this decided to invest more in a higher quality cable This GLS Mic cable is working well The build quality appears good and should be much harder for my son to break good quality replacement cable,positive
Its rubber and you can slip it under the strings and into the sound holewith a little effort It might even be over 34engineered34 it fits so well Found,positive
Great price but unfortunately this product didnt work for me Fortunately I had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall Im happy with the results Didnt Work for Me,negative
This is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand It holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce However The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger as well as the tailend of the grip because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone you wont be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first Hold mic well in place,positive
Dont Fret Position Indicator for 44 Violin or 1434 Viola is very helpful tool especially for beginners If you start to learn violin buy it it will make your study much prettier Dont Fret Position Indicator for 44 Violin or 14 Viola,positive
Ive Been Using This Item For about 3 weeks now and I love it I Have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board I power 7 pedals and Absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up If anything it sounds better than a battery FOR SURE Great Gear,positive
This mic is excellent its pretty much a straight up clone of an sm57 and for the money there are no mics even close to this one Also the price at orange county speakers website is 29 and 25 in store so Im not entirely sure why its 50 on Amazon Gls ES 57,positive
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough micgreat for all your needsI highly recommend them Shure,positive
As stated I use the DAddario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LPs and I use Brite wires on thoseI like the DAddarios over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easierI do not produce a lot of body acid so strings last a very long time with me no matterwho the manufacturer is and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuseThe EXL strings produce great tone and are great for bending Use both 9s and 10s on all but Gibson LPs,positive
Strings are so subjective and perform so differently depending on the instrument I have a hard time reviewing them I have them on an older MIM P bass and am quickly falling in love with them I tried GHS flats on this bass previously about all I can say is meh too rough they feel more like half rounds just not the right tone on this particular instrument Ive got another P bass fretless with Labella Jamersons on it which are still my favorite flats but these are a close second Add to that theyre half the price of the Labellas and weve got an easy winner Theyre silky smooth and probably more versatile than the Labellas as theres plenty of top end for a wide variety of styles and music My tone knob has never been more useful Most excellent,positive
The absolute best guitar stand made Strong and durable I bought one about 4 months ago and just ordered a second Hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands Excellent Quality Stand,positive
Other than being a little cheaply built it works great I like the fold up into a small package idea Room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands I can put this over the shoulder carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip Traveling musician perfect,positive
It says for a Banjo or a Mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box It is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it onoff is really easy Perfect Fit for my Ukulele,positive
This is a very serviceable strap at a great price I own five of them They last well and are as good as many higher priced straps Great deal,positive
Im rating it 4 stars because although it is able to attach to most mic stands it doesnt fit them all very well Opening up for headliners you basically get given most of your stage gear minus your own instrument gear so if youre given a mic stand that has a smaller diameter tube this will not fit as nicely I was playing a couple shows and this thing would slowly slip down the pole thats what she said Usually worked fine Ill still recommend this wedgie Not meant for skinny bean poles,positive
I dont know why more people dont use these theyre amazing Ive used many strings and owned many guitars These arent diamonds or gretsch but theyre fantastic I love them on my strats The last and make playing a breeze I dont have any tone loss between these and 10s If I do its more than made up by the fact that I can play better with lighter strings Lighter than light strings Ive used them for year and love them,positive
no complaints here the quality is great the sounds is excellent and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp use it all the time jazzgryl52,positive
This pickup sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically It does pick up percussive noise which you dont get with under saddle pickups It is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you dont use a sound hole cover Over all Im please because I was able to install myself and it was simple You do need to use an external preamp but even with piezo pickups that is usually the norm The directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions The only change I had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too Very good sound good directions,positive
Its really hard to beat this product for the price I found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar I really appreciate the low wide stance which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself Great Buy,positive
The size of this makes it awesome for carrying around and it all works great I have it custom mapped for multiple softwares I love the product and all the features for the price My only problem is is that the USB plug on the controller becomes lose very quickly after moderate use This is actually a huge problem once the plug stops working your out of a controller I would recommend this controller for home use and to leave the plug in the controller and do touch unless you have to When unplugging it just be careful and itll last a lot longer The price on amazon is awesome Not mad,neutral
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says it distorts You want something to make your guitar sound like junk this will do it Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use Boutique and distortion are an oxymoronThese things are built with heavy metal it should last I kinda hope it doesntjust kidding you want distortion you got distortion It distorts,negative
I thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk Because well these days you usually get even a little less than what you pay for But this tuner destroyed those expectations Its a small smart tuner So many functions and just a great design Its really cool that I dont have to go hunt down a tuner that could be lost in my room somewhere This attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter The only thing negative I have to say is im not so sure you can plug a cable into it Which you would expect with ALL the other stuff it comes with Otherwise its pretty great Best Tuner Ever,positive
Midlevel quality The shoulder strap tends to move while you play Gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist Decent,neutral
This bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price BTW thats all I have to say so dont MAKE me type more Great strap,positive
I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites The sound I get from the ADG strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp The strings seem to hold up well I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle These strings sound great I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing Great sounding on a 3 string Cigar Box guitar,positive
I own two of these and they are perfect for home studio vocals and a step above dynamic mics as long as you run this one through a pre I use aPreSonus Tubepre SingleChannel Vacuum Tube Mic Pre No matter which pre you get make sure it can supply phantom power because this mic needs itAlso this model is XLR only Even if you get an XLR to TRS adapter you will not be able to provide phantom power to it with that arrangement so make sure that your mixer has a spare XLR input for this mic and that it will provide phantom power if you skip my recommendation to get a pre ampThere are a few other things you need to know or consider if this is your first condenser mic use the included shock mount because this mic picks up handling noise Merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix A pop filter is essentialThis mic is not optimal for live performances because its delicate and does not lend itself to excess handling It is perfect in controlled stationary environments like home studios Another reason is itd will pick up a lot of nearby stage noise if not placed in a sweet spotI mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is However it is not the best solution for micing instruments or amps especially those in the lower registers One of the main reasons for this is the low end frequency response is starts at 30Hz You would be better off with a mic that goes down to 20Hz for instruments and ampsBottom line this is a great entry level condenser mic especially for folks on a budget As long as you understand its limitations and operating characteristics you should be pleased with it I have had mine for almost four years and both have held up and and still sound great for vocals Not pro quality but great for home studios on a budget,positive
Perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic This helps my 34Apogee One34 to always be in perfect position and far from accidents and drops Add 34Apogee One Mic Mount34 Perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic,positive
I was shocked when I got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was For the sake of letting you know its compatibility I have used this to effectively tune an acoustic guitar an electric guitar a mandolin and a 4string bass Thats a huge range for any tuner Ive had older versions of clipon tuners and this one just works faster and better Recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges The ones made for guitar have limited range but are cheaper but I would imagine theyre just as accurateIm not a huge fan of the red color it is really bulky and noticeable on all the instruments Ive had but Im happy with the tradeoff I just wish there was a smaller more discrete option or something in black or a more muted color Best headstock tuner for a variety of instruments,positive
Nearly all of the reviews I read on these were very positive and I concur These are very nice solid tuners especially for the priceThey do add a little noticable weight to the headstock but its not a problem FenderPing tuners,positive
With a twang twing twong nothing wrong gotta love these strings that just wanna sing Fender has never hendered,positive
i bought these because i couldnt see spending 450 a dozen at the local music store I figure 12 dozen will last me for years Get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like I can easily do fender gross of picks,positive
i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the timeits small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break stringshands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands It winds and cuts D,positive
Seems great need more time to explore what it can do frist Comment,positive
Works great I use this thing several times per week in rehearsals and it always does the job My only critique would be in battery life maybe a different setup it uses 3 AAA batteries would provide longer life Otherwise its great Mighty Bright Duet Music Stand Light,positive

Works very well although I wish it had wider strapping or a choice of purchasing with a wider strap Dont hesitate to purchase Neotech 8001912 Simple Sling Black,positive
The reason they are called silk and phosphor is that the wound strings have silk along with steel in their cores the wire around which the windings are wound rather than just steel This allows them to tune to pitch with less tension so they can be the ideal string for a beginner or someone who is moving from nylon There are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings The lower tensions and light gauges mean that they may not drive some guitar tops hard enough to let them perform up to their capability That is they may sound soft and cheap I would not put them on most Martin dreadnoughts for example But they may work fine on lightly braced guitars The only way to find out for sure is to experimentThese are an experiment for me I usually use silkandsteel on my guitar banjo it was time to change strings and I stumbled across these Ill have to see where things settle down but so far Im willing to give these silkandphosphor the nod over silkandsteel The sound is a bit brighter My music partner says she prefers the way these silkandphosphor blend with her fiddleThis is so out there that I wont let it influence my rating My guitarbanjos tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass The ends of the windings at the bottoms of the bare steel 1st and 2nd strings stick out a bit so I had trouble putting them on I was able to use a fine wire cutter to nip the end of the 1st string but it didnt work for the 2nd string I ended up using a DAddario string of the same gauge in its place Admittedly it was a tight fit but I was able to put it on without working on it Yes theyre softer Theyre silk,positive
This is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars The cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used While it doesnt fold up small like a portable stand it serves well as a semiportable stand and is very good as a stationary stand good low cost stand,positive
My band had no PA or mics or anything While I admit these are not the quality a band will work up to they fill up the stands at an affordable price Not much distanceyou have to 34eat34 the micsbut the sound is great Full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound This is a great place to begin As needed,positive
My title says it all I didnt like the AC adaptor I did work very well and was strong I liked how solid it was It worked but should be usb powered,neutral
The tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo Ive ever used and Ive tried many over the years But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem including the pick clip and tuner holder protude outward away from the fingerboard Its awkward to apply and remove quickly Its visually distracting for player and audience and it doesnt add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustmentThe only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck but even that doesnt fly Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and unless youre avoiding playing that first fret or use a lowthumb classical fret hand position youre always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand I own the older Planet Waves triaction capo and never felt that to be a problemOtherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb The surface is arched probably between a 1012 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SGLP style It doesnt work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM1 which is virtually the same as a classical If I cranked the tension its possible the rubber would flatten out but I wouldnt risk marring the neck woodI tried both the pick and tuner clips and theyre functional but to be honest I wouldnt use either too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments depending on what they areThe only other capo Ive ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious wrought iron fence design I have one and as good as the holding action is Ive never felt comfortable with the design The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preferenceTo top off the confusion the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way thats impossible with this capo Bizarre Variant of the older Planet Waves TriAction Capo,negative
Super sturdy well built What more can I say its a sheet stand Five Stars,positive
Bought this for a friend Cheap plastic enclosure Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal Not worth the few dollars youll spend on it,negative
Works exceptionally well In fact this works better than regular singlelayered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not noticeWell worth the money The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands Works Like a Charm,positive
I set this to free super saver shipping 58 days and it got here in three Its very shiny looking and easy to see because there is a little thing where you can move to point the screen of it Although my friend told me there is a way you can see the chords you are playing dont know how though But all I bought it for was the purpose of tuning Mission accomplished 5 stars for you Cool look,positive
I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didnt get tripped over or dinged Enter the String swingI have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no troubleThe Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds its own center of gravityThe base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory I didnt use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studsThese are well worth the cost If you own several guitars you probably have no floor space These solve 2 problems at once,positive
What a great Aframe stand especially for the money Its lightweight but superstable I like it so much that I ordered three more All 7 of my electric guitars fit wonderfully onto the stand as do my acoustics The similarlypriced Fender is a FPOS It leans WAYYY too far backI couldnt have hoped for more from these stands Buy one Buy a couple Sturdy great design and inexpensive,positive
The strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition The strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable I would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap Exactly what I was expecting,positive
I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that doesnt have built in reverb Put a battery in and plugged it in Very simple But the sound was horrible No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful On the other hand the reverb from my Korg AX100G that I was using on another rig was great Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly but I dont think so I think thats the way it really sounds So I got a return authorization from Amazon very easy never fails put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refundJM Tepper Sounds awful you get what you pay for,negative
A must have for the Yamaha PA130 You can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries That keeps the weight down tremendously and as long as yo have a plug youa re good to go Saves you a ton of batteries,positive
I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price I might as well give it a try This thing works great There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to otherwise youll get some rattling noise from the strings Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it it works very fast when you need to change keys FAST shipping,positive
I needed a new strap but I didnt want to pay 20 for one I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot Im glad I did The strap is awesome Its very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap Ive ever had It totally deserves 5 stars Great,positive
This is a super easy to use pedal You just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset Dont worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound If you really want to be able to tweak everything then get the MXR Analog chorus instead It has about six knobs I like the ease of use on this one and I omly use chorus sparingly Another cool feature of MXR pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it It allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot review of MXR Micro Chorus,positive
They were a little too much for the Squier Bullet I put them on even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neckWhile I had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness More metal moving over a guitar pickup hotter sound more gain and on a Stratocaster more glass and bell like tonesIve used Ernie Balls Slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades They never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great Lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical soundFun fact Get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery There is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound RINGing out of your amplifier A little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent Thick and chunky just like I like my chili,positive
I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars a Fender American Standard Strat and a Fender American Standard Telecaster One was in the SKB Fender case 9995 on Amazon the other in a Gator case purchased locally I was told it was just as good as the Fender case Both ended up in checked luggage After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back nonstop minimal handling the glue on the top section of the Gator case gave up The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape but with the padding loose the Gator case is going to require some repair before it can be used again Other than a couple of scuff marks on the SKB Fender case its as good as new I just ordered another SKB Fender case The Gator will be reglued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on Travels very well,positive
They work no issues handy to have on hand Dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place inventory product,positive
very durable and flexible if you are looking for something nice and strong get this cables nice,positive
Works well since I got it I didnt change battery for more than 6 months Very good product,positive
Ive been using these strings on all my guitars electric and acoustic since the mid70s Ive tried many others but always come back to Ernie Balls They tune better and they keep the new strings sound longer and thats the main plus but they just feel good I play and practice a lot and I abuse stringsthese can take it and come back for more Best string on the market,positive
I have used these and I noticed this capo is a cut above the rest It snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away I do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off I would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts Great Capo,positive
What makes a good cable One that works Ive had these XLR cables fail because the pins get loose so I hope this doesnt happen to this one Its a cable,positive
Great output Jack i love this one much more because is more durable Works fine with any guitar Try one Fender 1434 Output Jack,positive
Ill re rate this item if my problem is fixed but maybe this is normal I have a Vox ac30hw2x and I put this jj 12ax7 into v1 I have a significant volumegain reduction now I know its the tube because I can put the stock ruby back into v1 and the volumegain is back I havent checked yet but Id say there is a 4050 loss in volume I was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube Its not stamped to be one so thats why Im confused Is it typical of JJ to have more headroom Im not digging this tube so far so back in goes the Ruby Sounds good if I turn up my amp up to 11,neutral
Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute is good tool for your violin If you are afraid to disturb your neighbors when you are practicing violin just buy it It will put the sound down It really works Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute,positive
Very happy with it considering the price point Id buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you dont need a hard case Great for the knock around uke though nice little bag,positive
Schaller guitar strap locks work really really well However I had problems at first until I made some changes First off you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen The blue stuff will be more than enough Second the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turnloosen the screw over time Kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar So When I install the new button I put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first Never had one unscrew againIf you do those things first you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident Ever But you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock I put this on all my Guitars but you need to know something,positive
this stand is small but does the joband folds up in to a small packagei have one for each guitar guitar stand,positive
Not as bright as I would like them however very nice I can practice without lighting up the whole house Im glad that I bought it And then there was light,positive
i bought this cable in an emergency situation one where I was on the road needed a great cable and didnt have access to roll my own using what wouldve been essentially the same parts I exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio and in critical places of my live setup The cable itself is top shelf quiet and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect As an instrument cable this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch making it worth it to go for the 18 cable as a bass or guitar player if you dont like being tied down I used this as part of a keyboard rig where it was perfect on all levels quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum the highs were crystal the bass clear connection is solid I am not a gold fanatic but these are excellent great warranty and a reputation that holds value These are real deal pro cables as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price but not necessarily a superior build or sound which is why I didnt walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster 1000s and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead a top notch cable period,positive
Im going this stompbox as I always do based on the quality of the pedal and what it does not necessarily whether than tone is useful for my particular setup Viewed in that objective light the Joyo JF13 AC Tone is an excellent pedal for 40 to 45There are two ways to think of the JF13 and the other Tech 21 clones in this line California American British Sound etc The first is the obvious one which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain This box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to clone a VOX AC30 amplifier into the speaker How effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self At the end of the day if your amplifier particularly the budget solid state ones has certain limitations that you dont like too bright not loud enough too muddy breaks up too easily no pedal including a 200 boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficienciesBut the second way to think of the JF13 is as a preamp where the output would go directly into a recording device PA system computer or tablet I dont have enough experience trying that though I did a little bit with the Joyo California to say how well that works but Ive heard great examples of it online Also having the convenience of amplike controls with 6 knobs is certainly very convenient if you like to playrecord in that mannerAs for the sound of the pedal its very good Ive heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up but I wouldnt let that concern you Thats true of virtually any distortionoverdrive pedal it can be cleaned up with a noise gatesuppressor and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low and midgain settings anyway The Drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp Its a very nice tone responds well to picking and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume which many pedal distortions do not do The Voice knob is hard to describe Basically it morphs the tone into something deeper and punchier as you turn it up But that also changes the impact of all your other settings including drive EQ and levelIf I had one complaint about this pedal even compared to the California also a very cool pedal I was a little surprised how much this pedal wants to be dirty Its tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily But again I think part of that is youre basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo Check out some of the YouTube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder it could be completely different in that context At any rate its a very intriguing device at only 40 and I could see finding new uses for it in the future I havent envisioned yetUPDATE April 2013 I actually sold this pedal instantly regretted it and then bought it back Now that I understand how to use it properly by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp through the effects loop I am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal It really is an excellent value either as a foundation pedal or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a PASpeaker system I wont be letting the AC Tone go this time VOXtype tones as a preamp or stompbox at an affordable price,positive
This is a good solid cable with no problems When Im on stage I like a longer cable but at practice I dont need all the extra length tangleing up on everything Perfect for practice,positive
This is exactly the item I needed for my podcasting rig It holds my Behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box It lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when I need to use my table for something besides podcastingThe stand is easy to assemble and is very well built Theres nothing bad I can say about it if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up Highly recommended Solid Stand Perfect For Podcasting Rig,positive
ive had this strap for at least a year now and it still works so well goes great with my guitar too Great strap affordable price,positive
Lets face it Im sure there are better compressors than this for about 3 to 4 times the price but this brought my amp into the light Bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction Got the Danelectro wall wart for it Worked great The free shipping was lighting fast and I got more than I bargain for Get one night day,positive
The biggest question I ask about these cables are they worth the premium charged above more normal cables The key to me is the lower end 100 series Monster cablesMonster S100I12 Standard 100 14Inch Instrument Cable 12 Feet The answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking forThe cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew In some ways this is probably good they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging The jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime On the other hand the series 100 plugs are a molded plastic end with a good bit of flex to them and they are lighter weight So the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight grayblack For me I like the heft of these cablesConstructionwise these are likely lifetime cables Check out the pictures Ive posted The metal housing screws into the jack There is an Oring to seal the top portion of the threads Inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic Unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war the wire is never separating from the jack I dont think the actual 14 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacksSound is excellent They are clear clean cables Are they better than the 100s Oh maybe a tiny bit Maybe a little clearer cleaner sound But it isnt a huge differenceBottom line for gigging probably go with the 100s The jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace For practice or in your house these are probably the way to go They do look particularly good plugged into a Marshall half stackThese cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else Monster Cable Study different one quarter inch jack cables and youll see these are priced very close to everyone else This is not the case of the HDMI cables at the big box store for fifty times what you should pay for them Solid and Heavy,positive
I bought the Special 20 Pro PackKeys GA CLove them Was using cheep Pidmont Blues HarpstoysI had to have more like an addictionI bought a D then this Bb then EWont be long Ill get a FThis harpBb has a beautiful toneAlways loved the sound of the BbMade in Germanyquality musical instrumentnot a toyIf you own Special 20s then you already know how good they areIf you dont try oneYou might end up with 6 like meor morein no timeWorth every centIf they are good enough for John Popper Bob Dylan theyre good enough for meA PLEASURE to playJoe A pleasure to play,positive
This is my favorite pedaland I have a ton Lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal Great bluesy tonessweet and warm when the drive is downmean and nasty when the drive is cranked up Like a cranked tube amp If you play the bluesthis is your pedal Im sold Ive purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals Best blues pedal out thereperiod,positive
Ive got a MXR MC404 CAE for my concert line pedals but this one is the one I use for local gigs and home use with Fender Telecaster and Hot Rod Nothing sounds like the classics,positive
I think a set of five is a bit overkill since i only needed three but these are a direct replacement for the originals As expected,positive
They sound great and Id purchase them again With ten packs it will likely be a while before I do so Good strings for a good price,positive
If you are like me and truly value your usually expensive prized instruments then you want to make sure nothing happens to them accidentally or otherwise The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest They have a better base design and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling no worries just make sure you lower it all the way as it is designed to beThese things are awesome Also everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands All of the other tristands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together Not here plenty of room for everything now This stand and the double version which I also own lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture Also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off or if it gets bumped that it could fall out This mechanism holds it tight until you want it and releases it very easily and naturally for you but will not let it go while its just sitting there Check these things out you will not be disappointedAlso as for durability I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years tossing it around my car to play at different places Its been tossed dropped setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it It doesnt even have any obvious visible scratches on it it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it Meanwhile I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc I will only every buy Herc stands from now on Best Guitar stand out there,positive
If you are replacing your old butterfly trees you can use the same holesclip and sand off the alignment pins as they are not really needed and justadd another hole to your headstockGood trees for the price Better than butterflies Clip off the pin,positive
They sound great They helped revive an old acoustic guitar that had been buried in a closet for years along with a very thorough cleaning I dont have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers I honestly didnt notice anything different I bought them because I wanted great strings on an old cheap guitar in order to get the best sound possible These strings did that just fine The guitar now sounds great Job completed Great strings,positive
I love it I used this for my Yamaha ypt230 and it works great I would recommend it to anyone awesome,positive
This unit is very small and tucks away nicely It is easy to use I do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well I would recommend this to anyone Very Nice Very small,positive
i like this very muchbecause i cant love a polypropylene guitar strapif you have a neck and a guitarthen you are in business you really cant ask more than that from a strap it feels fineand if you have a bedazzler you can write your name on itme not so muchill just leave it hang jayjustin,positive
Its a little harder to open than other capos Ive used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it Its not cheap and flimsy though I dont see this one wearing down anytime soon Now stop reading this review and buy this capo You wont regret it Great,positive
but what you ask This tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily Mine broke and so did my friends Its probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to get a replacement clip Works fine but,positive
I put a set of Elixir Nanoweb custom light strings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a couple of months ago Although I dont play gigs on it I play the guitar just about every day or maybe every other day The custom lights are wonderful great durability nice tone and projection easy on the fingers I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 34 size travel guitar I have The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings thereby putting less stress on the body Compared with the light DAddario strings that came with the guitar these have a more muffled low E string The A string too doesnt project as much as the standard strings Although Ive not tried the extra lights on my fullsized acoustic I suspect that there too the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands Even with the custom light setwhere the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light setthe bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality The thing that most players of Elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability They are smoother feeling than noncoated strings and certainly dont degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings The other thing thats important to know though is that the Elixirs are excellent at holding a tune once theyre stretched and broken in That being said Im not sure that I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the bass projection issue a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings dont help As you might have guessed though Im thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the fullsized acoustic Long Lasting Easy on the Fingers,positive
This is great but I needed an actual soundhole cover I bought this along with the Planet Waves Screeching Halt soundhole cover Though only using it for a short time I did notice the bottom end seemed more focused More focused low end,positive
I love Tascam gear and have used it for nearly 30 years I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do Unfortunately I was disappointedWhile the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good the actual function with the computer left much to be desired Also the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions Sorry but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CDThere was a very small quick start guide included which basically just named the various switches inputs and outputs and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multitrack mode I could not I could record and layer multiple tracks I was using Audacity didnt want to install Cubase but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input Now this could have been my computer or Audacity as it is an older Win XP machine but it played back multiple tracks without problemThere was nothing in the miniquickstart guide to address this or even hint where one should look other than going to Tascams web site Im sorry but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive There should be a complete manual at least in pdf included with the product If I am going to use this to do serious recording the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website or worse from user community threads in some blogWhich brings me to another minor complaint no Linux drivers included I use mostly Linux with only one Windows machine for software which I cant get on Linux I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraintsThen there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware With a hardware mixer I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle 3 or 4 on some mixers at the same time Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls The controls on this interface were very fussy and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react I found it very tedious and again no actual instructions were included to help with that process With a touch screen it might be easier but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case Yeah I know touch screens are COOLAlso software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS and that means everyone can have a different experience consistency is much harder to maintainI am old school and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers and saving space etc etc I value function over fashion however and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear it was supremely functional This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusableGood mixers especially for multitrack recording can be complex and difficult to learn The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first and takes some time to get comfortable with Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multitrack recording which was helpful to aspiring recording artists Not so hereI had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars but sadly it only rates a 2 25 if I could for me Come on Tascam you can do better than this A mixed bag,negative
I use this on my Takamine and my Tele It is easy to use applies the right amount of tension and looks very cool You can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it Cheaper ones will work but I wanted to try it out I do like it Nice capo A bit pricey,positive
This is a really strong capo The spring is very robust Well padded and will not damage your instrument I have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin Takes some hand strength to open it but you dont want a weak capo Very Strong Capo,positive
No sign of wear and tear and the holes are really tight minimizing the likelihood of the guitar breaking free occasionally it never once came undone in all these months not sth you can say about all guitar straps Been using it heavily for several months doing just fine,positive
This is a great xlr cable and does the job for what I need it to which is attach my dslr shoe to an external shotgun mic It has low noise clean soundgood transmission The only issue is that this particular cable moreso than any of my other ones is hard to get a locking click on anything it attaches to on either end Once its attached its fine but then its the same coming off I have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried Ill damage a microphone With expensive equipment Id use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me Well donea little too well done,neutral
This is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise Its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out the wire cutters also work really well Im glad i bought this product String winder a little Squeaky,positive
Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus but not quiet up to par Youll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips OK but,negative
It is a Fender product so it is well made Reasonably priced It will make any Strat or Tele build shine Fender Neck Plate,positive
When its about wah effects Im too careful cuz not all brands make it well When I found this one I can be shure that there is no more wah sound out there crunchy warm and with the clarity of this I prefere vox in wah effects and this its a great choice and its too cheap for the quality you get 100 happy with this Recommended the perfect wah sound,positive
These are durable but I get some noise from the cables Its barely audible but its distracting nonetheless Three Stars,neutral
This is probably the best pedal purchase I have ever made Im not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better but this one sounds exactly how I would expect a compressor to work It just makes things sound solid Ive watched the wave envelope it puts out using Audacity and Adobe Audition and the compression works as advertised For a cheap compressor its hard to beat,positive
Ive tried different kinds of headphones in the past and so far the Bose AE2 fits my taste Ive been using it for years when my son borrowed it a month ago and Im pretty sure he has no intention of giving it back Its the 5th headphone he borrowed so I planned to buy another one but I said to myself why not try something different After reading all the reviews on this product I finally decided to go for it And WOWi was blown away Im glad I tried something else No regrets This one really fits my taste The clarity is superb and the bass is awesome Simply The Best,positive
I ordered two PDMIC58s and they came with an XLR to 14 cable included However the quality of these cables are mediocre at best I recommend purchasing a higher quality cable with your orderNow to the performance This mic is built like a tank yes as others have said It is somewhat heavy but not too heavy in other words it doesnt feel like a cheapAs for the sound quality I would have to say 3 out of 5 because the mic doesnt sound as clear as I would like it to be Now Im not a professional but this is just my opinion Im not saying it sounds muddy but it sounds tinny youll have to see for yourselfOther reviews have also said that this is a great backup mic or karaoke mic I agree However if you are looking to record professional sounding tracks you wont find it at this priceValue To me I think its definitely a mic worth having even if its just laying around at this price you cant beat it Its a great mic for the priceUpdateAfter using this microphone for a while I find it to be somewhat lacking Dont get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should However if you are looking to make quality recordings I would pass on this purchase PDMIC58 The Bang for The Buck Update,neutral
I scored a virtually unused preowned unit for 50 It is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features but simple plug and play operation is possible My original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my PC My only gripe and it is considerable is that the unit sounds too digital to me particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade I probably would have loved this thing when I started playing more years ago than I care to admit I prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals Does that make me a gear snob Not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days Ive also owned a Tech 21 Trademark 60 analog modeling amp not bad but traded and still have a Tech 21 TRI AC analog preampgreat pedal and a keeper both are modelers and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers I just prefer analog all the way around I eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar He likes it fine I gave 3 stars because its a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors I wanted to like this product,neutral
i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy it would be nice to have a counter weight for the long reaches but can work around that detail its well made great boom,positive
Really they are I really dont have anything more to say about it Ive played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever Affordable accurate and they dont fall off your knee all the time lol Best Tuners Ever,positive
Theres a reason why so many uke manufacturers supply these strings as standard on their best ukesthey are simply the best there is for a fair price The sound brightens up and amplifies even the most dull sounding uke and allows for a smooth experience once stretched properly Not much more can be said about these awesome stringsstop reading this and order them The best Period,positive
This stand after I finally figured out how to attach it so that it didnt interfere with the boom on my mic stand works okay Due to its heaviness it does hold a good size amount of music however it is short widthwise so you cant really get an open notebook to stay in place at least not with the mic boom there Heavy to travel with also so I dont know how much Ill use it its heavy,neutral
To start off with the unit is all metal construction and built like a tank it is very easy to set up and use the controls are selfexplanatoryYou can get a wide variety of coarse effects from this unit from the very subtle to the crazy overdriven David Gilmour soundOne distinct feature this pedal has that sets it apart from the rest is you can actually use base and trouble cut off controls to tailor the sound to make it sound less tinny and more fullOverall for the money this is a fantastic value wellbuilt and has outstanding sound get it you wont be disappointed I love this chorus pedal,positive
Seriously just stopDont be like me and wonder what all the fuss is for years just go ahead and get a pair They are just awesome When I finally got mine I opted for the anniversary edition as they were on sale and I am seeing the regular athm50s right now for 119 Thats crazy cheapI had some rather inexpensive Sony headphones for about eight yearsstill have them actually that are comfy and sound good but not entirely accurate The ATHM50S are really solid studio headphones I cant imagine why I have taken soooooo long to try them for myself They exude quality and are comfy even when Im wearing my glasss which many headphones are not Not for long seasons anywayI use the ATHM50S in my home studio and I have started taking them along in my gear bag for studio sessions along with a 15 headphone ext cableI feel oSo foolish having lived without these cans for so long dont you do the same Stop Looking and Buy Them Already,positive
I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wahwah pedal it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable I suspected that the potentiameter was shot so I had that replaced but the same problems reoccurred Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using itGood product but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had Durability Issues with Potentiameter,neutral
I prefer the light strings but you have to allow them to stretch a little or you might break on when changing The lighter the less tension you should use I love the price and they last me quite a while Arrived quick and on time,positive
This guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well I am now a fan of Takamine Their is nothing bad I can say about this guitar and I would take this guitar anywhere This is my 4th guitar I have bought and is by far my favorite guitar I have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic this being the second acoustic I wanted a cheap guitar I could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up except I got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up People are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish It wasnt supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look If this guitar was glossy it wouldnt be as nice sounds stupid but it is true You have to see the guitar face to face to understand what I mean This guitar I would recommend to anyone I am trying to get my friends to buy one so can all have a acoustic guitar lol Thank You Very Nice Guitar,positive
This is a great effect Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products has always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable This is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations Ships fast Highly recommended MXR Micro Amp Effects Pedal Great effect,positive
The only solid white leather strap I could find that didnt have any ornamentation It is of average quality but for the price I wasnt expecting much It looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black Ibanez RG550XX Nice color decent quality for the price,positive
These cables have taken a beating the last few months and have served me well with no problemsReal metal ends not molded on with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors High quality low cost,positive
These are excellent guitar picks They dont slip in my fingers like the Eddie Van Halen guitar picks I purchased a while back Excellent Guitar Picks,positive
Handy dandy little gadget So much better than using pliers to remove bridge pins nail clippers to cut strings and much easier to wind strings with this thing Ive got 10 guitars and 3 basses so i change a lot of strings and this definitely makes it less of a chore Love Planet Waves stuff How have I lived without this,positive
It claims to stop 34string talk34 when you rub fingers on wound strings It doesnt But it does reduce it somewhat and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long or playing a new song over and overI gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips Seems to help my callouses without messing them up and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing Doesnt Quiet Squeak but Helps,positive
Good basic first amp Great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house Compact size makes storage easy good amp,positive
I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics They had mimimal oilstain from the factory Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks I use it every other time I restring my guitars It is a really good product I use it on all of my guitars except my Strat that has a maple neck Love itit works,positive
Behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals I have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer It is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting Ive had more expensive pedals over the last 25 years of playing but its hard to beat the price features and quality of the Behringer pedals More for less,positive
I bought this to use with a Spider IV 75 Amp so far it works perfect Provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volumewah pedal that works great You can plug it into the PC and customize everythingRecommended Great product,positive
I have tried some others and was not to happy since they really did not tune the strings correctly the sound was off slightly This seems to be good for a 34quick tune34 but like the pelal with cord plug in better The pedal types are much bigger and you will have to carry more stuff out when going to a gig This does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment Work Good for tuning my bass,positive
This may have been the best money Ive ever spent for a guitar accessory I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck It has a smooth action no kerchunk noise My guitar stays in tune when capoed I love it LOVE IT,positive
I really like the delays and the reverbs on this pedal i recomend this model it will work if you need a lot of effects in one box it really sounds great the distortions sounds great too Line 6 M5 StompBox Modeler,positive
I have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables These are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong These are currently the only cables I use on my pedalboard Short of monster or mogami these are the best you can get for the money Best for the money,positive
In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same categoryBefore I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58 Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966 the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructibleThe mic capsule is of cardiord heart shaped design which helps reject sound from either side There is a 4K bump in its frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise Construction is rugged frequency response is 50 to 15000 Hz and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noiseWe used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldnt find one just grab one of these they are that tough Ive seen some of these on the road that you couldnt believe still worked but they did and sounded greatThe cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only its distinctive look one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced but its part of the functionality Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element As a frame of reference theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule but without the pop screenShure also sells a Performer series mic theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buyThe Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price they really are a good deal Takes A Licking And Keeps On Ticking,positive
Works perfectly for me it does got a nice madePlus nothing could beat its price so get it Quality Great Price Wonderful,positive
I really love this little tuner I just keep it on the headstock of my guitar when playing just touch up tuning if needed Best tunerI have owned for the priceR Joyner Snark Instrument Tuner,positive
Not much to say about a plain leather strap except that its what I wanted and serves me well with the Fender guitar its strapped to Just what I wantedlogowearat a good price,positive
First of all dont be oversold by the extraordinary value that some reviewers claim this fiftybuck inputting device to be Akai is considered a budgetpriced version of and a step down from Sony which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself But its the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with Garageband BandintheBox Finale Sibelius Audacity or a similar program The last thing I would do is lug a 50pound PC or SP Kurzweil model plus AC power transformer upstairs to place on an overcrowded desk Even the 12pound Yamaha NP30 with its 76 notes is awkward to use for this purpose Make it nothing longer than a 41note keyboard but if you can get one at half the price of the EMusic 41note that may be the handiest most practical device for your needsSure there are alternatives You can click at a virtual keyboard that Garageband makes available for a mousebut its slow Or you can download a virtual keyboard to your iPad or iPod for a couple of bucks but its limited to no more than an octave and a touch screen which though superior to mouseclicking still isnt as satisfying or immediate as inputting by pressing down on actual physical keysThis cheaplymadeeven cheapbut effective Akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely especially for someone whos working in congested space Its regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard Its nothing of the sort nor should it be Thats the reason I initially went with the NP30 only to find that the bipurpose instrument I had in mind was impractical for either intended useTake a look at the Korg Nano piano and if youre a pianist youll immediately see the superiority of the Akai But be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the Akai or the EMusic or youll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name Performance This Akai model looks and feels like a kindergartners tendollar toy but its the best compromise Ive been able to turn up for my crowded work area When tiny and cheap is better than big and expensive,positive
you will want this to save your batterys when there is no power around not much more to say good luck box power adaptor,neutral
These foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do and they do it just about average as you expect My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and misshaped upon delivery If your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it They Reduce Pop Boom and Wind Noise,positive
I bought this to replace my Blue Snowball because Ive reached that point where I require something that sounds a little bit more professional than what I was using Before I begin my review Id like to mention that I use this with a Behringer 302USB Premium 5Input Mixer with XENYX Preamp copy and paste that into Amazons search to find it So my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thingOkay my pros and consPros1 My voice sounds great with this thing Before I was using a Snowball and my podcast partner told me it sounded like I was in a 34chamber34 With this my voice is strong and clearand even a little bassy which is nice because I dont have a naturally bassy voice Im extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound It is WORLDS better than USB mics like the Blue Snowball Worlds better2 Its heft heavy and feels well made This might be the most expensivefeeling device I own Its heavy but it in a good way The materials feel high quality This feels like a professional microphone3 It comes with a mic stand holder thing Never say no to free stuffCons1 The only thing I can think of is that it doesnt come with its own cable Youll need to buy an XLR cable on your own Its not bad enough to deduct a starThere are people who are comparing this to the Shure SM57 and other microphones Heres the thing I am an amateur Before I owned this mic I was using a Blue Snowball and before that my laptop webcam mic So I am not the authority All I can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing My podcast cohost immediately noticed the difference and couldnt tell me enough of how much better I sounded and thats over a Skype call we podcast using Skype So if youre looking for a vocalpodcast mic this is a great cheap option Are there better options Sure but not for this price Not even close Recommended wholeheartedly Great for voice overs and podcasts,positive
I bought the Vox Amplug AC30 and loved it so much it probably doubled or tripled the amount of time I play guitar I loved it so much I went out and got the more expensive by 10 Joe Satriani Signature Amplug I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30 and delay feature is a lot of fun But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug Why did have only a 4star review on Amazon among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products Would it be only a one trick ponyWell I have to tell you I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is and Im now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews Ive tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier and many pedal users are seeking what they call a Marshallinabox In other words they want a effects pedal that will singlehandedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls Believe it or not the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a Marshall sound as I can imagine And it comes in a small plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of 3999Functionally the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 three dials for gain tone and volume an aux in jack for MP3 players a headphone jack and an onoff switch But thats where the similarities end While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy sparkly sound of a tube amplifier the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH The low end presence on this thing even through a 20 set of entrylevel Sony headphones from Target is significantly greater than on the AC30 More importantly the sound doesnt deteriorate with higher volumes There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones but most of them become a staticfilled mess as soon as you turn up the volume Amazingly the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap and the overdrive is controlled through analog circuitry with amazing clarityBut the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak or claimed that there were no clean tones Yet with both my Les Paul and a Strat I was able to set the Volume at around 68 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume If any dirt was remaining a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem Even better playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamerlike blues tone This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Voxs website but I didnt believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that toneLong story short the Classic Rock is extremely powerful but more verstaile than I thought It can do the highgain Marshall tones I expected but also offers a wide array of clean or slightlyoverdriven tones It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30 The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both Highly recommend the Classic Rock 5 stars Awesome Marshall tone from a product that says Vox on it,positive
Ive owned over 3 dozen dirt boxes over the years and I just love the Rat It makes my tube halfstack sing and my practice amp sound like a big ampIts great as a stand alone distortion running on a clean amp It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins and everything inbetweenIt can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory Case in point my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70s in his garage Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14 speakers On its own you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect ACDC style overdrive out of itI think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability but the filter knob Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble but usually if you boost one you cut the other The filter is more of a high end roll off you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly but when you DO go brighter you still have the same bottom end It doesnt CUT the bass out So even with a more treble heavy sound you still have a fuller rounder tone it doesnt thin out so muchIts really an excellent pedal Ive heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the LM308 chip to really get the sound but thats a myth Look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones A Rat is a Rat whether theyre coming from China or the USAps Mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark So I dunno what that other guy was complaining about My goto distortion,positive
This is my first time buying a guitar without testing it firstI have no regretsAll of the positive reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent guitar model are spot onIf youre in the market and dont have a grand to spend on a new acoustic guitar get this North American made gemYou wont regret it Best Guitar for around 400,positive
Ive been using this one for about a year now with no problems I really like the durability and clear sound quality Durable and clear sound,positive
I bought a Glaesel Bridge this Glaesel rubber mute together I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews The mute fits the bridge fine but compared to a brass mute which of course works VERY well this mute seems to do absolutely nothing There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on Also the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noisesIf You want or need a mute for practicing quietly as many of us do I suggest you buy something else This item does not work and is a total waste of money I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon FYI that cheap little electric violin is an awesome fun item Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley aGlaesel SelfAdjusting 44 Violin Bridge Mediumwith itI consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all It does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way Does Not Work as a Mute if you need a practice mute buy something else,negative
I have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road I have not had this long enough to know if it will but so far so good no problems,positive
yes a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interioreasy to install strap locksuse on blue strat and looks greatenjoy works great,positive
Neither delighted nor disappointed I have not found it to be intuitive to use and the battery compartment is a joke but otherwise the construction is good I dont use it very much because I havent really figured out what I want to do with it and it is too big to fit in my briefcase full of blues harps so I have the behringer AB switch doing the job there Its OK,neutral
For the money it costs it worth it The construction seems good especially the kick drum pedal but the brains leave a little to be desired although its very functional The biggest complaint I have is that it only has 1834 stereo out and 1834 headphones out Really should be 1434 mono or stereo I bought a separate plug to allow this so I could put it into my mixer and Im good Worth the money,positive
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational Good price here too Hard to find just 10 mike cords Usually longer ones are only obtainable Does the job What more do you need,positive
Excellent product simple and practical designholds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zoneIf humidity levels in your area go below 40 you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks Good purchase to keep your guitar protected,positive
I always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal Never had such colorful ones though If you need picks do the math It pays ships fast as always There picks enought to last another few years,positive
I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar so after some research online and talking to friends I bought this capoIt goes on easilycomes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar Downside seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekendLet me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know Thanks Good capo and easy easy to use,positive
These are a new style of guitar pick to me Thought Id give it a try OKprobably didnt try long enough so I only rate it three stars because of my OPINION The seller did not fail me in any way These are a new stlye to me,neutral
Works like the picture shows Hangers adjust to required width of head stock Wood finish is nice look on the wall Simple and effective,positive
Work very well nice low profile easy push button on and off but it is true not good for thick straps And the Gold Tone ones discolor easy with minimal use Good,neutral
This is a very cheap little practice amp and I hoped Id be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my GF nuts Unfortunately I have a couple of problems the headphone and aux quality really wasnt that great and using great phones The sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier I just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to beFor quiet practice youre best getting a VOX Amplug IMHO Sounds great MUCH cheaper and integrates external audio better Does ONE thing well Just not well enough for me,neutral
I have stayed clear of using pedals for most of my playing carrier over 40 years but after installing a Fernandes FSK101 Sustainer kit and getting the same results as most other guys Too much sustain on adjacent strings which makes the whole experience a joke I decided to go ahead and try this compressor out and am very happy with the results I play mostly clean jazz blues rock and this unit gives me at least twice the sustain as I would normally get without any pedals Best with clean settings,positive
Added December 5Has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the 5 star rating stands without an asteriskAdded November 8I put the star back Ive got another one on one of my banjos It does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck either mine or the banjos to see it clearly but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and theres no neck to snapWhile it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddles scroll it seems firmly rooted to the banjos headstockOriginal November 4This tuner has a display like the SN8 rather than the SN1 after which it is named Its like any other Snark Super tight TunerIve taken off 1 star for two reasons1 I find I have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it Maybe its just a matter of finding the right place to put it Ill keep trying2 My music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time It was clamped solidly on the scroll but to do that and have it be comfortable to read the tuner was hanging down while playing Eventually it slipped off If it werent kept on this wouldnt be an issue but thats how the advertising shows the tuner being usedclamped to a guitar headstock hanging down Ill report back if it doesnt happen again for a while Even if this is an issue its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use so I still think its worth 4 stars Has there ever been a bad Snark tuner with this type of display,positive
Does a great job of checking cords Was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash Tests multiple types of cords also Nifty little tool,positive
Not too hard not too soft My friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using 36mm Everyone has their own preference and i just didnt like the feel of those I bought this 12 pack and they Are AWESOME I lost like 3 already but hey theres more I use them for my electric and acoustic guitar Love these picks,positive
Just changed strings on my Epi Les Paul and this windercutter performed flawlessly The winder fit the winding keys nicely and didnt come anywhere near touching my guitars finish The cutter snips the strings with no effort Huge time saver and works as promised Very glad I bought the Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter Works great,positive
This is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as Im concerned Its truebypass brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage accurate small footprint durable powers all your other pedals and is under 100 especially if bought usedits virtues are many and varied If youve been using a cheap crappy tuner like I was youll notice the difference all the moreIf you want a hyperaccurate tuner for some kind of technical work the Pitchblacks tolerances might not be quite what youre looking for But as far as stage tuners go its got a tighter tolerance than the Boss stompboxIf you want a buffer in your chain this pedal wont supply it as it is truebypassIf you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune this is not the pedal for you The output is muted while the tuner is engaged I prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune so for me this is a nonissue Plus I like being able to use the pedal as a killswitchThese are the only circumstances I can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a Pitchblack right this instantEDIT After some time with this pedal Ive noticed that when used to power other pedals some of them dont like being daisychained from this pedals power output most notably tremolos But when the daisychain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the Pitchblack is powered like any other pedal the problem vanishes Kind of strange and I figured worth noting here but I dont consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less Everything anyone needs in a stage tuner,positive
This is not my first Planet Waves locking strap They have never failed Though the selection of colors and widths are very very limited it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations Obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks But for me these work just fine Highly recommended Great Alternative to Straplocks,positive
I was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs It was exactly what I needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer For the price it does a very good job I dont detect any hum at all and I only get hiss when I crank the volume up too high I recommend this mixer for your home studio It works perfectly with my sound card You do NOT need USB to get this to work Great Mixer,positive
For the price I can hardly complain but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a Fender Strat replacement Checked it Against my American Standard MIM Strat and Squier and it would not fit any of them Should have just used one of my dogs chew bones and cut it myself would have been more accurate Ehhh Could be better,negative
I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrongMy expectations were frankly low I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability What I received was the polar opposite I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed itI am not wild about the strings that came stock but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withDAddario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings Light 1252 which while thick should make the instrument jazzfriendly I realize that flatwound strings will require a new setup and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investmentOut of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared to my novice eyes and fingers to be properly dressed I have already invested in a good but not great caseGuardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar I also uploaded a customerprovided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fitsFor the record I use the following amp which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitarKustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H HeadBottom line this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players The price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year Five stars for value and playability,positive

Nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern It fits my ovation quite snuggly I bought some retainers but found them unnecessary so far I couldnt remove this strap if I wanted to well I could but its just too much work So it will stay where it belongs for a few years at leastThe only thing I dont like about this strap is the edge of the strap is a bit abrasive on my bare neck Not a problem in the cooler months when Im prone to sweaters and such but in the summer it takes a bit of getting used to Its made of a canvassy cotton so its strong but its also a little rough Im going to try waxing the edge with canning wax or candle wax and see if that smooths it down a bitIt is a very nice strap and will last years I like it almost as much as my 40 year old ACE strap which is much softer due to 40 odd years of use and abuse by a multitude of musicians But finding an old ACE for anything close to this price is a fools journeyBuy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny Youll be ready solid strap will support you in all your efforts,positive
For the price this is a steal If you can snag a pack of new strings and it will sound tremendously better All in all with new strings I only spent about 30 on this uke and I think that is more than fairIf you cant get new strings the ones that come on it will survive you a little while but stock strings on any instrument are never great Also if you dont know how to to tune an instrumentdont have a tuner you dont need to buy one if you have a smartphone or iPod touch there are accurate tuning apps for nearly any instrument ukulele includedA little back story I used to play instruments when I was younger but stopped in my preteensearly teens Its something Ive recently been regretting more than ever So Im fixing that Not only am I relearning the instruments I played before but I picked up a new one the ukulele Like many others I was inspired by Amanda Palmer to do so Back to the reviewThe sound of the ukulele is great Its not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are After a week or so it has no trouble staying in tune and rarely needs adjustments Its very lightweight which is good but I dont think it would survive a fall Its a fingerprint magnet but thats about the only gripe I have I plan on stickering and painting it anyway The gig bag as other as said is basically just a dust jacket Im cool with that because that says to me that the majority of the money I spent on this ukulele really was for the ukulele not the extrasFor the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose I was worried that Id regret not shelling out another 20 or 30 for a more frequently recommended ukelele but I dont regret it at allIts pretty easy to learn especially if you have the littlest bit of musical knowledge or experience Even if you dont it shouldnt take you too long to be playing some songs You have the gift of internet where there is information everywhereThis ukelele is perfect for a beginner or for someone who wants a cheap backup or travel option Plus its not costly so if it breaksgets loststolenyou choose to upgrade you havent lost a whole lot of moneyThis would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument My little brother has been nagging me to get him a ukulele since I got oneThats about all I will update if any problems arise in timeDont hesitate If youre new dont worry about spending 50 on something else I mean if you can and want to go ahead This will be more than fineEdit Apparently this thing fluctuates between 2030 I was 2495 when I got it If its 30 wait a few days and see if it goes down I mean its worth the money but if you can save a little and spent that extra 5 on a new pack of strings that would be even betterI give it 4 stars and not 5 simply because while I have not played other ukuleles I am certain that there ARE better Thats just how it is The more you spend the better But this is definitely pretty solid over all for what it is and how much it costs Super sweet,positive
I have purchased three of the Fender f neck plates for three different MIM Strats They all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool Neat product,positive
Ive played guitars for over 40 years and Ive owned or used many many tuners stompbox rackmount etc This is a great tuner I bought a clipon tuner about 10 years ago when they were first becoming popular It was ok fairly accurate very convenient but its sensitivity would make it difficult to tune the low E This Snark is much better I compared it to my Boss TU2 which is the standard stompbox tuner of gigging musicians and its just about as accurate The fact that its chromatic means you can tune to any note which is useful for nonstandard tunings It even has a builtin mic for situations where you cant clip it on say for a lapsteel guitar The head swivels to just about any position and its sensitivity allows you to tune in live situations when other instruments are playing The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that because of its curved arm its a little awkward to pack for traveling if you were to cram it into a space and there was some pressure on it I could see the arm possibly breaking off from the spring part So to me outside of that and the fact that it only comes in red so far its perfect Great little unit,positive
We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals Its not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs 150 200 250 350whatever There are a LOT of really expensive distortionOD pedals out thereIve had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix I generally use the Bad Monkey for midgain crunch tones and for that its just fantasticHaving two tone controls makes all the difference This pedal is Tubescreameresque but not as midrangeheavy as a TS Anyway this thing sounds great Excellent classic rock and lead tonesThe things it WONT do 1 a clean boost It has plenty of output but theres always a little bit of dirt in the signal so it cant be used as a pure clean boost 2 it wont clean up when you turn your guitar downor at least not much No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifullyBut despite those limitations the Bad Monkey is awesome At the very least it can be a great throw in your case to take to a jam pedal but its worth having on your pedalboard as well Much better than it has a right to be,positive
Microphone is quite good for such price The sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones Recommend for small budget studios Good Mic for good price,positive
The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place All you have to do is cut the cable flush insert it into the plug with a twisting motion and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tightAs a benefit if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable remove the plug cut the cable and insert the end back into the plugGreat rightWell not reallyAs far as reliability goes nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered With the money you spend you could easily get a decent soldering iron some old cable and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice In the end you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as neededI have used this product and had to recut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble but I have experienced problems in the past Always have a few spares that have been testedAnother annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficientIs it easier than soldering YesAre they reliable For the most part yesWill I continue using the product Yes because I usually have sparesWhy do I use them then Im lazyThis is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectorsDont waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors The thin soft gold 510 microns flash plating looks cool but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off The brass eventually tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contactsIt is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs Handy yes the be all and end all NO,neutral
This is a very quite tube and has all the gain youd expect from a great 12AX7 tube If your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick Tungsol 12AX7 preamp tube,positive
Cheap and good Just what I needed No issues in over a year Must less expensive and just as good as others Works great,positive
Attaching hardware is a bit cheap but over all it is better than I expectedBag was ripped so I almost lost the screw and washerThis will work fine for me I think Better than I expected,positive
I like these humidifiers Works if you keep it with instrument in your case and upkeep is minimal Work on all strings very well but be careful easy to fall out of case so just be careful Herco my hero,positive
This is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric I did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close Not too bad,positive
Holy guacamole you guys this ampI was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUNDTook the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase then decided to try once moreFired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFFSo rockingI actually got this for my acousticelectric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it I keep the volume low and the door open about 134 to get a cleanish tone Havent cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but Im sure itll sound awesome too Its so funky I can smell it,positive
I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup This is my first set and I am impressed These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic ampI would purchase these again for my needs Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were more flexible in light form but great also It would be a toss up for me between the two but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously Bright sounding uncoated strings,positive
This little box will give it to you I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains I count in my little arsenal with fuzz distorions auto wah a compressor octaver bass booster and a nice DI Box The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to recuperate definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love A great little boxSo if you are looking for clarity definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trickCheers Looking for definition,positive
I bought this two years ago for use with a Takamine It hasnt seen heavy use It wasnt supposed to It sits in a corner of the living room holds the guitar securely and doesnt cause problems Although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious and my 91 yo neighbor was convinced for a year that I was drunk and wailing away on the guitar at 3 am At least thats what she told the policeThis stand is very similar to the slightly better selling Musicians Gear stand They might actually be the same stand under different names The pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping If I were to buy a stand again I would still get this one because its available under Prime The other one isnt That gives this stand more valueThe stand is very easy to set up The lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar This took a little getting used to but it does work very well The padding on the stand does protect my guitar well Extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problemsGiven the very low price this is an excellent choice for a living room stand If youre on the road or performing you might need something a bit different but I can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself Two years old and still going strong,positive
This installed easily A nice feature is ability to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument When the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain I might have had with earlier straps A keeper for sure Flexible feels good,positive
Ive had an old beginner Ukulele sitting in a closet for years I have much nicer ones now and decided that rather than lend them out for playing Id fix up this beginner uke as a loaner I took off the strings and realized how dull and dry looking the fret board had become I used this product and it really soaked it up fast Now it looks beautiful again Very satisfied with how it worked works,positive
I picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised The sound is very authentic as I have a 60s tube Champ in excellent working order for reference as well as a DevilleThis little amp has the classic Fender tube sound with a broad punchy tone and the right amount of compression The included digital effects vibraphone delay reverb chorus and tremolo are all convincing and well executedThe modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ tweed deluxe cleandirty baseman 65 princeton cleandirty 65 deluxe cleandirty 65 twin and an array of british and metal ampsAll and all a super practice amp or micable performance amp Great job FenderPS I dont review products that dont stand out as excellent Great and versatile,positive
These are great picks and YES they are slipperyThe reason is the material and method of manufacturingDelflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding Unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directionsThese are probably the brightest sounding picks I have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to themI use the 61MM for 10s on my solid body electrics 76mm for my 11s on semi and hollow bodiesand 104mm on my Bass guitar thats right I use a plectrum on my BassYou can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like Nylon Injection molded picks not stamped,positive
It is so small that it cannot hold all mics If you have a big lopsided kick drum mic with a skinny neck and akward COGAKG D112 this stand will not be able to hold it up It can however hold up the Audix D6 and it can hold an SM 57 up to a guitar cab if its the right height I love this because it has allowed me to mic things in really really tight spaces I would never have had room to use full sized instrument mic stands in some of the tiny stages I have seen this summer This thing takes up very little real estate I have put this thing in the pocket of my jeans before Love this stand,positive
This is a wonderful product for the price Ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain A little difficult to set up properly but if you are running an eq separate then you only have to adjust the input and output I dont care much for the tube display with led lights behind it but it doesnt bother me either Behringer makes great products at incomparable prices Great cheap preamp,positive
I am very disappointed The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar bodyIt is unusable until repairedUpdate It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller Amazon and have not received any communication Very disappointed with the seller Amazoncom LLC,negative
Im a huge fan of DAddario strings They hold their tone tuning longer than others Ive tried and when you buy the bulk packs you cant go wrong on quality value Wouldnt play anything else,positive
I purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason I useOn Stage SS7761B Tripod Speaker Stands which are light duty but awkward to carry This case solves that problem When I mentioned light duty in the title I truly meant it While I gig twenty times per month nearly all are totally acoustic with a small powered speaker for rooms where the pianistvocalist has to project over a grand piano On very rare occasions do we need a full PA and that is where this case comes in handy Moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward Transporting them in this case isntThese hold up beautifully if used three or four times per month when a full PA is needed I am not sure I would want them for the heavier all metal speaker stands because the weight would quickly wear the case out It has reinforced stress points but I still feel those are not adequate for heavier standsYou can easily fit the two stands that I mentioned above and aOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand The side pocket is good for incidentals like XLR to 14 inch adapters patch cables and the likeBottom line this case is for occasional use only and even then for lighter stands I awarded it five stars because it does exactly what I need and is not touted to be anything but a light weight case For light duty and weekend warriors,positive
use it on acoustic and electric always lose them before i ever wear them out I dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker Personal favorite,positive
Fast shipping great price and most of all great stings very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend Great Srings,positive
Works as advertised Makes the fretboard look and feel nice I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when youre changing your strings Good stuff,positive
This is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board I like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking I find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle I dont use it much with single coils since they dont seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone built solid a quality pedal that should hold up well A Good Boost for Humbuckers,positive
Im always looking for the perfect electric guitar strings as is evidenced by my drawer full of spare string sets that I felt failed me for one reason or another A set of these came my way as I had just gotten a 1966 Fender Jaguar I did what I always do when I get a new guitar I restring it even though the strings were practically new I could immediatly tell the difference in both feel sound The sound was crisper than the super slinkys that were on it they felt good to my fingers The only reason I took them off was because the Jag was for surf music I wanted heavier gauge so I put these on my Tele which was a match made in heaven They sounded great but most telling is that after a month or so of heavy usage they still sound great Reasonable price great sound long lasting To me thats a perfect combo Highly recommended I like,positive
This was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings He found just what he needed and at a great price Ernie Ball Regular Slinky String Set,positive
I have tried a few types of strings on my p90 Epiphone Les Paul and I find these Ernie Ball Power slinky 11s to have a lot of power and punch to them as advertised and give me the nice tone I was looking for The power and thick sound is due to these strings being a heavier gauge than the strings that usually come with a guitar It will take a little more finger strength to play these but it is worth getting used to These strings work well with the many different types of rock I play and will work even fine with drop c tuning They have also been as durable as strings get and do not lose their tone for quite some time I prefer these power slinkys over Daddario xl 10s over regular slinky 10s which I used to like until I tried these and even prefer them over the more expensive full nickel Rock n roll slinky 10s which surprisingly sounded boring when compared to the energy the power slinkys give you I would say the power slinkys give off a sufficiently bright sound but not excessively bright and I would recommend them to anyone thinking about giving them a try Best Sound From my p90 Les Paul,positive
Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity A must have for us dry Californians Seems to do the trick,positive
I needed a phaser and saw that the Joyo Vintage Phaser was rated well and super cheap so I bought it I was EXTREMELY impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals This was one of their toprated pedals so I figured Id give it a go I have to say that I am fairy impressed I get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box anything from a light fuzz to a vintagestyle high gain You wont get a modern metal crunch from it so if thats what youre looking for look elsewhere If you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the 70s and 80s then this is a great bet This pedal is currently plugged in and I suspect that Ill keep it as part of my rig unless I happen to get rich and find a nicer boutique pedal or get around to modding my other pedalsAs a reference I own several Boss distortionover drive pedals Japanese DS1 SD1 OD3 and MT2 I The Joyo JF02 and OD3 are the two drive pedals that I have hooked up since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that I currently ownA sidenote for the tonefreaks The peddle does seem to be a bit muddy Its great for jamming out power chords but not so articulate when youre arpeggiating chords Still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp Cant be beat for the price,positive
I only have two pedals but that was one outlet spot too many and it really makes a difference when youre onstage with only one power strip Now I just wish I had an attachment that would let me charge my laptop and iPhone from the same plug as the pedals Cant always get what you want Exactly what I needed,positive
heavy duty pretty sturdy finish is not the best in the world but it certainly does the job it was intended for holds secure and adjusts easily heavy duty folding music stand,positive
These are perfect Hard to beat strings They last keep in tune and keep their tone They dont need any string cleaners either So you can save money on that An obvious noticeable difference between the Medium gauge and the Light is that these Medium gauge are not recommended if you like to fingerpick a lot But boy Are they bright Enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees Great guitar strings,positive
Over the past couple of months Ive been replacing guitar straps This one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap And it would be but the holes are too tight Really a major chore to get over a strap button I had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap Ive probably bought dozens of straps over the past fortyplus years and I never had this problem until the latest straps Ive purchasedso this strap isnt the only one with which Ive had an issue A tightfitting strap isnt in itself a problem except when one needs to take it off Yikes Otherwise this is a nice strap Oh I tried the strap on three guitars just to be sure the first wasnt an anomaly Almost a Winner,neutral
Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster Solid unit good material and construction though it is made in China apparentlybut hey thats why its such a bargain seems great for both acoustic and electric,positive
As a huge Gilmour fan it was a no brainer to pick these strings up Had been playing DR and Elixer for the past couple of years and to my recollection have never tried ghs This custom gauge set plays great They tuned right up with very little stretching I will buy these again Great Strings,positive
Ive been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011 Its great in all ways but one The rubber feet constantly fall off If you use this bench regularly the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feetSolution UseGorilla Glue Epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench This is what I have done and now I have no problem with wandering feet On Stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble Glue not included,positive
Easy to use No metallic hiss youd normally expect The only real drawback is the lack of presence when it comes to the bassier strings It takes some skill to EQ things to the point of normalcy If youre uncomfortable dealing with EQ this might not be your best bet Otherwise a wonderful product at a great price Almost Amazing,positive
I used this to replace a Pot in my MIM Telecaster Works great I didnt notice any change in tone It just worked like the old one But the main this is that it worked And my Tele sounds as great as it always did worked great,positive
Although The cloth I got was black and not yellow just pointing that out It works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror I can see my reflection perfectly clear Works great,positive
Its a stand it does what its supposed too That being said I try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable I use these to put my instrument down for a short time only These are by far some of the better made ones Ive found without a contraption to 34lock in34 my instrument and give a false sense of security These are made no where near how they used to be 20 years ago in a negative way but the foam medical piping has gotten better as the old stuff used to scuff and deteriorate really quickly Id prefer a better stand however I question its existence Reasonable,neutral
I started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in December of 2012 and continue to do so to this very day He absolutely swears by them He does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in Hawaii makes them prone to rusting Other than that the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality He highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there Great Electric Guitar Strings,positive
A great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps The guides on these are not rollers but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon The only guides that I like better are the round 50s guides for Teles but then I like those asthetically only on Teles An inexpensive mode that looks and works great To the inexperienced eye this simple clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models A clean looking and functional upgrade,positive
Let me start by saying that I never even opened these Ive given it a 3 star merely out of respect for Hohner I have no clue how they play so youll have to look at other review for that infoI ordered this product based on the fact that the description states Includes a deluxe red pro type hard shell case Well not from Music123 it doesnt When I asked Music123 about this they said oh well we provide Amazon with our catalogue and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items REALLYNot only did this not come in the red case which I didnt really care about anyway it didnt come in any version of this case style which I was interested in The case thats shown is the case thats sold individually on many sites for 19 So I figured wow what the heck Im getting 7 harmonicas that cost 6 a piece if puchased individually and Im getting a 19 case with them Youd be silly not to bite on that right Well they came in a cheaper nondescript black zipper case not the one with the Hohner logo on it Save your money and order this through Musicians Friend Its the same price free shipping and you get the actual item as its described on their siteIn closing its been a week since I sent this product back to Music123 and I still have not received my refund Do yourself a favor and avoid them Avoid if Sold by Music123,neutral

As LC condenser its definitely a light weight but for lesse than a 100 bucks it sounds pretty goodUsed on acoustic guitar with less than satisfatory results but got a great sound out of a violin and a fairly decent voice soundLooking forward to more tests Great price,positive
It is a good price works fine to connect my wha wha pedal to my ampli4 stars because nothing is perfect but Im happy with it Good,positive

This stand is made of quality products It cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right This is our second one as we both have guitars Worth every penny Good stand,positive
I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long so i did get to play em but all my strings except the A E popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar which it came with btw the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn have to use pliers sometimes but the strings sound great if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w medium gauge elixirs Ok strings,neutral
I thought these would give me more volume and a better feel for stumming my uke I dont use them much at all preferring palin hand strumming to what these deliver OK at best,neutral
This was one of those might as well get one of these too while Im at it purchases when I was ordering guitar polish Its a good cloth for polishing no more to say about it Works fine as a polishing cloth,positive
I was hell bent of getting an analog delay and the local shop didnt have the one that I was looking for MXR Carbon Copy so they recommended that I try out the TC Flashback Digital Delay instead This is priced comparably to the Carbon Copy but it has so many more features I guess thats expected of a digital delay that I couldnt pass it upSimilar to the other TC product that I purchased Corona Chorus this sounds great its feature rich and easy to useThe analog and tape delay modes do a very nice job of emulating the sound I wanted to get from the analog Carbon Copy but it also has tons of other settings to pull out a digital sound think exact repeats and a delay of up to 6 seconds Shorter delays can be had by switching to the slap back mode which puts this pedal into instant RockABilly modeThis is tone print enabled a feature that I have yet to try but it seems like a cool concept has a tap tempo setting and a 40 second looper all in one small delay boxThis is the first delay that Ive owned and Im not looking back Fantasic Delay,positive
This cable seems like it will last me for a while As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do Decent mic cable,positive
We got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night He really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by but not too bright that it hurts his eyes A good buy I could see where this could be useful in other applications like on a music stand but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed night light,positive
If you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what you need You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one Absolute necessity,positive
Tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner excellent,positive
This Tascam US100 USB Audio Interface is exactly what I was looking for to record from our wireless mic with XLR outputs directly to my PC video editing software We professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage Before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the PC so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio Here are my observations Plug and Play connected to my PC via USB and was instantly recognized USB Powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop Good Sound clean and clear input Multiple Inputs XLR 14 Mic RCA stereo line and HiZ GuitarMisc XLR input is not powered not a problem for us Includes Audacity software but we did not need to load itHighly RecommendedCFH Perfect For My Needs Highly Recommended,positive
I really like these strings While they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings they still sound better than many other strings AND they last so much longer They will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x probably closer to 3x Nice tactile feel on the right hand with reduced squeak as you move up down the neckBottom line is Elixirs sound great play well and least a really long time I really like these strings,positive
Wanted to review this pedal because I felt some of the other reviews were a little lukewarm Distortion is incredibly subjectiveit depends on your rig and your tastes But the Badass 78 by MXR is a very nice pedal for a decent price It doesnt do metal or super highgain but offers some nice classic rock tones and can be quite warm if you back off on the tone knob The crunch button adds brightness and volume and may or may not be too harsh for your setup However the tone knob does do a pretty good job of rolling back the high end especially if you activate the crunch buttonThe build quality seems to be pretty good though I should note that while the pedal is the same size as other MXR pedals it is significantly lighter I suppose this could make it more susceptible to denting and damage if it travels but it should be plenty durable for 95 of users I really like the switch on this one too its easy to press and clearly clicks on once depressed One minor annoyance if you use the crunch setting is that the blue light which is annoyingly bright like an LED headlight stays on EVEN when the pedal itself is off This can be quite distracting if you rely on the lights on your pedal board to tell you which effects are on Not really a major gripe that detracts from the pedals quality but a frustrating design decisionBasically if you get the right setup youll get great tone I got this pedal specifically to try and find a better alternative to the BOSS DS1 which lacks mids and can sound harshabrasive The MXR 78 Badass is definitely superior in that regard but a lot will depend on your rig and settings I find that this pedal really excels on playing single notes on the lower strings think Walk this Way by Aerosmith or Hangingaround intro by Counting Crows And if you pair it with a fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal you could probably thicken it up a bit for higher solos Great pedal Fullbodied crunchy alternative to the BOSS DS1,positive
gets the job done I would say it muffles too much though my arm feels like it went to the gym after a jam session gets the job done,positive
These strings sound great play great and the coating really does keep down the squeaking Some purists dont like the coating movement when it comes to strings and it does take a micron off the treble but they last a loooong time I usually only have to change my strings once a month I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar and play rock folk and country strumming They rock and I feel they are the best strings around today period These strings are very small and are great for playing for long periods of time without brutalizing the fingertips Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording and you probably have less of a bass boom but I like em Best strings on the planet,positive
Its a very fair price and is made well It seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around The only thing that worries me is that once the bottom piece swiveled and dropped my guitarand this was when I just set it down not a few seconds before it fell Id recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure its secure Im not sure how 34on stage34 ready this is Its a good cheap stand though and for the price point I understand the sacrifices they made in the design Great buy,positive
This is a lower quality Leather StrapProsCheapLeatherEasy adjustment designConsLeather was low quality rough and hard to the touchLeather had scrape marks on front and back of strapEyelits for attaching to guitar are not incredibly tight I need strap locks to feel safe with the strapLeather lacks give and is rough rubs neck and shoulder and digs into flesh with heavier guitars or baseIt is an OK strap not great but cheap You get what you pay for,neutral

super tight and very accurate im not a fenfer fan but I really love this tuner I recommend this one to anyone i love this,positive
Bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc Works just fine In fact bought a 2nd one that stays on my workbench for powering various items being tested or worked on Has all the adapters I needed Great for all stomp boxes,positive
This is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storagetransport and it cradles the guitar nicelyTwo minor issues1 Personal gripe the git leans back a bit more than I would like Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs2 Product gripe the two footer bars are not quite level with each other so it rocks just a little bit However with a solid body electric on it even a little rocking can be a really bad thingI like OnStage and own several of their products They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one Ive been applying a little persuasion to even it out and its getting better but with the relatively robust construction it just doesnt want to give much Kinda sucks that its not level out of the box so 4 stars Nice stand that is easy to use,positive
OK quality and certainly better than a piece of rope I found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile Nice for the dough,neutral
This thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand Of course one might think that would translate into sturdy and one would be correct Super simple to use No buttons levers or knobs Just pop it open It doesnt have an actual mechanical locking feature but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place It holds my acoustic securely and I have no fear that its going to tip over on its own When youre done just nudge the outer legs to unlock them and its super easy to fold back upI had a Fender mini acoustic stand but it didnt fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so I figured I would try this one I am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter HOWEVER I can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 275 thickness If Hercules could have figured a way to avoid that this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine Its still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag but I think the Marketing guys used a little creative license with that description Either that or theyre comparing it to the Cosmo year end recap issue Still a great little stand and I would buy it again if needed Heavy duty stuff,positive
The winder works well for me and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool so I dont have to search out a pair of snips but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward Also the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy and doesnt work well for reluctant pins I actually like my Dunlop winder better this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more but I guess thats the compromise of having a working cutter so I wont be throwing away my other winder any time soon Works well but not perfect,positive
This is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try I recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable Doesnt tangle up,positive
I have to admit this up front Im a terrible bass player I play guitar and keep a bass in the music room for times when I have friend over to jam I do dabble with the bass but Im not proficient with it That being said I really appreciate the difference these strings make in sound playability and durability These strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time They have 34punch34 and 34snap34 which are good things to have in a bass I havent had them on for a real long time but in the time Ive had them they remain consistent and show absolutely no sound or metal degradation in the time theyve been on my Fender MIM Jazz bass When I need another set Ill buy these Great strings,positive
First of all this is a 40 7guitar stand Its not a highend 200 pro stand That being said the materials are decent It seems strong and stable I would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig I bought it to have a convenient place to keep our 5 guitars and basses handy Rather than having 5 individual stands this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neatThe metal is decent but if you tighten the screws too much the metal does flexwarpSo far so good Pretty Decent,positive
I admit I got this from Guitar Center on clearance but over the past week or so Ive had it I just love plugging into it Ive got a great vintage larger amp but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions and Im anticipating spending some time in apartment living so I was looking for a small tubebased amp This thing gives great tone with both a Strat and a Les Paul clone and an overdrive pedal works very well with it Of course its not too loud thats the whole point I should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps dont have but its really low volume Also the tubes do take a minutes to warm up and since it doesnt have a standby switch you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in But it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears or those of anyone else Great little amp Every bit the small amp you want,positive
There was nothing wrong with my original neckplate but I was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra IT was a direct replacement for the original Just a lil extra bling,positive

Ive used Shubb for years I strayed briefly on a Fender Smart capo You can read my review on that item I really liked it at first and in my review I said I was converted from Shubb Im back to Shubb The Fender is plastic and it works fine on my electrics but not as well as on my acoustic The Shubb works great on both If you just buy a Shubb to begin with you wont ever have to waste money on trying out different capos It will not clamp on to your headstock so if you like having a capo sticking out of your guitar when youre not using it then this isnt it My favorite capo,positive
This is a great pick for all those that use picks but need a softer sound occasionally Much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up The only negative is the way they seem to be packed here They come in three colors and the colors stand for soft medium hard They also come in 3 and 5mm which is the size of the grip thickness where you grip the pick The white is soft the medium grey is medium and the dark grey is hard I use the white and medium grey in 31mm and find that easy to adjust too They are soft and they do wear fairly quickly but you just keep playing them or do a little cutting to sharpen them back up You get a nice soft tone and just like using any other plectrum you develop a picking style to get various tones double bass acoustic finger style etc I use the soft picks for a smooth tone and the medium pick for a deep jazzy sound think Motown I never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bagFor a real trip if you are able to finger pick try out the Jam Cat pick holder sold here It is so easy to switch from finger to pick in an instant and it is always there when you need to rock it up a bit Great Bass Guitar Plectrum For Finger Style Tone,positive

I bought these to replace a pair of ATHM45s I had for 6 years I used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio These have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully I play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what I hear inside the headphones Listening to music on them is a joy Everyone has an opinion about a 34burn in34 period mine seemed to open up at about 5060 hours I listen to music about 3 4 hours a day Best audiophile headphones for around 100,positive

I picked up this pedal used along with DS1 Keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think Long story short the mod DS1 is getting returned and Im keeping my Fulltone OCDFirst a word about the negative reviewsit tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something but the 13 other reviews as of Sept 2012 were all 5star reviews It tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didnt know what the pedal was before they tried it And anyone complaining about the price this is a handcrafted pedal that is extremely well constructed the inside circuitry is pristine and built to last for decades I think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremostNow lets talk about how the pedal sounds Its marketed as an overdrivedistortion I had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because I indicated I was looking for a distortion pedal but I was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has It is much more an overdrive in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp but boosts the level in gain in a very full rich sound The sound has a lot of bass to it but unlike a Tubescreamer TS9 its definitely not muddy In fact if youre tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act this might be exactly what you needThe battery is accessible behind 4 hand screws and moderately involved to get to but an AC adapter is really the way to go Its a standard plug like you find on BOSS and Ibanez pedals but you can use a 9V or 18V Ive read some reviewers say that 18V gives you more headroom while some actually prefer the 9V sound Honestly I tried both and didnt discern any difference it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinetsFinally there is an LPHP switch and its really a matter of preference and setup how you use it Ive been mostly using the LP setting which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that I hate But in a live setting or to use it as a boost for soloing the HP setting could be quite useful as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to cut through the other instruments on stageIf I had to summarize this pedal I would describe it as a Tubescreamer you can rock with Which is not to say that its better than the Tubescreamer necessarily but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone Put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your goto for rhythmchord sections soloing or both Like a Tubescreamer you can rock with,positive
Ive been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately and this is my favorite purchase as of late Ive bought nice straps but when Im practicing for hours at a time this foot rest is a great reprieve and literally a weight off my shoulders Great for Practice Sessions,positive

No way this thing cost lest than 40 I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised This compares very closely to my high end OD pedals I ownin a metal case BONUS Im super happy with my Joyo pedals Wicked Nice,positive
I cant write a great review for this Theres nothing to write about This is a pick holder It holds my picks End of story Price was right Its what youd expect,positive
They sound just like i thought they would I love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesomeI would buy these again Very Nice,positive
Trustable quiet good materials durable etc Maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalB bcuz of their large plugheads but they do a perfect job with my guitar signaland honestly for me thats what I need Good stuff to have Must have at least one pack,positive
I agree with all the other 5 star reviews the quality of these strings is excellentThey last with great tone for a reasonable time and dont breakI just have a helpful hint for those people with little experience in restringing an acoustic guitar that has removable bridge pins Put a crimp or bend in each string about 34 of an inch or so from the ball at the end about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string fairly sharp Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar out of the way of the pin Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin The pin should fit tightly into the hole and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin not below it Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin After pushing in the pin you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole keeping it tight It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar but I cant see in there to verify this is so but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin Not upwardHope this helps some novices I had to learn it this way myself Helpful hint during restringing,positive
I recently picked up the TC Electronic MojoMojo Overdrive at a steal of a price but Im evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price I own many different overdrives including light overdrives in the Tubescreamer and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous Blues Driver OCD Joyo Ultimate Drive etc To me this is closer to the Tubescreamer family as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive Actually the separate knobs for Bass and Treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the Digitech Bad MonkeyBUILD QUALITY Outstanding It has an MXR style click button press but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last The 9V jack is on the top out of the way of the IO jacks The battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screwbutton that you can easily get open with your fingers or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver The thing is dense and build solid as a rock I always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crushresistant and tend to get punted around by your cables Finally the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback and several of them are actually notched to settle into the 12 position which is a nice touchTONE QUALITY Obviously the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review I would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a 5 and absolutely loved it as several previous reviewers did But based on the pedals I have used and my experiences with the MojoMojo it feels more like a 4 to me The tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy Whether the mod switch is a boost or a cut the pedal is bassier in the up position Dont get me wrong I definitely appreciate the abundance of lowend frequencies but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through I could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments It does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character However if youd like a similar effect with a much more expressive and brighter output try the Mad Professor Sweet Honey Overdrive or its clone companion the Joyo Sweet Baby OverdriveEASE OF USEVERSATILITY Many overdrives only have the single tone control so I was excited to see controls for Bass and Treble Still I feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps and very muddy with others I will update my review if my feelings change as I have a few different combinations I want to try out I feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion This is much the way you would use a Tubescreamer I will say that it is one of the more tubelike overdrives I have tried Hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone Attack them harder and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup much like a tube amp However if your hope is simply to plug into the MojoMojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal Warm tubelike overdrivebooster with voicing you may or may not like,positive
Great product I have ordered 6 or 7 or these Great product I have ordered 6 or 7 or,positive
Other than that when you need 1032 rack screws these are the real McCoy Wide enough pan to grab the ear narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear Thanks Raxxess 25 Screws why not 24 Even numbers would be nice,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit Theres no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great This has that Old Tube Amp reverb Sound for a great price,positive
works exactly like its ad says it would eliminates pops and secondary noises in the background easy to install nice looking pop filter,positive
I was looking forward to trying these as Ive loved this companys product since day oneBut I think theyve messed around with the gauge slapped a meaningless 34HD34 tag on and added a few bucks to the price More profit in someones pocket for marketing jargonI have a smallerbodied guitar so these should have by their claim given me better balance but imho the opposite happened The bottom dropped out the top end stopped sizzling and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pickWhen I play with fingers its better but not worth spending more money on than the normal 012s Ive been using which I think I liked a lot betterIts possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for color me skeptical but Id say if youre happy with what you have you need not try theseAgain longtime user and big fan but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly 34HD34 moniker no thanks Im a BIG Fan of Elixir Strings But,negative

The mounting process was simpleRecommendation Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you dont already have one You dont want your instrument plummeting to the floorI got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers Theyre holding up very well The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall Whether thats a good thingis up to you I guess I dont have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped So maybe it is a good thingBe careful when you hang it though It could definitely hit the wall if you dont place it on the hanger carefully Very easy to assemble,positive
I have to edit my once five star review because twice in a row I recieved a tuner in the mail and after less than one week the screen goes totally dim I Cant imagine this is the battery since that is supposed to last a year and I only used the tuner 45 times for less than a minute each time Its so dim I can barley see the reading when I squint Its only 10 just a pain to wait two weeks for amazon to give a refund Ill be buying another one and trying it again Good tuner unlucky with two lemons I guess Two were dead after 3 days third times the charme,neutral
50 years giggingowned it all 4 or 5 times wanted a cheap delay pedal to go into the fx loop of a newly purchased blackstar ht 5c rsince ive purchased several joyo pedals in the last year i looked for a joyo digital delayit works perfectly doesnt color the sound silent switching and the knobs give all the control youd ever need its well built and i expect it to last longer than me i highly reccomend this delay pedal excellent delay pedal,positive
I was in a local music store the other day and noticed a huge stack of these cymbals with a few examples mounted on stands to try While theyre not as rich as Zildjians or Paistes or other more expensive cymbals they do have that trashy sound that you look for in a China And at the asking price who can resist Not bad,positive
I like these picks for use with my ukulele it makes strumming a lot easier on these old hands of mine It sounds exactly like the sound you make while strumming with your fingers and they seem to be sturdy enough to last awhile A worthwhile buy for tired fingers Soft comfy and effective,positive
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people The strap is about 6 too short for my Seagull S6 guitar I will say the build quality is great but too short is and remains too short I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap I just cant understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short2222013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and short of all this is you will have to fork over another 30 to buy an extendo for this strap I dont quite understand why they dont make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another 30 to make it work right in the first place heres a link to the extendo optionLEVYS LEATHERS MMGXL25BRN STRAP EXTENDER qid1361565768sr82keywordsMMGXL25 the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate futureThis is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap Its sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other I will keep this strap but sure feel like Ive been had on this purchase the terms bait and switch come to my mind Way too short for a dreadnought guitar DO NOT BUY THIS STRAP,negative

Once you install a full Dunlop Strap Lock on a guitar and strap that strap becomes unusable on any guitar that isnt equipped with Dunlop buttons Since I only use about 3 straps but have more than 3 guitars it didnt make much sense to buy full strap locks My only concern when I ordered these buttons was that they might not be exactly like the Dunlops and not securely keep the guitar and strap connectedThese buttons look and act exactly like the ones that come with a full set of strap locks After testing a set I have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars The side benefit is that they are fully functional when used with a guitar strap that is not equipped with the Dunlop locks As good as can be expected,positive
I bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and I love it I use the pedal as a preamp going into a PA or poweramp The pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind I use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite It is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar I have a VFE Alpha Dog and an MXR Custom Badass OD before the pedal After the pedal I use an MXR phase and Flanger VFE Blueprint Delay and then a Byang Triverb When all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when I am not going through a more traditional amp rig Buy the pedal its great Amazing tone,positive
This is real bone The length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar It is just my luck that I have some sandpaper in my garage so I sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about 10 minutes of sanding Real Bone but You should buy a sand paper to go along with ith,positive
This is a nice little tuner It is small easy to read and use It has a nonbacklit LCD display of an analog VU style meter with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat It has a green LED and large mark for being on target It has a builtin mic for acoustic instruments and a mono 14 inch phone jack for electric instruments It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410480hz It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change If you have any vision problems the display might be an issue The LCD is about 1 12 inches long and 34 of an inch high and like all nonbacklit LCD displays has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issuesI wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making and it works adequately for that The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout As it is it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound So you know you are tuned to a C you just dont know exactly which C it is Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument but in some cases would be very handy to know I suppose with more training and experience I could learn to tell that by ear What Learn a skill Isnt that asking a bit muchI suppose for an inexpensive tuner that is the tradeoff but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes Other than that it seems to work well It is consistent easy to use and compact I consider it about average in value it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device I may be expecting too much for the price as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of threeIn any case if you dont need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning this works quite well and is not very expensive missing one important function,neutral
Wanted to hang my guitars on the wall These Hooks are padded and rotate a little Provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars The difficulty in installing was I wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud I had to attach them to a wood board that I attached to the wall This also provided a additiional 3434 separation from the wall The guitars are less likely to bang on the wall I bought 3,positive
ive used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect very easy to grip and last long one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind highly recommand this for anyone needs pick good guitar pick,positive

I needed a Jack Plate for my custom Stratocaster build and ordered this one It was far better than I expected It is very heavy duty great chrome plating Not at all what I expected for the money A definite quality part worthy of this project that will be with me for life Nothing but the best going on this guitar including this plate Perfect for my custom build,positive
But is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with Use a plugin instead I like some of Behringer products even though they are snobbed This particular unit is not one of their finest products but I give them credit for the price point and effort Someone will appreciate it but not me It sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as its not defective but just not up to what I want Cheap so no big loss Probably good for an aspiring guitarist that plays live,neutral
I like this product The screen is big and easily read The meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle the note sharp or flat and by the background color going green to red It takes 23 seconds to hear the string but then it locks right in for all notes even the low E Its really easy to use and Im really happy with it Its so much better than my Korg CA1 The only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel It takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position An additional swivel would make it perfect Good Product,positive
This compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop It doesnt take a lot of space on my pedal board and its simple to use Ive used the Boss RC20 and the Digitech Stereo Jam Man Although the others have more features I like this little pedalIt took a little time to get use to the one button operation but I find this to be very reliable Ive owned mine since the day they came out and I have had no issues Perfect little looper,positive
In my humble opinion the pictures make the product look purple Theyre not purple At least the ones I was sent They were charcoalI bought them specifically to use with my daughters purple Washburn guitar so its kind of annoyingOther than the color theres nothing wrong with them Not purple,neutral

The Product Itself Is Good Shined My Guitar Up Nicely The Cloth I Received Was A Black Microfiber Cloth With The Ernie Ball Logo I Must Say That The Cloth Is Very Nice Its Soft And Lint Free So The Cloth Alone Was Worth Purchasing This Polish After The Polish Is Gone I Will Probably Try Another Product I Need Something That Will Conceal The Fine Scratches On My Guitar Finish Probably Like A Guitar Wax But All In All This Product Seems Good For Wiping Down The Guitar After Playing Keeps The Instrument Nice And Shiny It Removes Smudges And Fingerprints Quite Nicely Not A Bad Product It Arrived Within A Couple Of Days I Am Satisfied With This Purchase Shines Up Nice,positive
Ive played this pedal for a while now and really dig it Im old school Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles this pedal has a great warm organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot You can barely bring it in for some warmth or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effectIll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B3 type of organ sound Great pedal,positive
I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars Somehow I had gravitated over to Martin PB about a year ago when I acquired a new Martin Surprise I got a set of these strings through the Vine program and chose to try them out on a Gibson Songwriter Studio Deluxe CE RATHER than on a Taylor or Martin The result is outstanding So much so that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acousticelectric guitars with Elixers againThey are even smoother and easier to play that I remembered them Of course these new strings have improved the technology which becomes more and more important to me as my fingers age right along with the rest of my body The sound is sweet and warm and the Gibson has never sounded better played pluggedin or unpluggedElixer definitely still has the edge Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments Great On A Gibson Too,positive
I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss The back rest support is nice too For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country Gigging guitarist quality seat,positive
SUMMARYAt 20 it is a great size and ok quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig Other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside No padding or impact resistance is provided but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle Also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different modelsPROS Good size for speaker stands mic stands guitar stands music stands other than the top shelf and other whatnot you may want to cram in there depending on your style affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingCONS This model is one compartment For speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model Lack of any impact resistance the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas It would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music standsDETAILSIn one of my 50 bags I was able to put 4 folding mic stands 1 music stand other than the top piece with the shelf that does not fit even if the bag was empty 2 folding guitar stands and still had room for some more if I wanted to put more in bag was getting kind of heavy at that pointIn a sconed 50 I was able to put On Stage Stands OSS SS7761B Speaker Stands They fit with extra room on the ends in this 50 bag There is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands I am considering exchanging this one for a 2 section 50 bag so the speaker stands are separated but probably will just keep this oneThe bag has no padding at all it is just canvas and a zipper and handles When laying empty it is 50 long x about 12 wide and lays flat Seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it aroundBut for 20 serves a basic purpose with affordability Good bag for the price heres what it holds,positive
Okay so its small easy to dial in a good sound very inexpensive made here in the US and has a wonderful transparency to itAdd to that the different ways to configure it by using the internal dip switches and you have a compressor as flexible as any Ive used for guitar at half or less of many cost which sound imho no betterIt stacks well with the EP booster and another compboost in the chain tooWhether you want to drive your amp a little harder or just squash your signal this product is impossible to beatI totally adore it IMPOSSIBLE to beat,positive
A friend of mine who is a guitar repair genus and budding luthier recommended this capo when I mentioned intonation problems with my guitarI had always had some issues with it but it was liveable The real problem began when I switched to different strings silk and steels I LOVED the tone I was now getting but the intonation problems were suddenly much worseWhat I had not considered until my friend mentioned it is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth I was looking for they are also easier to bend out of tune Duh I should have thought about this it makes perfect sense in retrospect The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings and greatly exacerbated the existing issue one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repairedSo he mentioned this capo and I immediately chortled 50 bucks Thats how much he payed YikesThen he grabbed his G7 from the car and let me try it The strings stayed in tune Thats 350 on repair I can pocket for other things at least for the time being I was so impressedI ordered one the next dayI am sure I will miss not being able to stick it on the usual perch when I am playing live but it is really easy to use in general and I wont look back The intonation issues are greatly reduced and I am thrilledWorth every penny Better than I had hoped,positive
This partial capo from Kyser has the same design construction and ease of use as Kysers topranked and bestselling 6string cano It is definitely recommended If you choose to go down he partial capo path though its best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams manual on the partial capo since its use is not intuitively obvious Same quality as the bestselling Kyser full capo,positive
This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians but for Amateur musicians like me If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play then youre fooling yourself You have to listen to your mix by recording it then listening while youre not playingsinging Amateur Musicians Record your mix,positive
Nice picks A bit small for my preference Great for picking kind of harsh for strumming Quality seems topnotch Some guitarists will love these Nice Picks,positive
I am editing my earlier review I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago One works just fine no problems whatsoever I use it on every gig and at home The other has some kind of short in it It drains batteries almost overnight When I take the batteries out no problem Tunes just fine but I am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of testI contacted Snark and Marcy their customer service rep sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty Excellent customer service They have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service isI will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly Snark is a great company,positive
works great Havent had a problem until now Very durable and not uncomfortable either Really awesome item for any type of electric guitar Awesome item,positive
decent holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles the bags shape from side view is a rectangle compare to other stand bags thats more of a square Zipper seems to be very good quality the bag is NOT padded at all and the material used is very thin there is however a water resistant coating on the interior of the bagI think I should have spend 10 extra and got the onstage padded stand bag But if you are going for local shows and doesnt need the extra padding for air travel this is the bag to go great,positive
I didnt want to spend too much for a guitar that I wasnt sure if I would like it or not There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price They were good quality and if this didnt work out then I would have probably gone that route To my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar The local shop only charged me 5 to shave them down I replaced the strings right away Im completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it Definitely worth the price you pay Love it,positive
its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting Squire fender guitar in terms of EtoE string spacing The Low E string out of range and not fit in the hole by mistake i ordered it for Squire M80 elec guitar,positive
I had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified then it worked like a charm Glad I got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig Work Great,positive
For the price you can not beat these They work great and after a year with them they are still working like the day I got them This is a great buy Good Unit,positive
Cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far Ive taken them from new jersey to south carolina Cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems,positive
I was looking for a 25 TRS cable for my band room I wanted a quality cable with reasonalbe durability although I was willing to compromise some durability for cost and I feel this was an excellent choice Yes there are better cables available at a much higher price but I feel this is a well built cable and great value Quality meets my expectations and value is great,positive
Why not For the price and some reviews I found online I had to try this pedal I bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since Ive bought it NOTE I recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and Ive found that it does two things 1 The vibe sound doesnt get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2 any volume drop you might experience having this after some oddistortion seems to be less I suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you For me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz Do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this Mine is musicman587this is the pedal AFTER pedals but youll get a good idea of the general settings I use it on Amazing pedal for the money Try it,positive
This Is one great piece The quality of the guitar is Amazing and for Its price Outstanding It plays Beautifully with my 100w amp And with my experience of guitars this is a go getter otherwise I would see this one stand out to a 300 Les Paul AMAZING,positive
There are many cheapie string winders out there they all look pretty much the samebut they most certainly are not This one built like a tank with thick solid construction Its built for the long haul It fits every tuning peg its ever been fit to has a cool little compartment built in thats perfect for extra acoustic bridge pins and extra pics and simply is tough as nails This is the last one you will ever need to buy The best,positive
It does what it says It a Kyser Quick Change capo This capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry Highly recommended Great capo for quick changes,positive
Theres NO SUCH THING as a best string From experimenting over the years Ive found that while I have old standbys that will be the first thing I try often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitarCoated strings have become all the rage over the last few years Theyre expensive but they last a lot longer especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly Also they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the stringsElixir Polywebs were the first coated string The coating is much heavier than that of other strings This produces a much less bright more muted sound I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I cant stand it with standard strings The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfectIf youre looking for a darker sound then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings then you definitely dont want PolywebsThe 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound If you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star It depends,positive
I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived Just to find out it WASNT WORKING it is defective and because i brought it to Mexico now i cant get a refund or a replacementI will try to fix it through some local electrician or something Very dissapointing It was defective Doesnt work when first trying it,negative
A light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar Good material good zippers good design There are much more well padded soft and hard cases available but they take up a lot more room around the house when not in use I like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome For travel you would need better but for most uses this is a good choice Good basic protection,positive
Some of the stands I have purchased are hollow some are solid at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand The hollow ones are a PITA because they are easier to strip and bend All mic stand inventories I have bought from budget lines have this issue I wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box Hollow stand connectors are weak,neutral
Works as advertised Eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned A little tight It needs some force to put it into place Not sure if theres no standard among guitar makers on the size of the sound hole and Planet Waves just did their best guess on a universal fit product But on my Washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there It works,positive
Sometime round 1994 my friend Kendal built several of these for our band They were great and incredibly handy I havent investigated this but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not Certainly if he did he never patented it or anythingAnyway flash forward 18 years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes resenting batteries and individual power supplies I thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one againand so i did This one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters So far it has lived up to my expectations I cat speak to playing out with this yet as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose So for such a simple device you really cant beat itunless you dont really use boxes Personally i presently have my wah distortion chorus overdrive delay slap echo and flanger running through it Everything works greatEnjoy A very handy device for anybody using multiple 9v stompboxes,positive
I love these customsinbetween the lights and mediumsyou get the bright booming soundnice bends and of course the longer playing lifeIve used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in themto brigthen the sound a tad I would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye Fantastic,positive
Definitely provided extra gripping surface The pick extends out from the rubber shell Obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer Since you have the shell they are a bit thicker than a normal pick which may have to be gotten used to I know for me I prefer to grip the pick really close to the tips for harmonics and on these your fingers definitely dont slip but its a bit more pic than I want So I do carry and use these occasionally but they arent my everyday pick Good pick to have in your aresonal,positive
I love the fit and the sound quality It doesnt come loose or wiggle once in place Ill get this one again Good sound tight fit,positive
I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX it comes with 100 set effects I have been doing home recording with Cubase and Logic using a Presonus Firebox audio interface with both MIDI vocals and instruments and didnt use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b I had more inputs and outputs than the Firebox could easily handleThis mixing board didnt look that impressive to me when I first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly The fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus The fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus But basically it works well the EQ is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer Behringer makes a range of models with lessmore inputs to suit ones needs so this is great Also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as I can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what I want to record Another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero And there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything Well I would have liked some of these things but then I would have to pay more and what I really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the Behringer Xenyx has delivered thus farBy the way I am running the following through the mixer an AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic an Alesis QS81 guitar via linein or micd two KRK RP5 studio monitors Presonus Firebox Everythings been working and sounding great thus farThe effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me since I am running Logic but if I ever use it live which I may do Id imagine theyd come in handy The effects are just soso in terms of sounds usable but not that great in my opinion Good little mixing board that could,positive
These are made solid and are very stable I knocked it to 4 stars because they dont match up The holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky Sturdy construction,positive
These are a good value for quality stringsStrings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling inIm very satisfied good strings affordable price,positive
Its the exact same thing as my 34Shure34 mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material thats fine by me They fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should its a knockoff but it works fine,positive
ive been using these tortex picks for a few years now and wont buy any others they feel great dont fall out of my hands and have a decent life span plus the turtle logo is sweet pick of the litter,positive
I bought this tuner because I am learning to play guitar and want to keep my guitar in tuneGreat little tuner that looks good and works even better It works really well but not perfectly I LOVE IT,positive
Its a great strap Its comfortable and you can wear it for hours It looks good as while I got it earlier then expected and I love it I would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro Strap,positive
Fender 1ASX2SJTXK 10Feet Performance Series Guitar Cable ig good Stereo cable for guitar or keybordIts long enought I recommend it Fender 1ASX2SJTXK 10Feet Performance Series Guitar Cable,positive
I like this cable for it has an angled plug It is not that long but no complaints It works as it should and does well Short Plug,positive
Great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument micGreat Price Very Happy and shipped from Amazon perfectly with great packing Perfect Weight for Bass Drum or on the Desk,positive
I was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphonesThey are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphonesBut the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music I say go for DrDre BeatsIf you want to know what the noise isolation feels like just putting your hands on your ear Overrated Trust me AthM50s,positive
I had never heard of ChromaCast but after buying this guitar bag its easy to understand why this bag is a top seller at Amazon Its relatively inexpensive fairly well built and features a number of zippered compartments of varying configurations to store accessories The case is very convenient to carry as it has a handle on the top and a second handle on the side It also has a set of shoulder straps for carrying the guitar on your back The quality of the nylon is decent enough and there is a rubber pad on the bottom for protection and traction The amount of padding inside the bag is a little light and the zippers might not be heavy duty but for general use this bag is hard to beat for valueSome have reported that the case is too small to accommodate an acoustic guitar but I was able to insert my 48 high acoustic inside with some room to spare I was so impressed by the quality of this bag that I also boughtChromaCasts electric guitar bag for just 17 lots of compartments in this very serviceable acoustic guitar bag,positive
These headphones get the job done I like the build and design Very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs Nice,positive
Sure its a few bucks more than the standard Crybaby but totally worth it Built like a tank but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings This Is Definitely The One To Get,positive
I have used many clipon guitar tuners They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on I have several of them and use them often on many guitars Based on this experience I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up gettingIt tunes nicely and so far as my ear is concerned accurately Others found it awkward to attach I did not It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read Those are not problems What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the deviceThis fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and more importantly in the toodelicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrumentThe fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp This clamp is made out of thin plastic is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time Consequently I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the otherIf the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will essentially live there it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clipon versions of Planet Waves tunersNovember 282011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now I have found that it has a good purpose While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted I have been surprised and pleasedto realize that they are wonderful permanent tuners for acoustic guitars They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible I leave them on my 12strings and one of the 6s A nonbuiltinbuiltin tuner at this price cannot be beat Based on this belated realization I have raised the product rating to 4stars Small but fragile and not so easily portable,positive
First off let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only 100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return homeI DID NOT expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitarI DID want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashedWhen I unboxed this guitar I was floored The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far The strings it came with werent complete crap but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings The guitar sings beautifully the tone is rich and vibrantIts quite comfortable to play I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away Im not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone E on it so I will probably end up removing it but the sunburst is really nice looking I have received many compliments on the look of it alreadyOVER ALL this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag GET ITAlso Im buying a hard case to take it home or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after Im gone Even if I do decide to leave it out here Ill be buying another one when I get home Absolutly an amazing guitar for 100,positive
I love this product It came fast included extra shockmount line shockmount an adapter the mic instructions and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preampuse mic cables not 14 cables for Phantom Power and I couldnt be happier with it It even looks impressive Although I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny when in reality it is this offsilver color Almost a gold but not quite Its not bad or anything just different And frankly the thing could be purple for all I care as long as it produces great sound thats all that matters Great product and extremely affordable No complaints Great Microphone,positive
There really is nothing not to like about this pedala 2 band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than mostb then drive goes from clean to solid overdrivec level control provide from ve to high ve boostWith drive set to 3pm and level at 2pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior really nice roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volumehighly recommended An outstanding overdrive,positive
The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling Maybe its just me but thats how they come across I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel but dont lose that new sound new as fast I didnt have near as much string stretch with these either Ill keep using them just maybe in a different gauge Nice,positive
id say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection i dont use them all too often because theyre a bit too stiff though neat,positive
Needed an XLR cable for a gig and ordered one of these the week beforeit got the job done my bass sounded great through the PA and the crowd loved the band Home run Gets the job done on the cheap,positive
i always keep these around during string changes i prefer the bass version to this if you can find it love these,positive
Ive had a Jam Man for some time which as a tech person Ive found incredibly difficult to figure out Perhaps I didnt take the timeANYWAYS this pedal on the other hand is a 100 leap forward in the opposite direction I didnt need instructions just punched in layed down a riff and jammed for about 2 hours straight I did this for two days in a row Its simple built well and and fun to use Cant recommend it enough It will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players Simple perfect looping,positive
It works and cleans the strings but its durability is a little low for about 2 months I recommend Planet Waves String Cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner Yes it works but not for too much time,neutral
I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one However it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included This bracket holds the NS micro tuner of which I have 3 I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications However now this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need A simple modification but bordering on genius The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screwspring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed Highly recommended Upgrade,positive
I bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well For only 1200 it is a steal the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy I have used it with multiple mics such as the Audio Technica 2020 with the Samson SP01 shockmount a Rode K2 a Studio Projects C1 and a neumann TLM 103 I have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic I was not going to write a review for this product but I came across another review that stated I purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a AT2020 with a SP01 shockmount Mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what I try THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE The Samson SP01 shockmount works perfectly with this stand as any shockmount or mic would since the threading is a standard size I just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion Also almost every shockmount has an adapter in the mount where the shockmount connects to the mic stand that is slightly smaller than most US mic stands BUT THIS COMES OUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A COIN AND UNSCREW IT FROM THE SHOCKMOUNT After the adapter is out the Samson SP01 will connect to this stand I highly recommend this product IT WORKS WITH THE SAMSON SP01 SHOCKMOUNT AT2020 AND ANY MIC,positive
This thing is awesome I hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget itIt has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar and one that restsin the case up by the headstockIve been playing for about 15 years and have always used a humidifier This works just as good as anything elseKeeps my case at a nice 6070 humidityI would recommend a nice Hygrometer to keep in the case too Just to make sure you have the proper humidity levelUPDATE 7172013So being the lazy guy that I am I never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hardWell I noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing waterThese really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifierThey are almost completely back to their normal state being very gellike feelingSo I am convinced that they work now Love It,positive
Unquestionably a topoftheline manual string winder but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitars headstock On some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy For now Ill stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb Very Well Made Winder,neutral
I put them on a Dipinto Mach V with that Levis Rat fink guitar strap I need to exchange I use this on all my guitars I tried some off brands and Ive found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal work great,positive
There too many required words to type for a product that doesnt need that much explanation It mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need sturdy Perfectly Adjustable,positive
Dont even hesitate buying this thing Its everything you need Its a pop filter It clamps on to anything that isnt over about an inch and a half in thicknessIt gets the job done Buy it Does the job properly,positive
these strings are different and really quite nice the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings I really like them only possible difficulty is that high E etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string I have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my Epiphone as well the standard Earnie Balls nice alternative string very easy to play,positive
legendary performance indeed works perfectly extremely easy to set up very good sound good price thats bout all you need to know very very satisfied,positive
the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more wide sweeping flange effect great harmonics and little power useage well worth the investment fab flanger,positive
PEOPLE YOU NEED TO BE STATING WHICH AMP AND SPEAKERS YOU USE OR YOUR REVIEW IS POINTLESSThat being said the reason is because every amp will cause the tube to react and sound differently Speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice Type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcomeAmp Vox ac30hw2Speakers Celestion Alnico Blue 8 ohmPower Tubes JJ EL84Pre Amp Tube Tungsol 12ax7 in V1 and the stock Ruby tubes in the other 2 spotsHow I Set My Amp Volume just before breakup and 12oclock with bass and treble knobs changes per guitar but stays closeGuitars Used Fender Telecaster Deluxe Chris Shiflett with stock pups Gretsch Silver Falcon 2010 with stock Filtertrons Gretsch Sparkle Jet Blue Pearl with stock Filtertrons Fender Jazzmaster 65 American Reissue with stock p90sI also purchased a JJ12ax7 to see how that sounded so will compare the ruby JJ and this Tongsol preamp tubesI found the Tongsol to give me the best tone over all Less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp It caused just enough high end roll off to give the warmth Ive been looking for to my ears I found the JJ12ax7 to be much clearer but slightly harsher in the high endmaybe more Fenderish I REALLY like the way the Tungsol makes my Jazzmaster sound Its heaven It gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highsMy findings could and probably will be different from yours because of your guitar cable quality pick attack and style of playing My best advise is BUY MANY different brands and TRY THEM ALL in your amp theyre not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones Most likely you will buy a different amp at some point so keep the tubes to maybe use in that one Comparison between my three 12ax7 tubes,positive
But its a real step up from the effects on my Vox Mini 5 amp so Im only going to complain too much It actually cost more than the behringer amp Im running it through which seems a little odd to me was expecting a little more,neutral
The reason I bought this pedal was for the 34Space34 setting which is essentially a shimmering organ octave up effect On the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking and it can get crowded with chords but it does sound ethereal and choiryFeaturesTime controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals decay controls the length of the reverberations tone controls the color of the reverb and mix controls the level of wet to dry it can basically cut all the dry signal if desiredThe trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off however if your mix is set to max wet signal no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off I havent really been able to use it effectively so I just leave trails offDual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrumentSoundsThe classic reverb sounds spring plate room chamber arent very distinct from one another The hall setting is bit more expansive the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note removing excess reverb for the latest noteschords played The cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delayConsThe blue led is VERY bright as on all Behringer pedals I just cover it up with a sticker and it still shows throughthe foot switch is digital so it doesnt preserve state and doesnt have the best assuring 34click34because it is buffered bypass the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it even when offthe battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch and then lift upAlso almost 50 of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate which can be removed but that makes the pedal almost toylike in weight Sweet pedal Comprehensive review,positive
Love Elixir strings I bought my first pack over 7 years ago and Ive been hooked They last at least twice as long as traditional copper wound strings and sound even better GET THESE These make my cheap 50 acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my Martinno kidding Great guitar strings,positive
Received these with lightining speed They came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up Alot of adjustments to these and they actually adjusted high enough for me at 65 to be able to sing at Lemmys angle Great for singing micing amps and such These are 3999 each at a local music store soUpdate These are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummers mic but if you grab it with some enthusiasm the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand I used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that I still say they are good for the price just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen Im yet to use them but the quality is there and received them fast,positive
The reverb broke in my amp and I tried the Boss FRV1 to replace it and didnt really like it too much Then I read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby This is exactly what I wanted It fills out the sound and yet doesnt add any artificial high end Sounds gorgeous for what I do which is playing alone in a basement For most songs its always on and it really excels at vintagysounding stuff like Rockabilly and Surf The mod button is a nice addon but I havent really bonded with it yetIf I had to buy this over again I might consider the Aqua Puss because I dont use the high delay times all that much and the Aqua Puss has an easy access battery door Great for reverbless amps,positive
Well made Enjoyable to play Stay in tune well The sound is clear and warm on my Yamaha and my Martin Right now I am experimenting with different strings so I cant say if they are better than others I personally like the sound better than the Martin ESs I have tried but that is a personal choice Let your guitar be the judge Clear and Warm Sound,positive
I have been playing guitar for three decades and It seems to me that DAddario has been aroundI use light strings when I want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar Light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner probably because I used them in this manner It is great that Amazon stocks these making ordering convenient These come in a stay fresh vacuum pack so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent Great set of strings with history,positive
We bought this tester for our son to use for his bands equipment setup It appears to be well constructed and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues Inexpensive Cable Tester,positive
I love this cable It is perfect for making guitar changes without noise The cable itself does not seem quite as good quality as my other Planet Waves cables but it is still better than most others The switch is easy to use Great idea,positive
I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one and I do not regret that decisionFirst of all it is a beauty Initially I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish My guitar was made in China which may account for the darker hue I thought I had wanted a lighter color but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have Second this instrument is no lightweight either in heft or playability It is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit thats basically the only adjustment Ive made or likely will makeIts been barely a day since the guitar arrived and as yet Ive only played it unplugged I cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up Beautiful and perfectly made,positive
You can never go wrong with Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating 6StringThe great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating 6String,positive
The concept of this guitar stand is great and I thought it would be perfect for my two TelecastersThat is until I get the stands in place and put the guitars in them The stands have a very deep angle and from what I could tell the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees backIt just looks silly like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand or are in a slowmotion fall backwards It also ends up taking up WAY too much space as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes I ended up returning these stands but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version Guitar Leans Back Way Too Far Ends Up Taking Up Too Much Space,negative
I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9s and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiffIve also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or soIt almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as black as the oxidation Ive seen from lowquality stringsThey also seem to have more string squeak when changing chords than other brands even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that vintage tone but they do sound decentHowever for 6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings 009042or save some money and go withDAddario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings Super Light 942EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set 9 42seem to feel better to me but I am a DaDairyO man for now Decent strings but a bit stiff,neutral
This strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear The choice of colors and durable material are two strengths Price was good for a useful accessory Useful product with color options,positive
Could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box Plugged it into the Macbook Pro fired up GarageBand and right away its MIDI connectivity was intermittent Then it had some stuck notes Then it stopped being recognized at all It still got power from the USB bus but no MIDI no sound The jack was visibly wiggly tooSo youre mileage may vary but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron I returned it and bought an MAudio Oxygen 25 for 20 more defective,negative
This is great for keeping your pedal board more organized All you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in Great Product,positive
Im a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner everam 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43 That being said using the looper was an eye opener I bought it as a learning aide to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression The thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression I played Theres no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing Lets just say Im not as close to being a player as I thought and I would 34not34 figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper So it is an amazing critic for us beginners And if your like me and you experienced guitarist you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for Its an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins youll have the gist of it From what I understand its very basic compared to other loopers i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction Ive only given it Limited use,positive
First of all let me say from some of the pictures I have seen posted of this Pop Filter when put on a Yeti mic stand the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured This is a design flaw not with the Pop Filter but with the Yeti stand as this filter has been around long before the Yeti came out Blue or a clever do it yourself person could easily fix it by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount Then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand There are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well Since I have mine hanging upside down on a boom stand attached to a Blue Radius Shock mount this is not an issue for me but I will say it is a problem Blue should fix I have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix Other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems I am not going to knock any stars off because Im reviewing the filter itself which is superb and how it works for meNow for the meat This is a studio grade high quality product all metal except for the two tightening knobs The dual screen design eliminates any plosives Ps and Bs for example better than any screen I have used so far This is especially true when the screen distance is about an inch from the Yeti capsule screen and you are 4 to 6 inches away from the unit itself which I have found to be the Yetis sweet spot in the Cardioid pattern Next the silk screened Blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot if you place it in front of the capsule area I like the idea of a metal screen especially if you are transporting it you wont have to worry about snaggingor runs as you do with the cloth filters Speaking of old cloth filters I have a Neumann which is about 12 years old a very nice screen as well but it does not cut the pops as well as the Blue especially if you get closer to the mic and screen Also when reading copy or maybe music I can see over and through the Blue filter much better than the round 6 14 inch jobs Like the Neumann You can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily cheaper filters I have used in the past will creep back into unwanted positions the Blue behaves The Blue Pop is absolutely transparent no muffling as with foam filters The curved design of the Blue Filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all The screen is a solid build as are all of the Blue products I have used so far It also fits the look of the Yeti and Radius Shock Mount like a glove Surprisingly I paid a little over 3000 on Amazon a real bargain in my mind for such high quality This filter is for all the Blue Microphones by the way and I am going to use it on my entire collection of mics10711 AddendumIf you need to use the Yeti as a table top mic especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter any brand I would suggest buying aSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand which works great for this set up Yeti Another Great Product From Blue,positive
The device itself is difficult to read in bright lightMy first one arrived not working at allThe second one arrived with a low battery What After three days the battery goes outI would have returned it but lost it because it doesnt adhere to the headstock very well Youve been warned Not recommend in my opinion,negative
SummaryAcoustic sounds 34ok34 but noisy in weird ways I returned it Price seems high for what it is and vs alternatives in the marketplacePros Boss case is metal mechanical design is durable standard 9V power and the power jack is on the back where it belongs variety of acoustic sounds possible personally I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all thoughCons fizzy noise integrated with notes played or chords generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain While I have several Boss pedals I think they always make the knobs too small and the fontprint too small I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playingDetailsThe basic concept is good I had an AC2 prior model and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note It wasnt in between the notes or when not playing it was integrated with the sound of every note you played or chord and you could not filter it It was also just noisy in the pedal chain Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some However I sold that model because I didnt want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasnt happy with the sound At the time the AC2s were selling for about 85 new Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC3I bought the AC3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC2 and they did a little But not enough to keep it I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues just not as pronounced I think the AC3 could work for gigging but there are other choices that sound as good for 25 instead of 130 to 150 with tax andor shipping so to me the boss pedal is overpriced and not that greatI opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead They make two a 3430034 and a 3440034 The 400 has reverb on the pedal I opted for the 300 and got it for 25 I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case However this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Bossif it breaksIll just buy anotherI also have a Boss GT100 multieffects unit You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC3 The least cost effective of those choices is the AC3 and it has noise issues the other two dont haveIm not saying its a bad pedal Im just saying it wasnt the best choice for me when considering the cost the sounds and my usage model If they would fix the noise issues I might have even kept it I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times Im using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect This Boss pedal just didnt work that well for me Bought it returned it Still has noise issue similar to prior model AC2 Also overpriced vs competition,negative
Ive been able to purchase 5 of these in different sizes for all my pickin pals Lightweight easy to transport in the back of your amp or just put it in a bag with your music THESE are good values for the money and do not fall over easily Those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work I mean really work well too Not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise They are the BOMB whee GREAT PRODUCT,positive
Nice features on a pedal this cheap I like the capacity to independently control treble and bass Switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal Not the bulletproof construction of a Boss pedal but I have quite a few Behringer pedals and Ive yet to have a malfunction in more than a year I have an EH Big Muff and this pedal is closer to that than to a Dunlop Fuzz face For this price its another great tool for your arsenal One thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass if you string a bunch of them together you are going to experience the dreaded tone suck If most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass you will be fine Good Fuzz for the,positive
I bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and Im satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second too many instruments for my own goodStill it could use some tweaks Id recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight especially on carpet where theres even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress It also protects against overtightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support barsI can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldnt take much to tilt over forwards but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies especially electrics counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support making a forward fall unlikelyStill for sanitys sake Id position the stand close to a wall At first this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand But its easy to rig up one or two 68 inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulationcovered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks Removing any worry of a fall is worth the effortThe design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes the trick is to find the optimum balance point but its not hard I fit an acoustic bass guitar a 335shaped Ibanez Artist Strat SGshaped bass JBass a Martin OM1 a long neck bouzouki sixstring banjo and a Nick Lucasshaped Recording King acoustic on it That said I dont max out the seven slots Ill use at most 5 simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when theyre that close If I were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes I might be comfortable with six or even sevenI wouldnt use this stand on stage and by on stage I mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it including a house party basement jam session etc Its simply not sturdy enough physics or no But for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where its tight to begin with Gotta Trust The Physics,positive
This thing sounds great with my tube amps both with my 2 watt danelectro amp from 1962 with its 8 inch speaker and my 12 watt excelsior from fender It has a good range of overdrive levels It is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lofi stuff like The Black Keys The White Stripes and garage band like stuff It is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz I love mine for the price and its a good mix up compared to my modded SD1 and my overdriven tube amps Its different and just worth having to mess around with Just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last Also the blue LED is very bright Thats either an annoyance or great Rock on A tiny tiny bit dull without darker or brighter tone settings but very cool and retro sounding,positive
Theyre 2 days on and sound fantastic already Ive come to expect nothing but excellence from Elixirs theyre the best Ive played on to date whether electric or acoustic I very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box Great tone,positive

I use this everyday It has prolonged the life of my equipment and improved the quality of my vocal productions Everyday use,positive
These are the Gold standard for all Strat type electrics Fender or not I put these 150s on all of my Strats regardless of the brand They are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great I tend to play my Strats a bit rougher than my Gibsons or acoustics so these are well tested in my house I get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit I will continue using these on all of my Strats until I find something better which I havent yet I do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as wellThese are bullet proof They take a pounding and last as long as you could expect A must have for all Strat type electrics,positive
I love these hanging Hercules Guitar Hangers The work wonderfully When you place your guitar into the hanger little supports turn in to each other creating a safe secure hanger Works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course There is no other way to hang a guitar,positive
This is my first guitar stand and I have to say I am pretty happy with it Its made of good quality metal and you can tell its much higher quality than the price tells it to be The neck strap and the base are excellent Made of great padding to pad the bottom and can put any guitar base on there Look at the other reviews and you wont be disappointed It didnt smell like the other reviews said either Very good guitar stand,positive

people say its an ocd clone it sounds very similar i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges but its a very subtle thing all in all im happy with it knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones good pedal to add OCD clone,positive
I used to have bulk 18 gauge wire and Switchcraft jacks to make my own cables These Hosa cables probably use 22 to 24 gauge wire but are adequate for the price The heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well I recommend tightening the housing because everyone of mine were loose Good Enough,positive
If youve seen the youtube videos then you know what this can doI especially appreciate that it has the two modes one for regular sustain and one for a feedback sustainThey can be switched back and forth even while youre sustaining a noteI cant wait to use this with my band well have to cover With or Without You for sure now Powerful tool takes a little practice,positive
well what can I say it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at HP level genius I bought it for my church since were going the HP monitoring route and this was my best bet against the super over priced shuresenheiseraudio technica overpriced systems I paired this up with the MA400 and it works great hook up an xlr straight from the DI and voila you got both inputs with separate control like I said genius does what its supposed to,positive
I bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall Comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly Couldnt be happier with this product Nice and easy,positive
This is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal It increases the gain and dirties your tone but it does not actually distort your soundIf youre a metal or hard rock player dont buy this Its better suited for country soul RB blues or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when theyre doing a solo For that its excellent especially considering its very low priceAnd despite its very low price its very solidly built Its like a brickThis update is to point out that Ive only used the Bad Monkey pedal with tube amps A Fender Blues DeVille 4x10 and a Line 6 Spider Valve HD100 MK II running into an Ampeg 4x12 I have no idea how itll sound with a solid state amp But it sounds great with a tube ampThis update is to point out that I finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good I recently bought a 100 watt Fender Mustang III combo to use as a practice amp It perfectly compliments my Fender Blues DeVille 410Fender Mustang floorboard combination As Ive said I use the Bad Monkey as a boost for soloing Whether Im playing clean or dirty the Bad Monkey gives my guitar a richdeepgreat sounding boostThis update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is I rarely play directly through any of my amps eg Fender Hot Rod Deluxe Blues Deville Super Champ x2 or Ampeg B25 Ill turn down the gain on the Bad Monkey and use it for a much fatter clean sound Its just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph Youve got to get this pedal Great for country and blues,positive
The Rat has been used by everyone from David Gilmour to Dave Grohl to give you a grasp of its range It does everything from light crunch to Marshallstyle thick rhythms to all out facemelting distortionRich harmonics near infinite sustain and a midrange push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedalThis pedal has not left my board since the day I bought it The fact that its built like a tank ensures its going to be around a long time after my playing days are over Incredibly versatile pedal,positive
My favorite strings for 30 years Have used DAddario strings since the late 70s Always a great sound at a great price Great strings,positive
This is not a toy Its a well crafted instrument Material is wood Decent quality Plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it Good refinements Rings around the hole and stripe on the back Strings had some oxidation Understandable as it was made and shipped from Indonesia Metal strings So thats a consideration if youre a beginner Sounds good too I prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway So if youre a beginner or an intermediate player who just needs a nice instrument hanging around home for an occasional strum this is it It is a pleasant addition to my home guitars Its for my wife who is learning guitar She loves it And it costs 10 of what mine costs and I dont mind playing it at all The only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming I dont even have that Its a feel good guitar Highly recommended for the occasional strummer Nice guitar,positive
OkI bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was OVERKILL I mean I had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment I gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration distortion and a flanger and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some accent to a determinate part of a songIts a cool pedal but I will recommend it for simple pedal configurations It will bring the extra juice you needCheers Does the job,positive
I needed a small capo for my mandolin and so I purchased this little guy Works great though I have to put it on at that 1st fret and then move it up to where I need it Does the job,positive

This Hosa Cable is very well made with good quality connectors and a nice long length My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected This 25 cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled aroundThe cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cableHighly RecommendedCFH Great Guitar Cable Good Value Highly Recommended,positive
You know any time a company actually sticks a battery in the box with their product it just puts a smile on my face Planet Waves has not only made a great small easy to install and easy to use tuner they included the battery Thats an A in my bookIve got a 12string acoustic guitar Pretty much every time I go to sit down and play I would waste a good 5 minutes grabbing my old tuner balancing it on my knee and trying to tune up With this head stock tuner sitting on the guitar I just turn it on and quickly get in tune and down to the serious business of jamming It truly makes the task many times easier The display is easy to read Its read when the string is way off and green when youre close using lines on either side of the keyletter to indicate sharp or flat or right smack dab in tuneIf I had the money Id stick one of these on all my guitars As it is having it on my 12string is going to save me hassle and time This baby is worth every penny and I highly recommend it to any guitarist Love it Battery included,positive
Reviews described strap as 34soft34 and 34weathered34 which sounded good to me Actual description is a blasted 34design34 which is what you get Strap is quite stiff but Id say its worth the price I would have preferred something different Ok but but I should have read description better,neutral

When I first got them I thought that they were going to be cheap as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging but it was ok I wasnt expecting much from them The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material They did not bend at all when I tried to and believe me I tried Pick wearing is virtually nonexistent and I utilize AltPicking a lot in my practices I actually learned my first sweep shred D major with these picks within a day of getting themI highly recommend for the shred guitaristMy only complaint is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do becuase of the grip but i got used to it rather quicklyIMPORTANTYou can get these in 24 packs at for only 10 Free shipping as wellSorry Amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on Amazing Picks,positive
yes you can tweak it so its less but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable massive amounts of hiss,negative

I JUST BOUGHT A NEW GUITAR AND WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE OF THESE THE PRICE IS GREAT AND IT WORKS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STAND AWESOME,positive
Really wanted to like this one because I loved the price There is no way this is true bypass The one I got was defective out of the box and so when I checked I saw the circuitry did not support pass through Maybe it is because I received a defective one but I still wouldnt try this brand name I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something Not true bypass colors tonebreaks easily,negative
Not only are these great picks to look at they are great picks to use I love the picks the tin they come in and the ease of use The Beatles,positive
I sent this to my grown daughter for her birthday and she has been very pleased with the product I have three tuners myself and I find the Korg to be portable easy to use and easy to read Battery life appears to be adequate Oh and not to forgetaccurate Shipping was faster than advertised A thumbs up for this one Amazon comes through again on price and product Korg is king,positive
Purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner This is a great tuner IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR With that being said this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say If that is what you are looking for an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate This little guy is best suited to practice if you are like me and dont use your primary rig for at home practice and dont feel like breaking out the old pedal chain it does the job and does it well Now could you use it for a gig Sure I suppose so but bear in mind that it is not an inline tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off For the price it cant be beat It swivels although not much but enough that you can clip it on read the nicely lit LCD and tune up quickly Great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar Fender Clip On,positive
I love this tuner I have other similar models and they are all greatdont hesitate to get oneThese are three times as high at guitar center how ridiculousok this may sound silly but just to let you know you can do itif you hold a stick or something similar touching your throat and clip this tuner to it you can tune your voice with iteven holding your thumb against your voicebox and clip this on your finger will do itcracks me up but fun to play with awesome tuner,positive
Its a button Its not fancy its silver it screwed into my ukulele with no problem and it works very well Button,positive
Elixir is my favorite brand of strings I bought these seeking strings with longer life after a bad experience w DAddario strings only lasted a week or 2 and boy ill tell you these babies LAST i only change these strings twice a year the coating makes it more comfortable easier to slide on the strings I love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune they also keep in tune good overall these string are a must try for EVERY guitarist I LOVE these strings,positive

I got these after using Dunlop Standard Tortex Picks 12 Pack Purple 114mm for some timei would choose the Jazz III are better for ME personally because i used to hold my picks wrongDue to the smaller size of the Jazz III im forced to be a better picker and player Comparison to the Dunlop Tortex Picks,positive
These plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for If I buy more in the future I will be checking here first Nice Product,positive
This works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three Havent run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet But judging by its performance on the bottom three and its fierce grip itll do just fine A really good capo,positive
I got this to use on an old Mac computer to allow me to use some equipment that needed more than a line level output It works great for that Havent used it for anything else though so cant comment there Seems sturdy and well made as well Worked for its intended purpose,positive
Every time I have ever used a desk mike Ive always had to lean into it because the stand was too short This little stand adjusts about six inches so its possible to get the mike right at mouth level without bending over Solves A Common Problem,positive
It does take a little getting used to the programming aspect but this little pedal is amazing I must have 20 different pedals and Im always torn which ones ones to bring to practice With this pedal its easyjust grab and go Are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals Probably not But they do the job just fine The thing I love the most and this may be a little anal but Ive actually preset individual settings for each song I play with my band That way I can shuffle through the presets with one stomp Some have two pedal effects some have 6 If this broke or wore out for whatever reason I would go right out and buy another one for sure Best 100 Ive spent on gear Spend some time and youll love it,positive
I am not a studio engineer nor am I a professional musician I record songs in my home as a hobby I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting so if youre at or around the same level you know what Im talking about Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much No Are you likely to find it in a highend professional studio Ehprobably not Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point Hells yesIve worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious and this is the nicest mic I own right now The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious I use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals SM57 and 58 this was still the case But with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and openAdmittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then arent all mic evaluations subjective You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application And to my ears this mic sounds wonderfulMy only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesnt seem to be a supertight cardioid because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it Perhaps this is how its supposed to be but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously it can be a headache trying to juryrig an isolation method that works I took off a star for this alone although that may not be fair since I havent used any other largediaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if theyre all supposed to behave this way Awesome hobbyist mic,positive
Great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while I8217m not sure why a few people are putting these strings down I8217ve used them numerous times without any issues They last as long and sound as good as any other brands I8217ve played Great strings,positive
Easy to pack easy on the instrument light weight but sturdy An excellent value and a great gift idea too Amazing value,positive
Its survived my clumsiness and I can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat Good sturdy stand,positive
If youve read my review of the much cheaper Hohner Old Standby Harmonica Key of C you know that I love the Special 20 Its great for beginners or experts alike Sounds great right out of the box and plays well I was able to bend notes right away with this one while other cheaper harps take a long time or never to break in properly All the notesreeds sounded good If youre serious about playing you will be very happy to have this harmonica around Ive had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite Worth the money it sounds great,positive
I purchased this for use with a Sennheiser E825S microphone and the bestselling On Stage boom microphone stand The mount has exceeded my expectations The fit for the stand is perfect with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down The part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out A screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place All in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase An excellent and inexpensive mount,positive
I have the Fender Mustang IV and I would say the fender is a superior modeling amp but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get The bass sounds great and when I played Here Comes the Sun on my acoustic Id swear the tone sounded like the Beatles record The modeling sound is ok and they tell me theres a looper here but id have to pay an extra 120 for a pedal to access it Oops there goes a star for the con job Peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less Ill wait and pick up a pedal used in the future Versatility rates this over some other modeling amps,positive
It can be confusing during the first time i used it But it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum Very handy and gets the job done quickly click and tune,positive
I got this amp recently at a local store and so far im loving it i also aqcuired the MKII Foot Controller and is a perfect combination Tons of sounds and it can be 100 edited to fit your demands Nice volume coming out of it also for 75 watts it seems moreRecommended Great Product,positive
Love this pedal The Mod button just makes it sound like tremolo to me and I have great classic Fender tremolo on the amp I use so I dont use that option much I just use it for when I want a little slapback and it works great for that and provides a real nice analog tone Great Basic Delay with Warm Analog Tone,positive
Easy to play Decent quality Not expensive Easy to bend Plastic comb with no recessThis is the lowest level youd want to really play the harmonica and it wont break the bank Best bang for the Buck,positive
When I made a larger pedal board from plywood to accommodate a new pedal tuner I could not pull the powergrip tape from the old board to reuse it The adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong Works great Very useful for a homemade pedal board,positive
Those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars Great Idea,positive
hands down my absolute favorite pick I have tried many brands materials various thicknesses but I always come home to the Dunlop Tortext Red 50mm Great Pick,positive
nice bag padding it good i just wish the hooks werent plastic not shore how long they will last fender electric bag,positive
this strings are just for starters because they feel really light but sound too weird so if u want to buy a really good for pro please but martin not really good sounding,positive
Very good tray to put small items I put my KVM switch on it and other server components I recommend it Nice small tray,positive
I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect I hit the strings very very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I dont break many strings Just right for rocking hard but not breaking strings,positive
I have a Martin D35 acoustic and strapping it with the string knot around the neck is honestly a bit annoying to do so i figure whats a 10 investment going to do for memake things easier and CLEANER LOOKING thats whati like it because it really just makes puting the strap on the guitar that much easier and removing it again an easy taskI bought the martin strap to match the colorMartin 18AMS2 Martin Leather Guitar Strap Brownjust being a martin brand nut i suppose One Word My Guitar Friends CONVENIENCE,positive
Basic delay I found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal The other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically Made my tone thin and tinny Not much to say here,neutral
I BOUGHT BOTH THIS STAMP FOR GUITAR AND ALSO ONE FROM THE SAME COMPANY FOR MANDOLIN UKULELE BANJO IM PLEASED WITH BOTH STAMPS LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE USEFUL TO STAMP CHORDS ON MY OWN MUSIC SHEETS AND OTHER MUSIC THAT DOS NOT HAVE GUITAR CHORDS SHOWN GUITAR STAMP REVIEW,positive
This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked What can you expect for 20 tho This was a temporary solution I dont recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart Dont wast your money,negative
Cheap Accurate over mic even better over jack Slot for your pick or coin is a joke and so far hasnt fit a pick or coin i stuck in it but thats just a dumb gimmick Great pocket tuner Great tuner for my bass,positive
Sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars I have a ceramic and this steel slide Each has a unique sound The steel as expected has more of brighter twang When I change my strings I know that Ill get some differences in tonal quality but hey experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys Sweet,positive
Arrived fast had them up and running in minutes It was easy to adjust my EQ on my laptop to produce awesome listening music just beautiful clear nicely separated sound I wouldnt use these for high volume stuff the sound is almost delicate and very precise in its separation The classical musicians in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something Stunning really They are in fact exactly what they are advertised to be top notch small room project studio monitors I readjusted my EQ for the needed flat response for sound engineering and I was extremely pleased with the results The sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust as the flat studio mixing EQ sounded horrible at first as it should I have been in and out of studios for 30 years and I can say used appropriately these are excellent nearfield mixing monitors Take time to review the set up data from MAudio its good stuff and dont ask these little beauties to be everything just let them be what they were made to be and enjoy We ended up remixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via Cubase 7 and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by 30 Honest sound great for project studios,positive
I have restored an old REX Commander Yeah I know never heard of it Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing But the resonance of the DAddarios really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side and bell like clarity on the treble side Not to mention how great they look The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me Terrific strings for the price of cheapies Full bodied mellow resonance,positive
I am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar and it seems to work fine no complains Tuner,positive
Ive got several capos from the highest end models to the cheapest and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones with ease of use and solid build quality Why spend more Just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more Does what its supposed to do but for less cash,positive
I was really interested in the M3 and checked with the Fender forum and I found that there is a problem with the M3 You can go to the Fender forum and read about it under the Mustang amp sectionTo make the long story short somenot all M3 M4 M5s have what is decribed as a fizz on the clean setting when hitting the low e string Sometimes its noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible Some people think its the power supply but nobody knows for sure Apparently Fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a fizz problem There is also a sample sound clip there on this fizzLike I said I just want people to know about this before buying a M3 Now I am considering the M2 which also has the fizz problem but with the the software fix released from Fender there is no fizz in the M2 I dont know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because I didnt get the M3 but if I bought it I would give it a rating of 3 stars because I dont like this fizz on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me If it didnt have this fizz I would give it a 5 star rating fizzing distortion sound with the Mustang 3,neutral
I purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the TUSQ I did have to sand to make it fit That may sound badm but I am glad because its better than too small I did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering Better than plastic,positive
Oh its a crybaby I have a crybaby wah You suck because you dont own a crybabyIm tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldnt even tell you how many strings their instrument has This wah pedal just doesnt cut it Maybe at one time but not today it hasnt been up to par in a LONG time As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal My mom bought me this one I thought it was awesome until I learned better It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke itThe eq on this pedal isnt good there is no smooth transition from heel to toe There is a big drop in the freq that kills the effect You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board I cant say its just a complete piece of junk it does give you a wah effect it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue I still had to slam on it to turn it onoff and it still sounded like a cheap wahMy suggestion The Mark Tremonti wah is great Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use It may cost more but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor You may say that this is a cheap processor and it is but Ive been using it for years and I havent seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on I have mine set fairly light and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily You even have presets crybaby being one of them You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit moreIf you want a cheap childs gimictype toy this is for you Want to get serious about a wah Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere serious musicians look elsewhere,neutral
I use these and the next heavier and have since they came out and the standard model before that Great grip slow wearing and they dont break Ive been playing since 1973 and switched to Dunlops way way back and have never found another I prefered So give them a try My Favorite Pick,positive
As an amateur musician Im always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such I thought this gadget would do the trick but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didnt meet my expectations Disappointed,negative
not your fender quality strap this is a cheap extremely low quality strap Ive had it for a few months and my guitar has not fallen yet but I can see the wear on the end its almost at breaking point I would not recommend it Its ok as an emergency strap or to get you out of a jam nothing else Fender name lacking fender quality,neutral
They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that dont know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex junk,negative
Not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand Solid heavy base Well built Does the job of holding a mic No more no less Does the job,positive
Well made Works as it should However seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800 more than the usual expectedTo see if it was the Mic cable or adapter Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorderSeems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR inputNo big surprises Minor clean up in post Good construction,positive
I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic It works great I would definitely buy this again The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end Substantial amount,positive
Worth every penny Great sound and stays in tune Will definitely make any uke sound great I replaced the stock strings on a MAKALA DOLPHIN with these and it sounds like a more expensive uke They are easier on the fingers and stay in tune much better than the cheap strings that came with the uke Definitely would recommend these Fantastic,positive
These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are They are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful My only concern is that if the strings arent wound properly they seem brittle and break eg Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G stringThe LIGHT version I find are particularly suited to finger picking Bright light and warmyou couldnt ask for more,positive
This Mighty Bright is great It clips to my music stand has battery power or ac adapter included and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare If you need a light for reading music or for just reading this is it No Brainer,positive
I usually stickup to the OverDrive pedals asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives Still I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall soundlike roar JCM800 and this guy did the job Its not a Riot but pretty much defends its self from the old 7080s songs Love it What a great sound,positive
Sounds pretty good Great for the price New to guitars but in 24hrs it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings Not bad at all,positive
I have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it Boy was i surprised this case is awesome great quality fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great Definetly reccomend this case awesome case,positive
This strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed I have these straps on all my gear very well made will last a lifetime Good Leather Strap,positive
Very Well finished everything except rubber is made of aluminum with little bit of metal i guessnot like other reviewer said it fits in your hand comfortable does not need lot of strength to openit may be hard for old man or kidalso rubber doesnt smell that bad i mean it does but its not seriousthey also used glue to stick rubber Well made,positive
This is a wonderfual addition to help maintain the humidity for your guitar this product is recommended by Taylor guitars GREAT PRODUCT,positive
Bought stand as a gift for my sons acoustic guitar He loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand Cant go wrong for the price Guitar stand,positive
Nice little device Well see how long it lasts a cheap little plastic thing really but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue I use it with the medium dunlop picks Glad I got it Does the job so far,positive
I bought this pedal wanting classic distortion and find it more useful as an overdrive pedal The distortion range does not get as hot as a RAT or MXR classic distortion but it sounds great with a telecaster and tube amp I use it with a cigar box guitar also for fun and the tone ranges from 60s and 70s distortion to 80s metal I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an exampleI like that the pedal has a wide array of uses The build quality seems questionable from MXR As others have posted the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXRs espeacially the older ones but this pedal seems solid and makes no noiseThe price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it I have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way I would steer clear of this if you are looking for a pedal for metal and definately buy it if you are into classic rock twang and blues Classic distortion and overdrive blended together,positive
Arrived on schedule Sturdy with adequate padding to protect my 34babies34 Three zipper pockets to hold cords mics capos and tuners as still have room for keys and combs I own several gig bags and this is my favorite Great gig bag,positive
I recently changed them out for a different type of EBs while they were good the were not exactly what I was looking for not sure the new set is either but time will tell Decent set of strings,positive
This is a vey simple fix to a constant problem with guitar straps and where to connect the strap to your guitar It goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily It is a great idea and worth the cost I hate having to drill a hole in my guitars Perfect and no holes to be drilled in my guitar,positive
I love this boost pedal so much I owned the MXR Micro Amp for a while but I found that it colored my tone way too much too much low end The MC401 on the other hand doesnt color your tone at all It provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive The boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords If youre in the market for a boost or a buffer Id look no further This pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing Amazing Boost,positive
I like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily The biggest down side is the angle that the guitar sits the lean is to far back so youll need to keep it further from walls than usual Other wise good deal Nothing fancy does the job,positive
If was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood I have 2 70w 1234 amps and a big Fender DSP 212 I am using this for my 112 amps It works very well I recommend them to do the job for the I am not sure I would use them for a 1200 Sunn V4 4x12 cabinet solid equipment adjustments and good not great,positive
this is a great strap nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible Best part this strap gets long long long Yep here it is long and short,positive
I only use a few of them its good to find what style fits you Id recommend it for finding what suits you Good product,positive
I could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor reverb pedal harmonizer ring modulator etc The Line 6 M5 seemed like a good way to have a jackofalltrades pedal on my board for those times I needed one specialized effect I have to say that it serves that purpose in spadesI have an allanalog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers I was wrong to worry digital has come a long way Almost all of the effects sound great to my ear especially into a tube amp True bypass means no tone suck to bootHigh points for the delays reverbs and mods I am not a fan of all of the drives but the Overdrive and Boost Comp sound pretty awesome The Rat model Classic Distortion sounds exactly like my ProCo Rat2 Wish I could say the same for the Big Muff model but I guess they couldnt get them all rightThe only issue is I liked it so much I could not resist the urge to get the M9 so I can run three effects simultaneously However if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the M5 is a winner Fills that void in your pedalboard,positive
many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use install hangars They are reliable so far they do not hurt anything on your instrument I am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars violin How self adjusting can they be apparntly quite they are fantastic,positive
I bought this pedal after looking at the Boss TU3 and Korg Pitch Black for bass This pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode Strumming all 4 or 5 strings works well for a quick tune but I still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune The accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low BI read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out TC electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped IMO but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselvesI was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the ADG strings and it worked okayThe pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze I chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as I can I tested this sweep option on an old Ibanez artcore guitar which hasnt been played for years and even with old strings I got a reasonable tune out of itStrumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tuneI am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old Boss TU2 I feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze Good tuner for 4 and 5 string bass,positive
I purchased this guitar about a year ago and the things still kickin not planning on replacing it anytime soonOnce I got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel action was fine for me out of the boxMost definitely one of the best 34bangforyourbuck34 acoustic guitars Very nice guitar Great for a beginner,positive
Does its job Good solid construction Support cords seem to be of good quality Knob tightens well Comes with thread adapter Smooth silver satin finish Affordable price Nuff said Just buy one already Great build quality,positive
This cable Works fine im going to buy a pair in January 2013 I used it live and they are really great durable and it feels pro Try one Monster Cable Standard,positive
While Ive never been a big delay guy Ive always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect Im definitely not a fan of digital delay so I did a lot of RD on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for meThere are basically three options out there for delays under 200 MXR Carbon Copy EHX Memory Boy and Malekko Ekko 616 I realize that there are other pedals out there but according to my research these are the best three for the priceThe Memory Boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation something I was not interesting in Crazy effects are an EHX trademark so if youre looking for that sort of thing the Memory Boy might be up your alley I read nothing but good things about the Malekko Ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the Carbon Copy for a while and ultimately went with the Carbon Copy because I was able to find the most firsthand reviews of itI dont regret my decision this pedal sounds great The repeats are long and do not sound artificial Some people complain the repeats are too dark but I dont think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay If youre looking to recreate The Edge sound analog delay is not for youIm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track to slapstick to dreamy repeats on solos I love it Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my toneOne minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least outofthebox There are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but I have yet to mess with them I would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself Great analog delay,positive
I ordered the Hola and the Snark SN6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church Ive spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to 34settle in34 Ive used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent I cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one They are both contact tuners meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphoneThe Hola is definitely the best choice of the two in that its more versatile easier to use more durable looking and easier to store The Hola lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need The Snarks curved display arm which you cant really see in the photo is slightly more delicate looking in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther I found the Hola display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read Honestly most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are The really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the HolaHola offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function You can select 34chromatic34 34guitar34 34bass34 and 34ukulele34 modes by briefly pressing the power button as opposed to a longpress for power onoff This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician Imagine trying to tune with a an 88key piano if you dont know anything about the notes on the piano 34Ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes Use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instrumentsThe snark is superior in its rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction If turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the Snark I found the Holas display to be more than sufficient Im currently using the snark on my guitarThe Snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable cardboard box I have no problem with it but the Hola stores better I dont really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a 34ukulele34 setting Its a chromatic tuner It very well may be sized differently from their other models to fit better on ukuleles Other than that Im not quite sure what makes it specifically a 34Ukulele tuner34 This is a chromatic tuner no ukulele tuning mode,neutral
This mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar ampsSome people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone You should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg Great Stand,positive
I have used Fender Medium picks since the late 60s Yes they are made in China now but they are still the same pick as far as I can tell The picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini ziplock baggie All 12 were in there all of them Fender Mediums purchased from BG Music Associates Shipped from Illinois to California in 3 days with normal shippingThe picks are great and I couldnt be happier with the order Whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where I stand Recommended if you wantneed a nice little bag of Fender Mediums All 12 packed in mini ziplock,positive
I purchased a set of Fender Vintage Tremelo Tension Springs in order to beef up the tremelo tension on an inexpensive Squier Jagmaster guitar that I recently purchased These springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the Jagmaster the loop actually goes all the way around which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar and it seems that they are of a higher tension Highly recommended as replacement springs or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars Great Product,positive
If there are still people out there who dont believe in magic just try this It has truly elevated my playing a few notches Id probably have bought another bottle already but this one seems to be lasting forever Ive had it a few months now I use it pretty much a few times everyday and it still seems fullIf after using this your playing doesnt improve then maybe you should give up guitar Magic in a bottle,positive
Bought these to plug into practice bass amp wifey a little nasty when I get itch to play at 2 am I play 5 string and I could not believe the deep sound I get out of these especially in this price range Highly recommend SUPER GREAT AWESOME,positive
Will this replace a pro fret job NahThat said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smoothEnd results Great for a Quick Polish,positive
I finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner This thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it doesnt suck any of your tone I havent used the battery pack so dont know about battery life I use a onespot plug to power it Another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on Its very heavy and seems sturdy and well built The display is a little confusing at first but once I read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use Great truebypass tuner,positive
I thought I could take the smell I couldntOtherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad soundingThe case is nice too but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools sulfurI tried airing it out for a week with no successIf you have no sense of smell get one I thought I could take the smell,negative
Work perfectly with my guitar good price No problems with static crackling hum or other sound artifacts Great for amateur vocal recording like me Good cable,positive
I have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any I like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts Neat product,positive
Fit my 07 MIM strat perfectly Looks like a whole new guitar now If you have a Fender guitar then suck it up and buy only fender parts for it The Cheap china copies on ebay dont fit Just what I needed,positive
I love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing Best of all I can find them here for 349 per set so Im not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time Easy to play and they sound greatlong lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time Best Acoustic Strings,positive
After reading the reviews I expected the leather to be a tougher than it is Its soft without being limp Theres no breakin time required I bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great I like to keep a preadjusted strap in each guitar case and Im planning to buy another one of these for my Martin Great strap,positive
This was a great purchase My son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford He would definitely purchase from here again Snark SN1 Tuner,positive
These picks are nice and thin just what I was looking for in a pick They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down Im satisfied with these picks thin picks by Dunlop,positive
I have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks I just needed something I could plug into that was super portable and cheap Also this works well with an iPhone set up if you want to use some larger effects this little guy doesnt come with Also this little guy doesnt gobble up 9volt batteries like other guitar gear tends to do The only minor flaw is its made out of plastic so if you need something more durable maybe get a solid state amp the plugs into a wall outletour buy two more of these they are only 20 bucks Great product,positive
Cool pedal on a clean amp I ran it into my dual gain amp and it just muddied the sound up I am buying an old twin head that I want to try this on for a little vintage grit I think it will work great for that great pedal if you run it into a clean amp,positive
To my mind there are three criteria for evaluating a capo1 Its got to hold with enough even pressure to keep all the open stringsringing clearly especially in the face of hard picking strumming and string pulling2 The design shouldnt intrude on either my thumb when its behind the neck or peeking over the fingerboard or the side of my index finger when Im at the first fret playing chords or single notes3 The design shouldnt require excessive hand pressure or too much fussiness to apply reposition and remove the capo especially twohanded fussinessThe TriAction capo scored big on all three criteria It held tight on a variety of acoustic and electric neck widths and profiles from a Martin OM1 with a wide rounded shape to a Gibson L4 archtop with a baseball batthick and round neck a skinny SG a wide and soft Cprofiled Ibanez Artist and an imitation Strat with a hardradiused fingerboard and classic Cshaped neckPlanet Waves came up with a design that works both over and under I can squeeze the capo with my fingers with its back snug in my palm or flip it over and use the base of my thumb making it effortless to position adjust and removeThe capos profile is comparable in size to the Keyser but without the Keysers protruding high angle arm neccessary to generate adequate spring tension Ive used the Keyser for years and in my opinion the TriAction is far easier to applyThe TriAction is also much less conspicuous from the front although its not quite as compact as the Schubb or those fancy minimalist capos some flatpickers like I like them too but theyre a little more work than I sometimes wantWhats remarkable about the TriAction is its spring tension thats truly comfortable to apply yet produces a more than adequate string grip The spring wire is probably 116 thick and I cant imagine it ever losing its tension The adjusting screw wheel is about a quaterinch wide and textured for an easy touchThe purpose of the tension wheel is not to vary the distance between front and rear capo surfaces as is the case with some other brands but to vary the pressure exerted by the rear surface against the neck and consequently the amount of pressure required to squeeze the capo The bottom line is you can customfit the capo to your hand strength and avoid straining or worse a painful palm cramp like the one I got on stage once while squeezing the KeyserThe pick holder is also nicely designed a kind of serrated slit that lets you securely stash a pick at varying depths equating to how easy it is to pull it out I think my pockets serve the same purpose even more securely but its a nice touchI didnt think there was a whole lot of room left for reengineering the largely utilitarian guitar capo but clearly a lot of thought went into Planet Waves NS TriAction Capo enough to easily knock my previous goto capo right off its pedestalGet one and sit back and watch the banjo guys sweat when the fiddler calls for Done Gone in Bb at that next jam session Your Hand Muscles Will Thank You,positive
This stuff works amazingly If your interested in buying the product dont listen to the people who say it is too dry I thought it worked good and mine was a bit dry This stuff isnt supposed to be really waxy its a hard wax so I would think it was supposed to be cracked Mine wasnt that cracked and it worked great I love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a musthave Amazing,positive
Ive used these for yearsacoustic and electric Very hard to beat I like the feel and texture of these 34pics34 They do the job brilliantly Still The Best,positive
These are great for all around playing Ive never received a bad stick from Amazon These are reasonably priced and so much more convenient than going to Guitar Center and having to deal with the idiot in the drum roomI have a wide variety of Vic sticks that I bought here on Amazon Another favorite is the 2BN its a log with a nylon tip great for heavy metal thrashing very articulateGood music to all My Go To Sticks,positive
No complaints whatsoeverProduct is a solid build and prices rightKnobs work well and the stand doesnt slipLegs hold up pretty well also Well made stand,positive
Come with all cables neededSolid and very much worth the money im very happy with this purchase no regrets at all Great,positive
Im pretty impressed with it Ive only used plugin types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise I ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass I was blown away how it could tune my bass It works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen I would recommend it to anyone Took one star off for visibility Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily Quick and easy,positive
This daisy chain worked very well for me no problems yet Im powering about six pedals currently and I am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound I think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank and it should work with any single spot AC adapter you might already have so no need to buy another Works very well for me no problems,positive
I think i am going to use these sometimes on the bass only found one pick that actaully feels right Good grip,positive
I decided to try these because the 34normal34 picks I was using kept slipping out of my fingers That was several months ago I am still using these everyday Pretty durable and reliable I do recommend these Have been using these ever since first try,positive
Hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music This small acoustic Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 amplifier gives the musiciansinger the needed outside feedback to get things sounding rightNo one hears themselves the way they sound to others This simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music This is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing singing song writer The Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 acoustic amplifier more than does the jobAs the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars I thought a lot for years about trying amplification I probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life Much to my delight together with a passive inexpensive holemounted pickup the Seymour Duncan SA3SC Woody an inexpensive Audio Technica vocal microphone and this Behringer AT108 I can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even betterAt least as importantly it allows me to hear myself more the way I am heard by others who will not hear me as I do in part from the resonations inside my skullOne of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it The mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathomTo hear what those listening hear you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming TO you not FROM you That is where an amplifier comes in handy It aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hearWhen we hear ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback we are hearing a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads The people who hear us only hear us through their ears The two experiences are not the sameTo discover how we really sound to others we can go about it two ways First we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording or we can put our practice through electronics either through an external amplifier or through headphones so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by othersAs an acoustic guitar player I recently invested in a small specifically acoustic amplifier the Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 and have found the results to be simply astounding as I can now for the first time practice my songs until they sound the way I would like them to sound to others before recording themFor a small amplifier that successfully replicates electronically the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier this Behringer AT108 provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice along with a three section equalizer to provide the selfaccompanying guitarist with the sound of what she really sound like to others It can initially be a rather shocking experienceTechnically this AT108 is at the low end of the famous Behringer line Although the company is based in Germany this box is built in China to their specifications Solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping it sports 15 Watts of Power amp output An 8 dualcone fullrange loudspeaker with 4 Ohm impedance and a powerrating of 20 Watts Inputs for an instrument 14 TS mono connector a microphone BalancedXLR and for CDs 14 TRS stereo connector A headphone output connector 14 TRS stereo connector and Three Low Mid and High Range frequency controllersThe unit measures approximately 13 X 14 X 7 inches weighs just over 11 pounds and is easily portable It comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plugin cablingFinally to answer a question I had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp it does NOT make an acoustic guitar sound in any way like an electric guitar The sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic The natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrifiedIt is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue The 15 amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configurationAt a current on line retail of somewhere between 75 95 an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing practicing and listening is now open to me The Behringer AT108 just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments I have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing singing and recording A Nice Smooth 15 Watts,positive

This puppy sounds fantastic The controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top Chorus with deep and intense sound The controls are on the front as are the inout plugs so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs Very reasonable pricing Uses a 9V battery or 9V adaptor It has a retro look and an old school sound perfect Great Chorus sounds for very little cash,positive
I have 2 one spots which came with the 5 multi plug cable after reading a little bit on the internet I read that the one spots can handle almost 10 pedals each depends on the pedal power handling etc So I saw they had an 8 plug cable and figured I would try it out With adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect Def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once One Spot Upgrade,positive
For the price this stand cant be beat You got a mic You need a boom stand here you go Does the job Musicians Gear MS220 Tripod Mic Stand with Fixed Boom Black,positive
Great quality I bought this at the same time as another 71 HD USB sound card but that one break This one has lasted My only complaint is that even with the sound all the way down to 1 it is still fairly loud and I end up turning down the volume in whatever app Im using Too Loud,positive
Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected What can you say about an adapter cord It is well made good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb Works as expected,positive
and thats a good thing I wanted a tuner pedal that I could use under any lighting condition My previous experience with Korg equipment made the Pitchblack a nobrainerTheres not much I can say that hasnt already been said except 34true bypass34 is nonsense If your tone sucks when a device is not on then the problem is somewhere else not in the effect If you want to talk about unity gain on the other hand Im all ears To begin with its a Korg,positive
These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings Great product These Extra Light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead I buy Elixir Nanoweb strings in singles so I can select the gauges that I like even better A great product no matter what gauge string you choose Amazing Guitar Strings Sound New For A Long Time,positive
Great little controller for your DAW or whateverEasy to set up Dials and sliders work smoothlyI use it with ReaperThe 8 sliders and associated dials and buttons are logicallyshiftable so this little darling can handle any number of tracksnot just 8Buy it Awesome,positive
This may be 10Watts but it can fill a big room with its sound Not too heavy and very handy for traveling This cant be used for concert or gigs but for use in privatefamily use or maybe inside a church Built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient Beginner Amp,positive
nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase 90 if they made these pedals Id probablybe all tc electronics What else can I say reverb,positive
Some say dawdareeo deahdareeo dadareeoh or deeahdareeoOthers shorten it to Dadds or even DaddyOs Took me a while to figure that last one outI was trying to find out info about DaddyO strings and why people thought they were so great DuhWhile people may disagree on how to say the name few debate the idea that these are great strings Less expensive that most string sets out there especially if you buy multipacks Colorcoded to make string changes easy Easy to find from most any vendor or music store Made in the USA You can collect players points for SWAG They are sealed in a special environmentally friendly package to keep them fresh and corrosionfree They have one of the widest range of stringsize combinations availableIf you are just starting out and do not know what to put on your new guitar then the phrase set it up with EXL120s or put on some DaDairyO nines is a good choice at least for a strat or telelike guitarI personally like them better than Ernie Ball Super Slinkys aka EB Pinks but I cannot quite put my finger on whyYou can pay more for coated strings cryogenic frozen strings boutique strings and all that but if you do not know what any of those are then you probably havent been playing long enough to find value in themAlmost every guitarist has a set of strings they swear by because they work wonders that no other string can they make them play smoother or faster their last set of strings lasted for 6 years or whateverI just appreciate a great value and DAddario strings are just thatBTW for the record the official pronunciation is DaDairyO We receive letters each week regarding the correct pronunciation of the DAddario name Some years back we even ran an ad that illustrated an easy way to pronounce the DAddario name The name is pronounced phonetically as follows DaDairyO A simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories DaDairyO produces great USAmade strings at a great value,positive
I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy overdrive I love it Its got tone galore I play either a Martin AE thru it or a Strat knockoff Either one sounds awesome Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for 20 Battery life seems OK but I hate messing with batteries so Id buy power supply you can get a 9V supply check for proper polarity at the Thrift store for a buck Dont even think about it Get it 20 is pocket change Tone Galore,positive
very nice compressor I leave it on all the time and it really improves my tonesustain Can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing Quiet much quieter than other compressors in this price range No concerns here nice for the price,positive
If you need some 6 cables to connect your pedals look no farther These cables are perfect They deliver good sound are very small and very cheap What more could you ask for Great pedal cable connectors,positive
sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings bad ears,neutral
Im a beginning player so Im trying to make things as simple as possible starting out I was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic and really didnt want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks This strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar The ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issueThe locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button To attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed Your strap is now locked in place To remove it hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position Thats it Really its that simpleIm a taller guy 6334 and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should I need it longer at some point The leather feels robust and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box Cant wait to see how it does after it breaks in This was a great choice and I couldnt be happier Excellent strap,positive
Ive used several different kinds of strings over several years playing Im no expert but these strings sound good to me Subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing If you havent tried em theyre worth a shot good strings,positive
I wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great The arms are adjustable so the instrument wont rest on the pegs The foam is good and the hardware is included Plus the price is great Great for Hanging a Mandolin,positive
After years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths I love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in Some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered 90 degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time may be due to vibration when packing setting up or maybe its just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface No matter I wont be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron againOne advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size especially when connecting stereo devices Much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws A couple of concerns I had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length As it turns out they dont contribute to higher noise levels and they are just the right length for all my pedal connections Everything is connected using this single length patchLove the color coding too Especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and B channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright lightAnd what to do if one does fail Toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature Ill always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board Its a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff love these patch cables Great Effects Connections,positive
The fact that it is passive really kills it I just could not get any sound out of it I tried multiple placements I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it Not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar Was a waste of money,negative
I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you cant play with a pick in your strings I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock Boy was I wrong The picture is misleading This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks maybe more if they are thin into the wedges on top Stays in place well and is very convenientOnly negative is I dont know how long it will hold up I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks Nice little pick holder,positive
I play my Ipod through a small guitar Amp Great way to wake up the kids Works perfectly for the purpose Keep in mind small end for IPod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono If needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else Use to Plug IPod into Guitar Amp,positive
This simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables Table tops with a routed curved edge reduce how rubber is in contact with the table which will effect how well it stays put Other then that I like it and purcheased a second one It is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs There is also one available that looks like a guitar Simple and Elegant,positive
I bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my Fender x2 champ It has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet It has way more bass and is louder than the stock FenderIt sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby This one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings Great replacement and a definite upgrade Makes the champ a SUPER CHAMP Great upgrade,positive
My acoustic only has the end pin strap button and none at the heel of the neck I was using a bit of string to tie the strap to the headstock but it was ugly This however is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot Highly recommend Better solution then string,positive
I have several capos this one really surprised me for the price Its lightweight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck Compared to my G7th which costs 3 times more it is a great buy I really like Planet Waves products They are made well last Easy to use,positive
This cable is really good for the price i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet Would like to purchase another one in the future Buy it its worth it Very nice clear sounding cable,positive
This is my favorite light weight guitar stand simple and does the job I try to avoid the stands with lever locking mechanisms at the neck rest which are a pain in the arse when you are trying to switch guitars on the fly These are lightweight and collapsible so you can take them anywhere and are sturdy enough for normal use If youre a klutz no guitar stand will be sufficient unless it is encased in carbonite excellent stand for the price,positive
Works well with my PC notebook and my MacBook Pro Sounds good Amazing for the price Good buy Cand go wrong The best,positive
All guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there They vary a bit but basically you have a light 3 pickup versitale guitar that does that job that is about it But this Legacy which I can see as I am typing is much moreFirst the natural finish is what got me started It seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads I looked at 700 Fenders but except for the natural finish what was I getting for 700 I wanted a strat copy that I could customize this is IT I am putting split hot railtype pickups in this and WOW I have a strat 3pickup LP and anything in betweenGet one great guitar for less than 100,positive
Finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use The pivot point doesnt bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models Ive purchased and thrown away over the years The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated works well regardless of string composition typestainless chromes coretypes etc The price seems fair enough Ive seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money but if youre in that big a hurry to change strings youre living life too fast get a roadie to do it for you why have to remember to carry spare batteries Quality and Design,positive
This is exactly what I was looking for the protect my investment I tried purchasing a soft case that had the Seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar it didnt It was way too short for my Seagull S12 Coastline This is a sturdy case that looks good too Fits my Seagull 12string like a glove,positive
These are descent quality cables Great price I own many of these Just a good basic cable Love the price and they shipped quickly Good Cables,positive
Works good nothing special I have to say I disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell My big nose cant confirm that Maybe they corrected the problem if one exited For ten dollars I cant complain,positive
I have a Korg tuner but found that I needed this so it would not pick up sounds in the room and interfere while I was tuning my Dulcimer Now I just plug this into the tuner and thenclip it onto the headstock of my Dulcimer Now I can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise Glad to Own This,positive
Works great but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every timeSome responses to comments Ive seen in the reviewsIve had mine for 5 years used moderately and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible Havent put a pad there or anythingThe manual screw functionality does I feel give an added level of controlyou can make it very tight to ensure no buzzHowever range of motion is on the wide side To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string and screw it down all the way and it does sometimes leave some buzzThe price is nice though so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo A less convenient way to get the job done,positive
I mix and master all my own music on these guys Before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen I cant have giant KRK monitors blasting in my small apartment but what I can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light These are not Beats by Dre they will not make all your songs have super bass and they arent a great fashion statement however they ARE work horses and will show you how your music REALLY sounds Nicer headphones exist true but these are the best in their price range in my opinion They sound great,positive
Works for a cheap bridge on my cheap Stratocaster knockoff Needed one that was better than the bridge that came with it and this was a cheap but not cheaply built option Cheap,positive
the are last forever much better than plastic ones especially if you stay in the light thickens TH ANK you the are last forever,positive
These are my favorite strings to use on my American Strat They feel great sound great and are extremely cheap I would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user buy a pack and try them out For less than 4 you can see if they work well for you AWESOME STRINGS,positive
If you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitarkeyboard sounds this think is GREAT People are trying to hate on this but it is fine I was expecting the worst from the reviews but still wanted it so I got it anyway You dont need the adapter they push the behringer brand 9v best way to work with this is turn all bands ALL THE WAY DOWN then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your defaultnormal sound to hear the difference It works nicely and for the price it was a steal In the future I may get a more expensive one this seems fine for now great addition to the collection,positive
The title says it best its a decent basic mic cable Its nothing special like a canare or mogami but does the job in a nonhigh stress position cable is a bit thin but the supple quality thin those that have high end mic cables will recognize it was priced right 750 usd Decent basic mic cable,positive
The ebow is a crazy concept Its fun to use and also very challenging It comes with a book that had many variations on how to use it which was nice Comes with a velvet pouch and dvd Its a little pricey now I assume from supply and demand but if youve got the extra cash and play every day pick this up Also I played in a band and we did Miserlou and the other guitar player played the trumpet part with an ebow I dont know how he did it or what setting his amp was on but it sound like there was a TRUMPET in the room He clearly was good with an ebow Goes to show how diverse they are Pretty cool,positive
No problems with this Fits my Behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine Like it was made from the same company but its not They must have standard fittings on mikes Works great,positive
This didnt exactly fit my MXL V67G condenser mic so I took out the bottom piece which took a little work then I was able to get the bottom screw plug of my mic to fit Its solid and works well Had to modify,positive
Ive always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees all the way up to you chest the strap never fails Ive owned countless ernie ball straps and I always come back to them for the main reason Ive never had one fail a great strap for a great price the best strap money could buy,positive
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects it comes with a range of wires but I did not like that you camt use the last two ports together the ac ports other than that it good cool,positive
Unless youre going to get a very expensive professional chord this is just as good as any other and works great for medium sized venues Great Value,positive
I ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price This unit is of high quality though Bright but boring effects,positive
this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them useful,positive
Simply one of the best string winders I have ever used to date and I love it because I having large hands it really makes a difference Not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot Very good Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutte,positive
Like most of the other Danelectro pedals this one has a great sound and in this case a fairly inexpensive price though it is higher than most of their other pedals Once again though get the ACDC adapter for it as itll put you in the poor house supplying 9vs to itit eats them like candy Great Sound,positive
I bought this recently and I love it Why It has no 34smell34 it leaves no residue on your hands its very 34light34 but yet it cleans shines and polishes your guitar beautifully It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish it also makes it ultrashiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors This is fantastic stuff If you own a guitar this is the best product out there But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson I was very suprised that it was this effective This little bottle goes a long way I have already polished all of my guitars and my friends guitars and I still have more than 12 a bottle left If you need to polish your guitar look no further This is your best choice OMG All of the positive reviews are spot on Best product out there look no further,positive
great value Good,positive
After first receiving the wrong item not a mike at all Amazon promptly corrected the error and sent the microphone orderedThis microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables The included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect For under twenty dollars PylePro cant be beat Just be mindful its inexpensive because its made in China but it doesnt feel cheap in any wayThe mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the midrange and upper registers while the low end is slightly attenuated For most singers it will be just what they need The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video productionOne issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam D40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue but it usually only occurs using an unbalanced nonXLR input In this case the unbalanced cable that comes with the mike actually works better with the Tascam than the XLR to XLR cable Good Vocalist Mike,positive
I love these picks Great for lead playing and with small fingers like I have they feel great Nice quality pick Smallsize picks for petite hands,positive
I lose picks constantly Years ago I resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when Im not playing it That of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks This thing is great I load it up with alternating hard and soft picks so I can easily swap out between songs Best 3 Ive ever spent Just want Ive been needing,positive
The tuners arrived today I had them shipped to my business address It took me longer to get home from work than it took me to remove the stock tuners replace them with these Perfect fit they look great Easy upgrade for my Mexican Strat,positive
Works great with my Baritone Ukulele Same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo Easily fits in my ukulele case too Kyser Ukulele Capo,positive
I mostly play metal 76 string extended scale and usually lean towards heavy duty picks such as Dava for riffs But these picks are pretty amazing The diamondsteel pattern creates a lot of grip and it is pretty hard to drop one of these compared to a basic pick This is a great product and would definitely recommend this to any level of player Great little picks,positive
this will work for just about everyonebut i prefer the walker williams brandbut these work fine easy to get strap locks onwill keep on the side for next guitaryou shouild be happy enjoy works fine good price,positive
Fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands If you have the smaller screw headed ends on your microphone stand you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing Maybe a dollar if they dont just give it to youUsing this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the wayNo need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out getting in the way plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over themThe base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tightThe set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the cameraThe set screw presses against a ballsocket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile I am very careful not to overtighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knobI am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing but at this price I guess you cant expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism ehThere is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a 90degree preset angleThe metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your cameraBe careful The metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras I found a little plastic threaded washerlike ring that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use You could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc to hold it in place when in storage or transport You could also leave it attached to your camera Either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lostOverall the little thing is quite solid heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small basic solid and inexpensiveIt holds well when bumped or moved Mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose I would not put a larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter Most modern devices will do just fineAgain just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well Dont put the grip of Hercules on it and it should last for years Mine hasIm happy with mine and bought our drummer one for ChristmasHope this helps I Like This Little Camera Adapter for Mic Stands,positive
By definition medium is an in between size But when it comes to guitar strings most of the range goes from extra light to medium On that scale these strings would be above a literal medium For me the guitar is not an everyday instrument I dont typically spend five hours a day with one and sometimes go weeks without picking one up But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and dont want something that will kill meMedium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me Light and custom light are easier to play but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line For me these lightmedium are exactly where I want my strings to beIf you like Martins medium find them a bit much at times but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones you may find that these are a great choice I dont feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison But without that I dont think Id notice the difference with normal listening With the lighter varieties that would be far from trueIf Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1 milk of strings these lightmedium would be the 2 that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste A great choice for Martin strings,positive
Recieved the accessory kit only to find I was missing the black tip for the fiveway switch and tremolo bar tip Trem back cover fit nicely and the knobs help me complete a few other project Saving the pu covers for my next project but it would be nice to get the trem tip and switch tip sent to meGreat customer service Received missing parts immediately Finished the project I definitely will be using this seller again Thanks Hey Im missing some stuff,positive
I BOUGHT A UKULELE TO GIVE AS A PRESENT I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME EQUIPPED ON NEW MUSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF POOR QUALITY SO I PURCHASED THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A REPLACEMENT IVE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS AM FOND OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN PRODUCTS THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS AVAILABLE THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME MARTIN UKULELE STRINGS REVIEW,positive
This review is legitI bought this mixer back in august or september cant really remember but i had a horrible experience with this unit but thats my fault i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything so i didnt know how to use itI hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input and got a horrible terrible mix the hiss from the fan ruined it i nearly had a panic attack so i took like 9 months to do research and found out that behringer made the uca202uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer to remove the hiss and unwanted noiseSo buy this with the uca202uca222 to clear up your recordings do not buy a rca to 35mm cable if your using this for a studio setting like me and if your beginning like me do not let these wealthy people fool you you dont need thousand dollar equiptment the podcaststudio usb from behringer would be fineSo all in all with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer the quality was good but the hiss ruined it Use a usb audio interface with this from behringer do it if you want 5 star audio quality Their website has asio drivers to assist you ohhh and go on YouTube and search up uca202 studio youll get videos to helpPlease please please please do research before you buy anything Good day everyone D Please do not buy this if you dont know how to use it,positive

Before I purchased the FBV I scoured the web to see how it works with the POD HD Desktop and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinkingAnyway I lucked out and found a used one going cheap and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the POD HD desktop FBV Express II combo1 First in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express Yes I know this sounds dumb but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for2 Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal there is no need to dl the FBV software for thisNow In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD or to be FS5FS8 This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBVSo In ABCD mode you cana Select preset A B C or D from the group you are currently inb Insert a volume FX and use volume pedalEXP2c Insert another FX enabled by toe switch and controlled by pedal as EXP1d tap temp by tapping the currently selected presetie the pedal that is lite enable the tuner presshold the current selected preset pedalf you have some basic control of the looper but CANNOT enable it31014 EDIT Looper control is flawed You can record and go to overdub but you cannot record then playstop the loop you can stop from overdub but not start the loop seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough but if you are like me switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on off incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal say turns OD on and delay chorus both off or turn one amp on and one off channel switching YAY you cry that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5FS8 it is for meSO yup in FS58 mode you can do that you cana enabledisable 4 sets of blocks using the four pedalsb use volume and expression options as above ie like volume or wah overdrive level delay FB etcc basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 31914 looper control flawed as stated abovec enable the tuneroh sod it nope you cantd tap tempo nope not that eitherSo in summary the Express is better than nothing but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop the shortboard is worth the extra or if you are reading this before buying the pod get the HD500x instead Express MkII and POD HD Desktop dont bother,negative
It holds all my acoustics perfectly Its light but stays in place okay Rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like theyll last a while Two really nice things about this design 1 it folds up very nicely and becomes pretty small 2 the all black and slim armslegs design makes it look nicer in a room It pretty much disappears when you put a guitar on it so Im able to have it out without offending my wife simple and functional,positive
Decent quality for the price Fits the acoustic guitar as intended and seems comfortable to the person it was purchased for Guitar strap works well,positive
I loved it very much It is very sturdy and stable It holds my shockmount with my Audio Technica AT2020 just perfectly and it does an amazing job Very sturdy desktop stand,positive
This doesnt look very robust I expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in 6ft of it consider it broken The swivle hinge is secure and will hold its position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weakThe backing board mine came with is about 23 the size of a full sheet of paper make what you will of that and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a riskOverall a reasonable value and Im glad I bought it Petty good like other reviews say,positive
This strap is comfortable has plenty of room to expand it to fit and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you Perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes I really like it Perfect for small instrument,positive
Ive always liked Behringer products There prices are pretty reasonable and the quality cant be beatI just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one Let the groove begin,positive
I held out from trying the Boss SD1 Super Overdrive for many years Like many guitarists my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS1 which was durable and aggressive but also extremely frustrating I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss when it was probably unfair to do soThe SD1 is widely owned and very affordable usually around 50 Its similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much A lot of guitarists consider the SD1 to be more of a rock overdrive while the TS9 is more of a tubeblues effect Theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedalsHowever the SD1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel But that isnt necessarily the best use for the pedal it excels as a booster pushing an already overdrive amp or stacking with other distortionOD pedals One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone and really sounds greatA feel that lot of people give the SD1 mediocre reviews for reasons that arent fair You hear things like it cuts out too much bass when thats really what the pedal is supposed to do The midrange hump when set up properly can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing And like I said before I feel as if its MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS9 though preference between the two is entirely subjectiveBut you also know that its a Boss pedal which means its as durable as they come The thing will stand up to years of abuse and can be used in any number of roles If youre looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound big there are probably better options in this range Try the underappreciated MD2 Mega Distortion or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose youll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years A versatile overlooked classic overdrive from BOSS,positive
This thing is awesome It doesnt take up a lot of room and has a tone of options for connectionsand its way cheaper than a power box Love it,positive
I am not a sound guy I just wanted something to plug in and record my practice sessions This is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instrumentsThe four direction settings are fun though I find myself using the stereo or cardioid settings the most The nodelay headphone jack is great I was impressed the first time I plugged everything in and tried it out its nice to hear how my playing sounds from an outside standpointSetup was easy and quick I have experienced a few times when plugging it in registered it as a recording device but failed to actually use it This may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventuallyI am quite happy with the build quality The base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly The body and buttons are plastic but solid they dont feel or look cheap My favorite new toy,positive
I am totally satisfied with the stand I had some misgivings after reading some negative reviews on Amazon but this stand serves me well The misgivings I had was with the extra weight I intended to place on it with my tablet stand equipment and the Samsung tablet However I am very happy to report that it handles the extra weight very well and does topple over even when the boom is extended with the mic and space needed for the tablet and guitar playing I easily reommend this Item On Stage Stand MS7701,positive
the mat is only a few neoprene kind of mat the neck holder thing is inserted in the tube that contain the mat TAKE IT OUT very very carefully I was only careful and the base of the neck holder broke a bitIn my opinion this thing if priced 15 or 20 less will be what it really worth on the marketPSThe Wise Man SayDo yourself a favor use a long pillow over your desk to tune upintonate your Strat or Tele and use this to buy good strings D not impressed by the quality Fender shouldnt put the name on low quality stuff like this,neutral
No problems at all with this product Works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from Amazon I would recommend this product works well,positive
The issue isnt whether it sounds exactly like a 34Tube Screamer34 the issue for me at least is does it sound good Is it musical Does it sound like an overdriven ampI say it does It sounds great for blues and rock Ive only had it for a couple weeks and I hope that it continues to work well for a long time Ive heard that these can be fragile but Im pretty gentle with my gear If it breaks Ill post about it Tube Screamer Clone,positive
My kids are all interested in learning the Uke This one really appealed to my son because of the front design Plays well and keeps in tune Another one for the collection,positive
I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal but I didnt have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer So I took a chance on this little stompbox from China It compares itself to the TS right on the box and for good reason They use the same chip More importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedalboard space The onoff switch seems a little chintzy but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with and plugging in to a power supply not provided with unit It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine Its responds well to your technique and you can make it so funky you can smell it It truly does have true bypass and logical controls I dont have A TS to make direct comparisons but for the money this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks BaDa Bing The tone you want for cheap,positive
The right pick is a personal preference Nothing wrong with Dunlop Stubby Pick but its not for me I bought a pack of 20mm picks last year and loved them but left them in Florida when I went north I forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake Good pick not great,neutral
Long wait for overpriced item Arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait Overpriced but was expected as Fender name on product Long wait for overpriced item,neutral
Im reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer and I finally did after nearly throwing in the towel Turns out I was using my mixers CDTape switch incorrectly thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback I finally went on You Tube and found a Behringer guy that has a video thats less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer Just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple I was doing wrong I was overthinking it Once I got it to working correctly I could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly including the control on my PC that controlled the recording volume for this unit So now Im looking forward to doing some real recording with it using Audacity as my main recording software Edit I did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really really pleased with the results I can hardly wait to do some more recording with this So to the arrogant salesman who badmouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a 15000 Lexicon unit I wont be needing that Im quite happy with this little interface thank you very much And to everyone else dont forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your PC and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock onboard sound card Thanks Behringer this is a great value Excellent sound quality better than onboard sound card,positive
If you are playing a guitar that costs several hundreds to several thousand dollars why would anyone buy a cheap guitar strap to hold it up I have friends who think straplocks are the best invention of the century but I believe in buying a quality guitar strap Levys produces some of the best on the market I own several acoustic electric guitars for the most part I have a strap for each one except the pieces too valuable to take to a gig Every strap is a LevysIll call myself a veteran pro guitarist I dont believe in using the word old who gigs about 12 15 days a month This strap is comfortable to wear strong enough to hold up my Gibson Les Paul Standard without any worries of dropping it Ive watched friends bandmates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps I offer my advise to buy a quality strap find most continue to use crap straps BUY IT You will love it Levys Leather Straps,positive
its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin came with a few which is nice price was right so why notgo for it Patch Adams,positive
These are my favorite strings for electric guitar Ive been using them since I started playing about eighteen years ago Ive tried other strings like Gibson and DAddario but I like the sound and feel of Ernie Balls the best they feel nice full thick hefty I play blues jazz and bluesy rock I use these on a Gibson Les Paul Vintage Mahogany and a Yamaha neckthrubody electric and they are good for the music I play and for providing a fullbodied sound There are a whole host of big name guitarists who use these strings and for good reason I buy them in 10 packs to save money cant seem to find that option here on Amazon My favorite strings for electric,positive
I purchased several thicknesses for my son so he can test them all to determine which ones he liked best These 10 are not the ones he likes I would not get these again in this size A little too stiff The quality of the picks and grip are great and that is why I rated 4 stars The stiffness is just due to preferencePlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help Good picks with great grip,positive
I have always loved Hercules products Their mic stands and guitar stands They are great quality and very handy especially this one for performances where 3 guitars are used Absolutely Great,positive

Really helpful both in live gigs and at homeGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Practical,positive
Bought two sets Both arrived together and at the expected delivery date I had bought two sets of the Pyle Pro PMDK102 months previously which also included a pair of 25ft 14 cabling from an Amazon dealer which arrived without problems Initially I noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles Personally I think its easier to setup the Pyle Pro PSTK103 Later comparison showed that the PSTK103 is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker poleHowever the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products The paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs There were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing Why I blame the manufacturers packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and sidebyside within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton no other forethought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded Really how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foamOn the plus side after testing each of the tripod stands all seemed to function perfectly well The units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up The price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved I would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy Only time and after some use hereafter will I be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain Maybe A Good Buy However Packaging Is Extremely Poor,neutral
Ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job Yes it could be metal and I wish the button gave a satisfying click when I step on it For under thirty clams I can look past these things I have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation I really have no complaints at all with its performance so I am glad I didnt shell out 34X more money so I can feel more secure when I unlatch my pedal board in front of gearsnobs I dont think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job opening up the sound of boxy or dark sounding amps When I run it in the effects loop of my Palomino V8 great little practice amp btw that little amp sounds HUGE Also great in front of my Blues Jr If you own an amp with a single tone knob Pro Jr Valve Jr etc or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these Even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amps controls this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead Once my sound is dialed in I leave typically leave it on and forget about it Its also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar GREAT PEDAL FOR THE MONEY,positive
These are great have 3 of them now I use them when I play with my duet and sometimes with the band Used to plug in but the batteries last a good while so I rarely use the cord anymore there are enough cords in my life I use a 3 ring binder with lyrics and fake chords these light up everything pretty well Only complaint the clip isnt the best but its never fallen off or anything like that Will but another one if any of them die great product Best light ever,positive
What is there to say If youre looking at this cable then you must have some knowledge of tone loss Simple if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal buy Mogami I have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches Mogami Sure you can buy the expensive Analysis Plus Pro and Evidence Audio cables But you will NOT hear a difference Lifetime warranty and you wont be replacing it any time soon Works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio All I own are Mogami cables Check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord Goodbye pops and noise You want the best tone buy Mogami,positive
FYI Parchment is slightly off white unless youre comparing right next to a pure white pickguard you probably would think theyre simply white good quality,positive
One of the the best lights I own Small but fills a gym with light for under 100 what more could you ask As the other reviewers boast this is a great unit and I hope it lasts a long long time Fills a gym,positive

Great little piece of leather Does what I want it to do and does not hurt my guitar Thank you CF Martin Co 18A0031 Guitar Leather Head Stock Strap Tie,positive
I recently bought this May 2011 to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works finePROS Nonoily waterlike consistency leaves no residue behind slight nonchemical odor that doesnt linger on your guitar removes smudges fingerprints etc and leaves a nice shine comes with a large lint and dustfree fastdrying cloth black less expensive than most other guitar polishesCONS The pump sprays in a very wide area so be careful to avoid spraying strings pickups etcThe polish in the bottle works well and the lintfree cloth works well too I cant see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine Works well no problems,positive
Good length but very slippery I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesnt slide around I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now For the price why not Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric As far as the base product it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear slippery and young,neutral
Ive owned several inexpensive Korg lcd tuners over the years Like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable I keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs Another winner from Korg,positive
The material used is fine The looks are fine The length is horrible This is too short for most adults that play guitar It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use To me this was a worthless purchase I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again Not for me,negative
The cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth Just feels right for the job Call me crazy but the cloth is awesome,positive
These are great tuners and they look great Ive never had a lot of interest in locking tuners except on my floyd rose guitars Fender quality,positive
This a solid performing unit at this price point Ive been using this alongside my laptop for as long as I remember and it works the same as the day I bought it The two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to useMy only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap But this is still a great USB interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than 60 Doing the job for three years,positive
As I mentioned in my review about guitar polish already forgot what kind Im not really a guitar polish connoisseur but this makes my fingerboards feel real good It got rid of that scratchy feeling when I bent strings dissolved the crud and makes the fretboard look just lovely It probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say Again because Im rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing this bottle will also last me years For a honeylike feel,positive
These are guitar picks and I dont play guitar so I cant say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were It is what it is,positive
I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and its amazing stuff I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year Its easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two there isnt really any reason to just soak everything with it I dont think I mainly use it to clean the strings Im really glad I found this stuff This stuff is great and a container lasts a really long time,positive
I have owned almost every octaveharmonizerpitch shifter on the market For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of you cant beat it First off Its polyphonic You wont find that in anything else under 300 Instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design Only two flaws a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam Great job Mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff Best Octave Bang For The Buck,positive
Any guitarist knows how one of these works Clamp it on the head turn it on and tune Ive tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass My only real complaint is that it often takes 34 seconds to register the note its getting It occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well The low E on my bass will occasionally register as a B 3rd harmonic for example In general the dullest means of plucking the string finger instead of pick will give the quickest and most glitchfree pitch All in all its a handy little tool to have in the gig bag Works well but a little slow,positive
Guitar bag fit over my Fender T Bucket guitar Cheap price and does the job It has just enough padding and heavy duty nylon to protect my acoustic from being scratched Worth 24 5 stars for the cheap price and quality,positive
Bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap Nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar More for electric guitars,positive
Really nice cable Ive had mine for over a year now And it has worked flawlessly No problems with distortion or noise Build quality is as solid as they come Nice gold tips and polished finish for great connectivity Keep it professional And become a Monster I did Monster Wired,positive
I have to confess to a particular image that comes to mind when I think of capos Its the image of an earnest folkie with mastery of C G and D but still struggling with the A A good player should be comfortable in any key But theres still an occasional place for a capo and thats when you need open strings in a chordI tested this capo on several guitars and with one exception it worked well Steelstring dreadnought archtop jazz box and Les Paul worked nicely Not so much on a flat fretboard classical The capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck But on a flat neck theres a little string buzz on the D and G strings While the capos grip is good it still needs to be fitted right behind the fret This means that it can get a little bit in the way for passage work Thats probably a rare problem for the intended userAll in all its a nice little capo Goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks Good capo for curved fingerboards,positive
Much better than the more economical ones sold I should have gotten the 15 foot but you live and learn My studio is small but it needs to wrap around my desk and go into my soundproof closet It matches my awesome AT2035 microphone Nice quality,positive
I purchased this to use with my old Yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele It works great on both very accurate and easy to use The swiveling head works very nicely and makes it easy to see at any angle It appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument I havent used other tuners of this type but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price Great tuner,positive
Someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than I did The first one worked great and so does this one I would recommend this product to everybody My second One,positive
I got this to plug into my computer It comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos The unit itself works as planned even though i think i may stick with Sonar as far as a editor Sorry Behringer maybe later The quality and durability are there 100 well worth what i paid for Good plug in,positive
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT The Behringer VT999 Vintage Tube Monster is indeed a monster of a pedal Those seeking a hot rodded sound to your amp would be wise to check this product out as the level of boost and gain derived from the stock 12AX7 is enough to push any tube amps clean channel into saturated overdriveFeaturing 3band EQ that ranges from barely noticeable to perhaps 34too much34 I was surprised that I actually found myself backing off some of the knobs because I expected this to be a cheap pedal that needed its EQ to be pushed to max in order to get any playable tone out of it I was wrong The Master and Gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel The Noise Suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noiseRoughly taking up the space of 3 standard pedals on your pedalboard many probably wonder if its even worth the real estate compared to other overdrives However when it comes to tubebased pedals big is par for the courseThe stock tube is decent to the point where you can get some musical tones out of the pedal I personally dont plan on changing the stock tube any time soon because I want to test its limits but the gain range is effectively Boss OD1 to DS1 so YES it is possible to get some metal tones out of this pedal especially those late 80searly 90s Marshalldriven metal tonesI honestly cant say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal I judge gear with my EARS and by its VALUE not by PRICE but honestly for 50 you literally cant go wrong There are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly Even with a 1015 mod to change the tube to something more your preference youre still looking at a relatively inexpensive pedal with an amazing value But if youre looking for other tube overdrives check these out Effectrode Tube Drive 350 Maxon TBO9 True Tube BoostOverdrive 263 and the Ibanez Tube King 170If youre on the fence with this thing go ahead and jump over and get one Tubed Screamer,positive
item is really convienient Small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading I like the swivel design swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want Price cant be beat either effortless compact tunermetronome,positive
Not an exciting item Ill admit but they work as advertised and I do love having strap buttons on my instruments Work great get the job done,positive
I dont like that I have to continually tighten the knob at the back of the stand to keep the neck rest from tilting or moving and eventually falling down The solution Tighten the crap out of it with a wrench until you get it very snug and it wont budge I dont like that I have to continually tighten the knob at,neutral
Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat You cant with this Its too narrow at 17 inches I am going with a wider one other than that is seems decentUpdated March 4th 2014 I ordered the On Stage KT7800 and have had it for several weeks now I am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust The first one I ordered was defective and I had to send it back butt now I am good to go Too narrow for me,neutral
As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks I am no exception Dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the 30 dollar picks you name it Ive tried it even nail picking on metal strings Now if you are new to the 34perfect pick quest34 you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your Grail different However if you play a light metalstring acoustic my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar check out these Dunlops 60 NylonsEven within the Dunlop line I have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same 60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the sameWould I try another pick if the chance was presented Sure most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends but until then Dunlops 60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection Seeking the Holy Grail of Picks,positive
While on the surface the pocket sounds great the picks either fall out because they arent pushed in far enough or they are impossible to grab because they are pushed in too far There is also a tendency for the picks to fall out when you put the guitar on a stand which is a bit annoyingThe strap itself is just fine and is a good price but the pocket idea sounded better on paper than it works in real life Pocket idea was better than the implementation,positive
This pick holder works for me It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed It fits my Jasmine well Buy it from GODPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products Good pick holder,positive
I hope there had been a closer picture of the productI was a little surprised when I got it because it doesnt look as great as I imaginedThe white lightning is stamped on the black strap the same goes for the GIBSON name on the end of itMaybe it will get better looking in the long run Lighting bolt Gibson strap,positive
I like the capo only it seems a little stiff when opening it up to put it on or take it off It was actually a bronze color instead of gold but thats not a big deal to me Im interested on the durability of this but for the price how can you go wrong nice deal,positive
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitarused on open tunings and bass as well as my Mandilin Used daily,positive
These are my goto strings They are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding What more do you need Excellent strings,positive
This little Guitarlele is great I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well It gives a gently subdued tone that is perfect for playing any time even accompanying music on the TV whilst the family are watching I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six monthsAdded infoNow that the tuning has settled down it is keeping tune very well with no need to retune during playingThe strings it came with are not the best though they are wearing through all ready What fun,positive
I have a 5 watt combo amp I was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube It lacks the brutal attack of the Sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the NOS RCA gray plate I tried for over a year but Im really liking this sound for what it is I think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical with nice natural compression and thats what Im getting out of this JJ Smooth and dark,positive
wish i would have bought 4 of the 20 footersgoing to buy more of them for sure they are great guitar cables great cables,positive
They call these mini tuners but to me they are just right Some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho I installed them on a PRS SE Santana in just a few minutes They were direct drop ins To use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks Then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock insert the string and then turn the tuning peg Youll feel it 34lock in34 then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune They are really good tuners and I think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer Great Tuners,positive
It works and it is relatively inexpensive I keep it in the original packaging so that it stays fresher and it really makes the finish on my guitar shine like new Does what it is supposed to do,positive
Great value Works great Easy assembly Must fully expand base before you set guitar in it Five Stars,positive
i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room this does the trick just fine it is light sort of cheap etc but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg I wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home practicing it is just fine inexpensive and does the trick,positive
When I bought my first guitar about 6 months ago I just chose a pack of picks on Amazons list of other buyers also bought this and those were these Fender 351 picksAt the time I figured all picks were created equalSince then Ive tried various sizes and brands Dunlop Planet Waves etcBut I keep coming back to this Fender 351 Medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitarThe sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too treblyThe Planet Waves picks all seem to be a little muddysoundingIve found a winner with these Fender picks and will definitely be ordering more Best pick Ive tried so far,positive
Good strings for my electric guitarI liked the product a lotClean sound easy to change and much more Good,positive
I have used the Manhasset orchestra light and this is definitely an improvement it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page unlike the Manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven It illuminates my entire largeManhasset M54 Regal Conductors Music Standquite well by itselfHaving said that for a 40 bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me In both construction and light brightness it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights all of which are usually much cheaper the issue being mainly the light switch the jury is out about the clamp though it seems strong Of course as an orchestra light it couldnt be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose I am just pointing out that I feel it isnt worth 40 dollars when you consider the whole field of similar lights those not intended for orchestraI bought this because of reputation and reviews but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clipon 9 LEDS with Adapter That one has the same negative issues as this light but at a much more acceptable 1899 plus free shippingOne more thing you should ignore the Frequently Bought Together suggestion to get theMighty Bright 80910 Bright Light Cradlefor this light I bought it and can confirm they are totally incompatible and anyways this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping if desired Great for its intended purpose do not buy the cradle,neutral
These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar I dont like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups etc Big disappointment Im getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem Back to the drawing board I go Want rubber residue all over your guitar,negative
I have an AxeFx 2 that requires quality monitoring I do use studio monitors but sometimes I need something that no one else can hear and for a while was using the Senheiser HD 280 Pro headphonesWhen I put these on without burning them in I was blown away at the difference for 20 more these cans are more than worth the extra cashAlso better is the leather wrapped around the arc much sturdier while the pad on my Senheisers is flaking off piece by piece Finally Something accurately monitors my AxeFx 2 for less than 150 Blows Senheiser HD 280 pro out of the water,positive
Its a little unstable at times but the fasteners and adjustment areas on this stand do keep the stand in place and such that it can be good for a sound studio or classroom setting not sure if I would recommend it for professional use but thats why you spend more for better quality right Does the job,positive
This amp is awesome Its great JUST like its advertised I play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the Fender Fuse software Fender Fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire The amp itself has 24 presets as advertised are shown in 3 different colors Red Green Orange and you can totally customize the presets So if you want 24 different distortions go for it Another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials learn how to use it record some music but you cant save them bummer i know BUT it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings One last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal about 20the Fender mustang 12 can only USE the 1 button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses 2 buttons or up can only be use by Fender Mustangs 3 up REMEMBER THIS Great Amp for the price,positive
Im using these on the mandolin Perfect for clear loud picking When I want a more gentle muted tone I use DAndrea Pro 346These are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured I have very small hands so they work for me They are not slippery which helps Try These On the Mandolin,positive
Has a good sound Stays in tune Wish it came in a darker grain of wood A little bulky My arm goes to sleep sometimes after extended playing wish it was a little thiner I bought it because I wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price Good guitar for the price,positive
I dont have any real praise or complaints about this I does just what it should and for the price its pretty good Like most pedals it can be used with a 9V plugin transformer but its not included Yes its made of plastic but you cant expect any more for 25 Not bad for the price,positive
I usually use fender 73 picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while I was playing and it was very irratating So I picked these up I no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand The star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it Hands down the best pick Ive used Great,positive
I use a variety of guitars from an old 50s gibson acoustic to a new nylon string acoustic I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2inch nut width guitars as well It has a springloaded clamping arm that can have the clamping strength increased or decreased and this works well Above the adjustable clamping device is a narrow slit to hold a guitar pick and theres also a holder for a tuner I use neither of these so I have no comment on their usability But for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered and is an excellent product A Surprising Accessory,positive
This is a great stand it looks the same as any other but it works great for about 10 dollars Way better than the musicians gear,positive
You need this to get the most out of your SuperChamp XD amp The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic No telling how long the switches will last Fender tends to make good products Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO Footswitch,positive
I replaced the original Indiana guitar tuners with the Fender Locking Tuners and what a difference I had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling Then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them The locking mechanism is great It acts like a vice in a woodshop project And all I need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just dont go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times I bend the strings These are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune Perfect Pitch,positive
More likely known as a guitar compensation device the effect itself it widely used in everything I have couple few behringer pedals some complain about plastic housings but a I dont beat my gear and b plastic doesnt get rust and corrosion The build on behringer are tough and fine to me and the prices make them attainable to all players The only thing I say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals gotta spring for power supply plug if not now eventually because itll drive you nutsCompressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just cant not have if thats your thing The sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build so even a cheap one can ring like the bestSo you got both in one tailoring will add life to even a dull axe Some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you cant do without once you find em Likely used in everything,positive
Its a good OD but I thought it would be higher output and more articulate Just personal preference I mean the Pedal is a Classic for a reason Great just not what I was looking for in sound,neutral
Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultrathin coat and brighter sound Theyre easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound Because theyre coated and have antirust they last up to months longer than regular strings and dont make much finger sounds Favorite strings Best strings,positive
This is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal I have one of these for each of my guitars and theyre as accurate as anything else Ive used Handy,positive
tough to even strech this into a full reviewthis is a no brainer great strings an industry standard at a great price whats nor to love no sense passing it up,positive
I am a beginner guitar player I have a Yamaha F335BL and a Hohner HC06 I bought the Yamaha a few years back and just recently started to really learning to play it It sounds ok but not great though the Price is pretty good for it It is all laminated and the action is pretty highLooking online I saw that people really liked the Seagull S6 Original for its sound and price point Boy were they right I got this guitar from Guitar Center after I tried it out The action is low and the fretboard is bigger for fingerstyle and beginners this is really good The sound is also REALLY good its very resonant and just sounds 34good34 It is hard to describe the sound you woul dhave to hear itI did replace the pins with Presentation Tusq Pins I could not really tell a difference in sound but it did make it look nicerHighly recommend this and other guitars from Seagull try the Merlin its fun Great sound at a great price,positive
To start with I didnt buy this guitar because it was cheap but because of the unbelievable reviews I dont know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12 my Yamaha 12 my ovation 12 but I wont be selling this one Ive had it for 3 months now and havent adjusted anything only played this 169 12 string from American Musical Supply amazon It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases 2 one for my son AJ220SCEs and ES339 Also great guitars Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk not anymore and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them I own Gibson Studio Les Paul SG 87 American Strat Martin D35 Washburn Rogue all nice guitars most for a LOT more money This guitar is a NOBRAINER cannot believe the value American Musical Supply is also great the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one 5 star service my forth 12 string in 40 years,positive
I bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my Hondo II The Paul which I bought in 1980 The stock ones were loose lots of backlash in the worm gears and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still newThey went in easily if you follow this hint if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged disregard this hint The holes for the old machine heads on the Hondo II were 0305 in diameter and these new Grovers need a 0390 diameter hole So I had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes Its almost impossible to use a drill even in a drill press without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock I read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc So what I did was first use a threading tap for metal screw threads which at the bottom had a 0290 diameter and at the top had a 0375 diameter This is a standard 3824 threading tap I chucked the tap into my batterypowered hand drill set to low speed and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0375 in diameter Then I used a tapered reamer from both sides to enlarge the holes to the required diameter Quick clean easy If you have a different size enlargement to make use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0390 diameterAnother hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time like when changing strings You dont want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod At least I dont want toNow the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tuneA very worthwhile upgrade Zero backlash in the worm gears on the Grovers beautifully chromed and smooth as silk A very worthwhile upgrade,positive
As a newbie violin student I needed a music stand Having purchased many things before through Amazoncom I have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted remembering that there will always be a few cranks This music stand got good reviews and I can say that I too am very happy with it I would recommend this purchase to any one Music Stand Review,positive
Another quality product from Hosa Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch No noise from this cable GOOD INSERT CABLE,positive
I like the durability of it and the onoff switch it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder adapter its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used i havent tried this through a PA live yet i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on Much Better than my old mic,positive
Fine productive been using it for 1 monthno dirty thread or any issue with itleather is bit tough at first time Good,positive
Im a new user but seem to be a Great product Cant complaint I finally got it and saw how great it is It has plenty of roomy pockets great padding and is put together with great quality Acoustic Guitar Bag,positive
Tuner works great Both by vibration and micOnly real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak Mine broke off not even a year old Tuner is great joints not so much,negative
This sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off Remember I would not use this with any kind of polish a little pricey but then again arent our toys Good item,positive
Its been a while since last we got together The old amps we had were way too big For me this one is just rightFender Mustang I Electric Guitar Amplifier Now were jammin,positive
This is the newer version of the original Snarks I have bought the red blue and older black models These are great Fast and reliable and accurate This new Super Tight is a bit faster and is slightly more accurate than the others but the older units are still excellent The display is a little brighter but I think the battery life is a little less than the originals I cant recommend these enough I have bought many Snarks,positive
I bought two for 10 bucks each They work great on my acoustic and electric guitars Easy to see and it centers quickly when tuning without drifting all over the place The only thing I would do to improve is add an off button There is an ON button but the tuner will stay on as long as you are pluckingstrumming strings It will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing but I usually start right into playing after tuning The only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life This is a great little tuner and I am glad I bought it Great tuner,positive
This tuner works great I am not able to vouch for accuracy who but the best tone person can Convenioence and quick,positive
I have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig but not enough power for 13 pedals This totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues Very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for DC distribution A Great Idea,positive
Guardian Well it is padded but Ive only gigged once since having the item with 3 rehearsals held prior and I can say that the case is nicked up pretty good as they say in the South Yes it will last because it is a guitar case but theres no way theres enough security to protect an instrument on a plane Now thats for flight cases to handle but dont even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the guardian fails to guard against crushing your hardware This item is not one of the better cases out there but it does suffice and it does look good The first day I got it someone said nice case it looks great Say that now though after using it outside the house 4 times and youd be a lying SOB Guardian Well it is padded,neutral
This is what these things should cost and this is how they should work I will be trying this out in a chain of effects as the single power supply so I will report back if it cannot do that Works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power Enough said Right Price Point Works Great,positive
Before I bought this I had to use a tuner on my laptop Now I just clip it on to my ukulele and tune it in a matter of seconds I also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument It doesnt matter how much noise there is in the room it still tunes perfectly every time Great Little Tuner,positive
I play harp with some some that I perform I found that all of these Harmonicas the notes are off and its hard to play I have G Blues harp that I compared the G harp to and the notes were a little off The C harp was terrible That said the only thing I like about this order is the case I going to see if I can return them for store credit Notes off Hard to play,negative
For under 200 Im amazed at how nice this guitar is First it was perfectly playable right out of the box all I had to do was tune it And it stays in tune nicely tooI did replace the strings shortly after getting it There was nothing wrong with the original strings no rust and they sounded fine I just wanted something softer so I put on Dedario Silk and Steel light strings which are much easier on my fingers and have a nice mellow sound I am a novice transitioning from a nylon string guitar so I needed the most gentle strings I could get Now this guitar is a joy to play Problem is I get nothing done because I cant put it downAnd the spruce top is pure eye candy as are the mahogany back and sides And I like the mother of pearl Yahama inlay on the headstock Very classy The quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch It just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your handsYou can spend a lot more on a guitar but why would you want to when you can get something like this Beautiful guitar Great value,positive
Sounds ok on its own not very loud or good quality at any high volume but then when you plug in some good headphones AWESOME Great gain tone high volume sounds awesome perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect Great sound awesome deal Score D Perfect with headphones Smaller than your toaster,positive
I use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano I have a pro model with XLR outs to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces Works every time Balanced signal is so much betterno more issues with ground loops or other problems Just clear as a bellThey were cheap and the build quality is fine Nice cables Love those balanced connections,positive
i knew it would be small but i wasnt thinking this small it shore is cute good enough for now but not for the longrun shore its loud for the size but it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides from vibrationif you keep it on lower sound its fine this is only for temporary use for me its an ok tiny mini little amp for its size its good dont exspect a fender amp thats all mini amp that it is,positive
Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac This is the industries best mic as far as I am concerned I had a Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a SM58 SM 58 is garbage compared to the Beta 58A Spring for the extra bucks and be happy Thats what I always say Best All Around Mic For Live Applications,positive
Ive been playing with my brothers Lunchbox and when he first plugged in for a jam at his house I thought he was joking This amp can easily cut through drums even in the close confines of his practice studio Granted I am not a heavy hitter but we were messing around with come classic rock from the early 60s and this amp at three on the volume knob was plenty loudThe tone is very good but not exceptional Its not as clean as a Fender or Jazz Chorus but its still better than many of the amps Ive listened to If you want to make this a spectacular tome machine plug aBoss FBM1 Fender 59 Bassman Pedalinto itAbout the quirks The ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb It does give a halllike sound as you increase it but was designed to simulate an open back amp more than a true effect The gain controls the input signal to the amp and according to the manual is more like a soft overdrive The volume level is solely controlled with the volume knob with the gain knob playing no real role in how loud the amp gets Finally the speaker switch on the rear is for turning the internal speaker on and off not the speaker out circuit for routing the signal to an external cab That means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the 65 inch internal speaker off or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal onePlugging phones into the headphone jack will NOT turn off the internal speaker You need to do that with the speaker switch Personally I love that feature because you can also use the phones jack as an output to a PA with the amps internal speaker still activeYou definitely need to follow the instruction manual and especially the advanced users guide or you may be initially disappointed My brother returned the first unit he purchased because there was a pop when it was turned on or off as well as a slight hum when it was idling The replacement amp exhibited the same problems However if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems I mentioned quirks the power on and off procedure and positioning the gain knob to the mid level are the keys to smoothing the amp outBottom line this tiny amp packs a punch and has sound characteristics that have to be heard to believe If you want true reverb you will need to plug in a pedal check out theBoss FRV1 63 Fender Reverb Pedalif you havent already but for small venues and practice rooms the ambiance feature is probably all you need Do take the time to read the documentation before you start using it because when this amp is properly used its simply amazing Will fill a room but has some quirks,positive
exactly what I was looking for A Jazz III sized pick smaller than a commonsized guitar pick that works better for me because the grip nubs make it easier to keep it in the proper angleposition guitar pick w extruded grip nubs,positive
I bought this along with a Clayton large glass slide Well the Clayton was very thin walled and didnt even fit over my ring finger knuckle This slide is very thick and works great Great Slide large does fit large fingers,positive
Been playing for 30 years and I have used tube screamers extensively As some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about It is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components Most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over 30 dollars Are there better tube screamer clones out there Probably but for the price you will not find a better unit Build sturdy I would gig with this without hesitationI hate to leave this review because I know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products Great pedal Great value tube screamer clone,positive
Im very happy with this pedal It seems to be a knock off of the MXR phase pedal being that it provides a nice classic subtle phase effect You can flip the switch to swirl for a more pronounced effect but I love just keeping it mildThe metal switchbutton to engage the pedal doesnt have the click that many pedals do I actually prefer this The click effects wear out sooner Some of my high end pedals also use this smooth clickless way of engaging a pedal Youll know its on by the tone change and the bright led light IMHO you dont need a click switchThe sounds are clean and smooth clear and bright and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effectQuality and Value all the way Nice tones subtle phase similar to MXR,positive
This is good for now Keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking For the money it works Recommend this product This is good for now,positive

Fit my MIM strat perfectly not much else to say Always buy Fender parts for Fender guitars dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay they wont fit Just what I needed,positive
It only cost around 20 so my expectations werent very high to begin with but right out of the box it had a hole in the stitching and the front pocket was sown on crooked I dont plan on keeping it long You get what you pay for,neutral
Snark tuners are the best A few months ago I bought a different brand tuner and it doesnt pick up all strings I bought this one and it works great No problems Great,positive
I ordered the Hola and the Snark SN6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church Ive spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to 34settle in34 Ive used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent I cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one They are both contact tuners meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphoneThe Hola is definitely the best choice of the two in that its more versatile easier to use more durable looking and easier to store The Hola lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need The Snarks curved display arm which you cant really see in the photo is slightly more delicate looking in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther I found the Hola display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read Honestly most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are The really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the HolaHola offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function You can select 34chromatic34 34guitar34 34bass34 and 34ukulele34 modes by briefly pressing the power button as opposed to a longpress for power onoff This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician Imagine trying to tune with a an 88key piano if you dont know anything about the notes on the piano 34Ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes Use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instrumentsThe snark is superior in its rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction If turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the Snark I found the Holas display to be more than sufficient Im currently using the snark on my guitar Works great Big display small enough for your bag,positive
The capo is pretty good I like the ability to customize tension However it is unclear which way the capo should be put on with the 34pincer34 side facing the floor or facing the ceiling In either direction its a bit awkward to put ontake off as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly The Kaiser is still the best IMO but you cant adjust the tension on those Overall this is good but not great Pretty good,positive
This gig bag is well worth the price It replaced the cheesy gig back I received with my soprano ukulele and I have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now It has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends Get this gig bag Lanikai Gig Bag,positive
What great idea to put all three tools needed when changing strings into one tool The cutter even works well Neat tool,positive
I have used Ernie Ball strings on my Les Paul for quite a while Slinkys mostly I recently bought a Yamaha FG700S and quickly found that the high E string had a very tinny tone I searched the net to see if this was comon with this model alas I found that it isSo I decided to try some different strings to see if it would help I ordered a set of Earthwood Lights and installed them last nightWow what a difference First the tone is much softer on the E string second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3 The strings that came on the guitar were Yamaha light strings but they were very stiff especially the B string After a hour of playing with the Earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable both tonally and physically Not sure how they will last time will tellGood strings I would recommend them Nice Tone,positive
This capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck for example a les paul or most acoustics For thinner necks like a strat or tele it works ok but has to be positioned just right to prevent string buzz Its not the ole clip it and go capo Im used to I bought this to have a capo I could just leave clipped on my acoustics head for use when needed No dice Neck too thick Its a Washburn dreadnaught Were not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitarBottom line Its cheap as dirt and you can make it work if you dont mind having to place it just right My advice spend a few bucks more and buy one thats easy Requires lots of fidgiting,neutral
All the parts I buy an Amazon have been checks out before I buy them and they have been compared with other companies and I found these parts are the best price and quality compared to other outlets I repair and rebuild guitars as a hobby and I am satisfied with these parts johnJ great parts,positive
this tuner is awsomeit tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner works great,positive
To everyone who plays flatpicking guitar Im sure you all have your own choice of pickdo you even remember why you picked the style you use Somehow I started out with Fender thins and here I remain Just what I needed,positive
I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them They could have been a litte taller howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra I would buy more if I needed them Good Stands for the Money,positive
Having bought 4 sizes of Ukulele only to discover the Baritone Uku is much like a classical guitars lower 4 strings I was curious for 60 bucks to see what it is like to play the Mandolin If you are interested in this style of play search You Tube videos and watch people I have not found anyone cutting Hotel California out on these thingsI also didnt feel like I wanted to learn yet another chord set tried playing the electric guitar even going and getting Rocksmith software to learn which is prety cool anyhow I changed the strings on the Baritone to be a ukuleleso this Mandolin has a very thin neck Maybe 125 width I have watched videos of other people playing and their necks look wider this is hard to fat finger yea I have fat fingersMy initial problem is this thing doesnt come delivered anywhere close to ready to go the Saddle moves is not hard mounted and has height adjustersso once I figured that out and also put some 3 in 1 oil on the nut so when tuning the strings dont drag whether this is right or wrong I dont know I did it regardlessI measured from the nut to the 12th fret then the 12th fret to the Saddle and moved the saddle so both measurements were really close if you are having tuning trouble withe yours I bet this is the problem with your Tuner set your strings Tight that was another problem this thing should twang high pitched like the dude in the Geico commericals Again on You tube someone posted videos of tuning I also read buy a very stiff pick not for me I guess I am not gentle and smashed the strings couldnt keep the pick in my fingers so I use a light one the grounds for using the stiff was the pick will not bend and create delay I guess between the two strings same note the light weight one works well for me when I do pick this thing up it is not hard to tune I use my Ukulele Snarks and pick one string at a time it is a cute guitar regardless and I saw one for sale Used at Guitar Center for 75 bucks same oneif you are someone who can play guitar this might be fun I suck at it I pretty much suck at Ukulele playing too but manage to play rock tunes that actually sound like somethingI might some day figure out how to tune it like a ukulele but you can play songs with three to four chords good luck Like not love,positive
The look of this strap caught my eye I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud Strong build sort of a double layered nylon strap and nice thick leather for the endsone end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new but it should be easier with some wear Easy to adjust comfortable I think that with many things you get what you pay for and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get Solid strap,positive
I have found the perfect strings and these are not themI will use these for my lower end stuff I will probably sell anyway We all have our preferences but Im not an Ernie Ball fan Theyre cheap though good string for cheap guitars,positive
very awesome item really useful for tuning havent had any problems with it at all so far Looks very nice awesome item,positive
This is a Palnet Waves and just as good as the more expensive onesMaterial is rougherbut thats a good thing Better Than price Reflects,positive
this piece of plastic is just terrible youd be better off with a couple of books and a towelnot recommended waste of money,negative
My Strat has bigger frets than any guitar I have ever owned and I have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges particularly on the 3rd string This 11 to 49 set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure while still feeling faster than an acoustic guitar They sound great last a long time stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets A great gauge for larger frets,positive
Ive read its not really complete isolated but it does the job I didnt realise how much noise my one spot was adding I AB them both one after the other and it truly was quieter the only Problem I have is my TC Helicon takes 12 volts input but 300MA this pedal only supplies 100MA so the pedal didnt work in the 12 volt slit Luckily however it does work plugged into the 9volt 300MA spot so im using it there everything else in the other 9volt 100MA slotsits a lot quieter now I recommend trying it and saving some cash I like it,positive
This Ultex Jazz 3 its very cool your durability is very high and Im feel very comfortable to play with it Great Picks,positive
My daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great Excellent price and product is as described and price was right Great strings,positive
They are not designed with a switch to have all lights on at the same time So if you need that sort of control on your lights this will not do it They are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice Wish it had a setting for turning all lights on at once,neutral
I know many people love the design but I find it much too frustrating You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly then snap it in then turn and turn the screw oops dont let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again What a farce This is the worst capo Ive owned and Ive tried nearly every brand and type Yeah Ive had people show me how to do it right and I know to do it right Its just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on snapping it screwing it in screwing it off having it fall off forget it its garbage to me Also while Im getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw Its actually slightly painful to the fingers momentarily but why have to deal with that to work with This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it The only good thing I can say about it is looks durableNo thanks Worst capo Ive ever used,negative
What can I say that has not been said about the other DRs that I have used They rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course If you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try DR Pure BluesI decided to use 9s on my Fender Tele hollowbody because the company puts 9s on their guitarsI didnt want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so I stuckwith the 9s Hey the Rev uses 7s size does not matter when it comes to strings and toneThe other reason for the Pure Nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from P90pick ups Pure Nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit One more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets which is a good thing Steel will wear down your frets a lot fasterI will say that my very first set of DR Pure Blues went bad after a few weeks The windings brokeon the Dstring at two places where the string fretted The reason I kept going back to DR Bluesis that I have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars 4 solid bodies another hollowbody since then Giving DR a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in 2010 was a flukeIf you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with DR Pure BluesAllegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone This is because prior to the mid40smost strings were made of nickel During WWII nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings Or so the historical theory goesGradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound To achieve the vintage tone I am sure you would alsoneed the right amp AND the right touch to get to that point I am not necessarily looking for avintage tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last Your exact mileagemay differI have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers The only time I get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board There is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much I wipethe fret board Definitely not the strings though I have also never heard any stringsqueak from thestrings that would give me pause either Any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally Withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high or the nut is not cut right or the wrong sizestring is used for the nutWell there you go what I have experienced with DR Pure Blues Nickel Wrap Round Core strings I willalso say that on guitar forums that I frequent more people are giving DR kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings So if you do get a bum string give them a holler Now get out thereand play your heart out Oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at itHave fun Same Old Same Old DR Pure Blues Nickel Wrap Round Core 942,positive
This passive DIbox is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input Some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation The 20db attenuation sounded funny but that is probably because I used the same equipment for all attenuation settings With each attenuation setting I had to adjust the input volume accordingly This device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops All the devices that I tried this with did not have their own internal grounding so I needed to have the ground come from the mixer I did get some hum when I would touch the case just like I did with other DIboxes This product worked very well for my needs ships mostly as expected,positive

I ordered these picks in bulk to use while I was recordingproducing I absolutely love these picks and swear by them Ive been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that I landed on years ago and stuck to Ive had years of lessons licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me Perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for Rhythms Id order again if I had to My favorite pick,positive
I bought this mixer in order to combine my bass guitar with an mp3 player for silent practice at home Bass into one channel iPod into another headphones outIt works There are other solutions to this dilemma Pocketsized headphone amps and so on But theyre a more expensive and b kind of junky and c come equipped with builtin effects and amp models which I do not want YMMVSo whats the Behringer XENYX 502 like in this use scenario1 The blue power light is blinding First thing I did was put some masking tape on it so that it didnt prevent me from seeing the knobs on the board2 Speaking of those knobs they seem a little rickety Be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly I worry that the knobs wont stand up to that kind of treatment for long3 Theres no onoff switch so youll wind up pulling the power out of the back of the unit when its not in use Strange for this particular usage scenarioOverall I think this unit is a great value for the money great for silent headphone guitar practice,positive
This is just your typical nylon strap a bit stiff but durable I love the Celtic design enough to use this strap but ordinarily I prefer higher quality materials than the nylon and plastic construction with leather ends The leather is also a bit stiff but not so stiff that its not functional or reliable If Dunlop made this in cotton and steel Id pay 4x as much for it Design great material meh,neutral
I use this with my mobile DJ equipment and it is fantastic Very sturdy and light enough to easily carry Holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation Plastic covers on the feet came off right away though but not really a big deal to me Great,positive
Sounds like my original Enough said Great pedal and it is still built like a tank I do appreciate that on this version one can use a pretty standard AC adapter A It Cries,positive
Bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar Suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding and to have the padded area longer Not bad,positive
I bought 6 of these XLR to 1434 adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer I owned with 1434 inputs It didnt end up working because I discovered I needed to convert the microphone level to line level which these dont do however they do convert XLR to 1434 balanced quite well Just not what I needed in my particular situation Nice tool although not a transformer balancing device,positive
The tuner workss as advertised When I attached my guitar to a Boss Chromatic and clipped on the Snark it was spot on For 10 which is also half the price at your local guitar shops The product works as advertised and Amazon has the best deal GREAT VALUE,positive
The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories It does include a lock on the middle latch but somehow mine eventually stopped working as the lock isnt very good quality The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used Otherwise great case highly recommended Very nice case,positive
Very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picksOnly thing I can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of itIt does help to have a few stowed away for when you need themI was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to meIt seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor I ordered the product fromDunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar playersThey have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usuallyThis product AS ADVERTISED DID NOT come with any picksIf you order this and need picks MAKE SURE YOU ORDER PICKS SEPARATELY Great product,positive
If you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp drop one of these in the V1 position the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier Easy to do and youll notice an immediate increase in distortionPlaced one in a Fender Blues Junior Before when the master was down and the preampvolume was all the way up I could barely get some overdrive Afterwards it had plenty Night and Day differenceGood sound too Not harsh adds harmonics Very lush sounding Tung Sol knows how to do it Excellent High Gain,positive
I got this at a great price so decided to give a strobe tuner a try If youre accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it While it may technically be more accurate than the cheaper vibration tuners this advantage is of limited use given that the tuning of guitars still has to have some compromise from perfect in order to be well intonated One advantage over the clip on tuners by the way you cant beat Snarks for the price is that because it is electronically connected to the guitar it is not affected but other instruments that may be playing at the same time Ive noticed that while trying to tune when playing live by clip on tuner seemed to get 34confused34 by other instruments Takes some getting used to,positive
The chorus effect is a little weak I use it now to get sort of a leslie effect Clean the effect is a little weak The adjustment knobs dont seem to do much either This is just okay,neutral
I really like this one as a pre to my Fender Superchamp X2 head especially on the distortion channel It really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a HUGE sweeping circuit I was not able to get it even close to 12 way without it being just ugly but that might be preference Also of note is that I ran my Fender Mustang bass guitar through this active pickups and I loved the grit that it gave the sound This is a great pedal for the and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand Very nice work Joyo I will be buying more of your pedals for sure Nice fat overdrive,positive
I bought a couple of these two years ago They are a sturdy but lightweight stand The small footprint is nice for those with limited space I use for both electric and acoustic guitars I will say that the two I recently purchased are NOT the same as the ones purchased in 2011 The pictured product is the same but the actual product is not The newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model The tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support The body support now inserts through the base tube the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece The rubber feet are also smaller These changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable however I believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars I didnt notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported There may be a concern about damage to certain finish I would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material Good little stand,positive
Not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well I have a ton because I keep one on the end of each guitar Furthermore they are very accurate as well SO worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time I want to change tuningsBottom line Inexpensive wellmade accurate timesaving Buy it now I have over 10 theyre great,positive
I have two of these They hold a variety of guitars just fineSince the blocks are square make sure you get them aligned with a wall or ceiling so they dont look crooked They seem to come from a variety of wood mine are not a matched set even though I ordered two of the same part They have different wood grains Holds my guitar just fine,positive
I bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there or across town Its a decent build quality but I wouldnt feel comfortable assigning it to gig duty Its got a fair amount of padding and a nice storage array but once again I personally feel this bag is more suited for a 12 mile trip to practice or lessons Good For Casual Use But Wouldnt Use For Gigging,positive
I use these on my acoustic Washburn and they stay bright for weeks I have been playing guitar for 30 years and these are the best Best strings ever,positive
I currenty use two types of capos the Kyser one and Shubb capos Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknessesThe benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo Ive come across doesnt require tension adjustment and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension and second its smallerThe main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension Because its designed to work across the fretboard it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets causing frets to wear faster over time Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby Quickest changing capo,positive
I like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments I run this through a Furman pedal board and there is little to no noise for the money this is a good product Awesome for fine tuning my tone,positive
I absolutely LOVE these picks Grips really well in your hand plays like a dream I just wish more came in the pack I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks Love the design and how it plays,positive
What more can I say These strings sound GREAT They play wonderfully work well together have a nice brilliant but not tinny sound and are excellently made These are not going to unwind on you or break easilyExcellent Thats all there is to say about it Brilliant wellmade easy to use great sounding strings,positive
I you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand This is it Tripod legs are stable and also adjusts up and down to about 15 inches or soIt even comes with a case with two zippered sections One for the stand and and one for a mic There is also amic holder What a find I will probably get another What a find,positive
The price is fair and it serves its purpose Im pretty happy with this cloth I just wish it was bigger so I could have a greater surface area of the cloth to use before washing it I havent had to wash it yet but it looks like it would hold up Pretty good,positive
This is without a doubt the best guitar tuner I have ever used I have been playing for years and have owned many tuners this one is the best and I purchased it at a better price than it was offered at my local music store Customer comments,positive
Right out of the box playable I did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime The electronics are just fine on the guitar I got I did have to adjust the string action down a bit but hey that goes with the territory There were some minor flaws in the finish but for the money spent this is a real workhorse and plays great Excellent value,positive
Im so glad I was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago Its cheap yet works better than most tuners that require a plug in that end up costing around slightly more Its been awhile since Ive had it and still have no complaints or issues with it I wholeheartedly recommend this just YES,positive
I use this to patch in four ports from aBBE DI400 4 Channel Active Direct Box Direct Injection DI Boxand two from anAlesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifierinto a mixer First the size is perfect in my rack configuration The cables easily reach and the color coding makes it a snap to see at a glance what is connected to what That is a great improvement over tags and labels that require you to get close to readWhat makes these a bargain is construction The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages However its the attention to small construction details that I love The XLR ends are quality components but cheap ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable which will often occur at cable ends on cables without themOverall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent setup and teardown and is built to last If you are shopping for patch cables in this size these are a great value in my opinion because you will probably not have to replace them for years Extremely well made,positive
A nice little untreated cloth to clean my Taylor guitarNow if I could only play the guitar as well as this cloth cleans it 0 Good for the price,positive
Ive used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars They definitely look great but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so Thats my experience at least These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people but they are wonderful I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out Ive had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and its easiest just to buy a new one Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players The best capo Ive ever used,positive
i dont know much about delay and Ive never really used it This is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay Kinda makes you aware of what you are playing Fun with blueschorus sound Yep cool,positive
I was at Guitar Center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased Ibanez EW20ASENT Acoustic Guitar which is virtually identical to theIbanez EW20ZWENT Exotic Woods Series Zebrawood Acoustic Electric Cutaway Guitar but everything they had in stock was a bit too small Ive been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase Turns out I have the Dreadnought variety which is a bit larger This Fender bag received some great reviews but I was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions werent correct I couldnt find ANY info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag so I took the leap and Im so glad I did Bag is not too snug not too loose and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps Great padding yet still lightweight And a great price And it arrived a day early sweet Ibanez EW20 body not neck dimensions W 16 D 5 L 20 Thank you Amazon Fender Large Dreadnought Size for Ibanez EW20 Series,positive
Wow for the size this is amazing Plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper Nothing else to say its great if youre in the market for one get it Great,positive
I bought this boost to use in one specific situation When playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down my volume drops quite dramatically This boost does what it says it will do to remedy that but it also seems to add a lot of noise When the boost is off my super high gain Fryette Deliverance 120 is very quiet when I just hold my hand over the strings Im using a 2010 LP Custom with a stock 490R pick up in the neck and 498T in the bridge When I turn on the boost I immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise When playing it isnt so bad but I definitely am not used to so much extra noise There are a couple of adjustment switches inside and I havent fooled with those yet but Im definitely going to do that This boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound but if youve already got pro quality stuff I dont see too much of an advantage here Works but seems noisy,neutral
Other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50150 and more I just wanted a decent simple pedal that could be used on occasion with my garage band buddies This is perfect Ive only used a few times so I cant testify to the durabilty but it sounds great Does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal Great for the money,positive
I put these on a Parker Great that they have uniform tension Took a bit to get used to but they are very playable vlues rock country Nice strings Great strings for consistant bending,positive
The padding is comfortable but slightly heavy Velcro flaps make installation easy The only thing I do not like is that it is prone to slide around on my nylon strap I will probably use double sided tape to attach it to the strap I feel they should ave designed the inner flap with something less slippery Works pretty well,positive
Im not one to use picks much so when I do I prefer a light pick I will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because 25 will last a very long time It is fun to share For those needing a light pick go for these Recommended Great price for this light picks,positive
These perform well on single coils specifically Telecasters Right now I switch back and forth between Power and Beefy with Fenders being my next choice followed by DAddario A good allaround set,positive
I bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag I know it says tenor now that I look at it but since I put soprano gig bag into the amazon search I figured I would be getting only soprano bags Anyway it doesnt seem much more then a normal gig bag Yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not Not sure how well it holds a tenor since I dont have one Mine is black not the almost purple the image shows Acciedent,neutral

Good inexpensive microphone cable Even came with a couple of Velcro straps The ends seem to be well made Dont hear any anomalies in the audio Its a cable,positive
once i used these picks for the first time i never could use different picks ever again and its a great price BUY THEM Greatest picks ever,positive
Purchased after another folding stand which cost the same literally fell apart This one is much better although not quite as portable On the plus side music stays put on this one its very stable and the height is fully adjustable You can buy with confidence Heavy Duty,positive
Really satisfied with the chair I cannot explain how cool this chair is Very glad I got it definitely worth the price for the great overall value that this chair really gives you This is The Chair That Professionals Use,positive
You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filterOn this model the top filter part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tubeDespite this the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively goodIn all honesty Buy a nicer filter or none at all They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless youre using Topoftheline microphones If this is the case spend the money to get a nicer filterOne nice thing these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them I found that quality nice when dealing with passionate vocalists Cheap surprisingly sturdy,neutral
Elderly pickers like me fumble conventional picks onto the floor particularly when the skin is dry during winter The grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that The material used for the core gives a slightly softer tone than the Fender mediums I have used for 50 years I like the graduated feel these picks have with a slight give in the center allowing the player to vary the pick attack between strumming and picking single notes A giant leap for guitar picks,positive
I got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail Saves some money on replacementsI found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so I like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings I use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning Good Product,positive
believe it or not Ive been putting off buying one Im so glad i got it now I love looking at my guitar in this thing and now I even want to pick the guitar up more than ever Id have to say im happy with the quality cant see anything to complain about really just what i need,positive
Same kind that come on all guitars from the Fender factory Classic sound I have switched to DAddarios to capture that Frusciante sound Good Factory Replacements,positive
The item shipped in time It is working fine The sound is very good The only problem I had is voltage I live in Europe and I had to buy special adapter which transforms 220 volts to 120I know A lot of items from USA that work with both voltage 220 and 110 but not this oneThanks anyway exelent,positive
In my opinion Snark makes the best tuners in the 10 to 20 dollar price range This particular model has a metronome built in to it the metros options are a bit limited and the beat can be lost if you are in a noisy environment but for the price I consider I bought a tuner with a freebie built inThe tuner obviously works on mic alone so if the noise level gets too high or the note too soft it doesnt register but for my use holding my fakebook open while I play mando and harmonica it works well For the price snark tuners cant be beat,positive
Replacing your pickguard Lost a screw Authentic replacement screws if you need them I ordered these with a new pickguard for my Strat in case I lost or boogered up one of the screws Exactly like stock screws Bright screws,positive
I play and teach classical guitar and needed a good digital recorder with which to record myself and my students and also be able to convert to mp3 format to upload to the internet Ive recorded several solo pieces and it does pick up the guitar very well including all string squeaks and fret buzzes darn it So it will force you to clean up your playing a bit If you are a musician and want a recorder that is very portable and relatively easy to use then this little gadget is quite good It wont give you recording studio quality but you can clearly hear the deep tones of a classical guitar and no hiss or background noise unless you have bigmouthed birds like I do so youre recording is very clearWhen I get ready to record I set the gain as described in the manual then set the recorder on my music stand and begin playing Since I bought the 4G card I can play the piece as many times as I need too in a row without worrying about it running out of memory just as I finally play the piece to my specifications Also if you connect the H2 to an electrical outlet and not rely on the batteries that is one less worry Your H2 wont die during recording because the batteries give outI cant really tell any difference in the recording quality with or without the wind sock that came with it It sounds the same I guess if I were a singer I would use it to screen out wind but a guitar doesnt really need it Yes the screen is very small and difficult to read I keep a magnifying glass handy but now Ive pretty much got the button pushing sequences memorized and dont need to use it as often to see the screen Also download a free editing program such as Audacity so you can convert your recordings to various formatsId give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial It seems fragile and I dropped it once but luckily it bounced off my foot which had a big fuzzy house shoe on it so it didnt break But it might have if I had not broken its fall And you will need a longer USB cord I cant believe the one they sent was so short But that is a very easy fix and overall this is one nice little tool And for the price Id buy it again UPDATE 22212Im still using the H2 Zoom on almost a daily basis to record my students playing and my own playing I still love it it works great and I feel I really purchased a great item H2 ZOOM,positive
Popped one of these into my Hartke LH500 Bass Head it it sounds greatthe stock tube was sounding a bit harsh and this one sounds a bit cleared and more definednice tube Super Tube,positive
This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though But maybe that saves on battery life I dont know It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breakingIm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitarbass and not the chromatic one Works,positive
Perhaps more than anything else it was the introduction and subsequent success of the Zoom H2 personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasiprofessionallevel recordings with their computers plus a minimum of userfriendly equipment at reasonable prices The price of the Samson Meteor USB mic a fairly recent entry has come down to the point of being fairly valued initially I was seeing it going for prices above the bettersounding Blue Yeti mic Its an attractive some would say cute little mic with its quaint retro design and deceptively foldup portable size I say deceptive because due to the nonadjustable mic stand it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop next to a computer and squarely in front of the narrators mouthBearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound its good but nowhere close to studioquality it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking high fidelity audio to spend the extra 20 for a Blue Yeti or an Audio Technica AT2020 USB as tempting as the lower price of the nonUSB version of the AT2020 is be sure to try it out with a preamp supplying phantom power before going that route Ive known a couple of individuals who ordered the AT2020 condenser mic only to discover that it was useless with a computer even with the addition of a Snake Light cableIf your primary considerations are convenience and portability the Samson Go mic sounds almost as good as the Meteor and is unmatched in size convenience and portability It scored higher than the Blue Mikey and Blue Snowflake in my auditions Im tempted to say its the perfect laptop mic clipping to the top cover more securely than the Snowflake whereas the Yeti is ideal for desktop use producing richsounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studios Shure SM7B mics Attractive cosmetics and good sound but not necessarily the best fit,positive
now it doesnt worksame day i got it In my control panel the mic is there but it doesnt pick up any sound Followed all the instructions emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been 34 days no answer Maybe im being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it If you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment Worked out of the box great,neutral
The mic is well made heavy on the 34mic34 end but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multitrack studio good mic,positive
I dont know why they are called big stubby They are on the small side Way to thick for me They do sound good though and will last a long time I feel like I am playing with a nickle I like the indentation Helps the grip a lot I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness Still looking for the right picks for me If these were slimmer and a bit larger I would buy again Stubby is right,neutral
First time Ive spent over 25 bucks for headphones Use for both reference with a GNX4 and guitar and easy listening Very accurate and no coloration of tone that I can detect semiaudiophileA bit bass heavy but overall great headphones very comfortable get hot to wear in the summer Great first decent pair of headphones,positive
I built a custom cabinet and installed this baby Boy does it crank Ive tried a couple different heads and they all sound great I play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine Sounds great,positive
I am not a giging muscian or even a serious player I play for fun and relaxation I have been playing for about 10 years but only in the past 2 years have I taken up the electric gutiar I have a very simple amp setup with a Fender Starcaster 15 G as my practice backup amp and a Fender Mustang 1 20watt as my main amp I love the Mustang but have always found the Starcaster kinda weak well duh it is a simple practice amp I have 2 very basic Guitars a Jay Turser M300 Series and an Epi LP Special II I normally only use the Mustang but latly have found myself really appreciating the simple clean sound that the Starcaster can give But it is a one hit wonder I am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome I order this pedal on a whim thinking that it might add a little depth the the starcaster and I might be more inclined to use this amp more Boy did I hit a home run with that The pedal arrived and I spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster The depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing It truely gives it a tube crunch but yet retains the nice clean sound when the levels are backed off Flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion MONSTER Yea I know I cant imagine what this pedal would do on a 34real34 amp I also found that Im getting better response with my guitar tone knob too THat was always an issue with this small amp the tone knob made very little difference Not anymore I can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again Yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people Just for S and Gs I plugged this into the Mustang set on Brittish 60s Red and turned the levels way down Amazingly it backed the crunch and distortion way off from this setting so now I can go clean without having to touch the amp All the reviews have stated how nicely this pedal works on the upper settings but it was great to find out that it can be used effectively to clean up a dirty channel I look forward to playing with this some more on both ampsNo for the nuts and bolts of the thing Yup plastic Well Im very gentle on my gear this sits on a table next to me and is activated with my hand so I dont expect issues but if I was a thrash metal rocker I would probably look elsewhere for durability Dont drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime The switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate No issues there The dials are easy to read and turn smoothly The LED is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker Im using the AC adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement THe box is heavy enough to stay in place but lite enough that I could easily toss it in a gig bag and not worry about it damaging a guitar Cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime I left the unit plugged in overnight and there was no desernable heat in either the adaptor or the pedal after palying for an hour the pedal was still cool to the touch as was the adaptorMy biggest complaint has to do with Amazon itself I got this for twenty bucks shipped Amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive 10 Days Yea it was coming from Vegas to NY but 10 DAYS 15 Days later it finally arrived 15 DAYS More than 2 weeks Half a Month Im pretty sure UPS SurePost had a guy walk it to NY I dont know what the big delay was all about but I was horribly bummed about shipping times I ordered a few other items with this AC adaptor and 5 ft insutment cable to use with this and they arrived 4 days laterAll in all this is a great pedal Outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget If you have a simple practice amp and want more out of it then grab one of these pedals and be prepared for amazment that so much sound can come from a little package My first Pedal,positive
I ordered these for a Gibson Songwriter Deluxe EC Custom Vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a microtouch longer than the stock pins from GibsonThe pins measure 28mm or 1 14 inches in lengthI was going to return them but figured I would try them out in my Gibson Blues King L00 parlor sized guitarIt was about the same result a little too thin smaller heads and slightly longer but I went ahead and tried themGLAD I DIDI didnt think that after using the Tusq bridge that came stock from Gibson it would make any detectable difference but I was wrong I CAN tell a slight difference I did not remove the strings just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it which were fresh from yesterdayA small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeableThey also provide a graph in the packaging info but I think that it was a test using BOTH the TUSQ pins AND replacement saddle If you havent changed your saddledo it now and get rid of that soft plastic oneI must admit I did order these with about 75 of dressing up the guitar in mind and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected I got bothWhite with Paua Dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy I was seeking although there is no care taken as to match the dots for consistency they will vary in appearanceThe TUSQ Pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the wayright away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar The heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the Gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher and I do wish that the TUSQ pins were the same sizeI will see how well they do on the Blues King and most likely will order new pins for the Songwriter Deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two I dont expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashionIf in doubt consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the tone you have in mind be it darker brighter softer louder etc Strings make a big difference and I find using DAddario phosphor bronze strings very bright ringy last long are affordable and seem noticeably louder than GHS or Ernie Ball steel strings only does not apply to nylon or gut stringsOnce again if you have a plastic saddle andor nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable differencethen again they might make all the difference in the world You just have to try them and seeThey are inexpensive and prettywell worth the risk Slight Improvement Nice Aesthetics,positive

It sounds like its Behringer Very fake cheap sounding phaser but its all I need I got it mostly for that big airplane woosh and running it in the loop it does that fine The highs are kind of harsh but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame Its Behringer,neutral
I just received my Blue Radius Shock Mount and I was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit It reminds me a set piece from Fritz Langs Metropolis the rings around Saturn or something built by Tesla Its a beautiful thing certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded Certainly beats the homemade 4 inch PVC pipe and bungee cord shock mount I previously had made and my Yeti mounted to What is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the Yetis 3 knobs mute switch and USBHeadphone plugs on the bottom of the mic whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access Once you screw the Yeti into the machined shock mount base there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position say a guest speaker with great ease The build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws The elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room as they do on most shock mounts because they are not threaded on hooks but securely fastened to brackets then the holding screws The Radius also allows you to mount the Yeti on a boom stand upside down which I have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture spit does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics it just falls as gravity allowsDoes a shock mount make a difference in sound To my ears yes especially if you are recording into say a laptop on a table the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum Although the mic stand the Yeti comes with does an OK job of dampening vibration it is not going to give you as much isolation as the Radius which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up There is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments rooms or cabs vibrating your stands thats why you see most professional studios using shock mounts you just get a cleaner sound In a test the Radius works like a charm even from pounding on my mixing desk A 90 earthquake is not going to cause any vibrationOn the down side just to play Devils Advocate The Radius is huge and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability That said the Yeti is also a big microphone and once mounted may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly Next when you un mount the Yeti from its built in stand you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic I fixed that by screwing the old Yeti stand screws back into the holes which actually looks kind of neat to me To some maybe it will look like bolts in the Frankenstein Monsters neck but I think it all fits together Next smaller base microphone stands will want to tip either angle the Yeti plus Radius back or get a bigger stand this is the one I have and would highly reccomend theSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand Lastly this mount will only work as far as I can see with a Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro microphone maybe some other mics will work but not likelyIn conclusion the Radius is an easy set up works great and makes a Yeti look retrofuturistic sexy Yeah it actually looks really cool like a spaceship blasting off or landing take your pick I know people coming into my studio are going to say What The heck is that and where can I get one I may tease and say its and award or art pieceAddendum 12132011If you thread another shock mount into the Radius you get double protection It also looks great to talent in your studio Over Kill or Uber Cool you decide See Pictures Blue Builds Another Beauty,positive
wow for the price u can not beat this pedal i got this pedal to add a second guitar harmony to some of my songs wow it sounds awesome probably the only note here is that when activate it i noticed that kinda lower the volume a little bit i do not mind though and still give it 5 stars awesome pedal,positive

The Little Big Muff does one thing spectacularly well it delivers massive fuzzplussustain For that purpose its excellent both in sound and construction it feels like a metal brick However be warned if youre looking for a standard distortion pedal this is not it Its a fuzz pedal It delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal like say a BOSS DS1 If a great fuzz pedal is what you want this is a superb choiceand so far as I know the best one for its price If the price is still too much for you consider the ModTone Fuzzer which is about as good but substantially cheaper at least as I write this Excellent,positive
You should find another review from me but suffice it to say I just wont skimp on my cables when I spend 1000s on amps and cabinets for good sound NOT MY FIRST NOR MY LAST,positive
I also own an Olympus LS10 This gives me the same recording ability 9624 but it is much less expensive You do get the ability to record with four channels which I am dying to try once I get my hands on 51 encoding software Also nice and not included with other brands A tripod to hold the unit a handle to use the unit like a microphone charger and earbudsSome have noted the zoom doesnt have speakers built in If you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it You need monitors or quality headphones I find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environmentsAs I said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material Olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls This may be a big issue if you dont treat your equipment carefully Time will tell but I have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the moneyI am also looking at the Zoom H1 which will come out in Sept 2010 This product may actually be the LS10 killer Materials are the tradeoff for great price and performance,positive
I own three units capable of tremolo Boss TR2 Line 6 MM4 and the Boss SL20 Slicer like a tremolo on steroids Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo If you are unfamiliar tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidlyThe Boss TR2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate with three controls Rate of modulation Depth of modulation how much does the volume vary and a Wave shape jagged square or somewhere on a continuum in between Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own CE5 PH3 the TR2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like youre playing in a fishbowl as another reviewer puts itThe Wave control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility so it is a nice feature to have Most tremolos have it but not all For the price it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on Guerilla Radio and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths How Soon Is Now I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations onoff over the course of a song rather than leave them on full timeLike all Boss stuff the box is sturdy and I like their big quiet footswitches over any of the little clicky ones on other units The color is a sort of a dull military dark green not the most attractive thing but not bad eitherThe small Boss effects do not come with a power cable so you will have to factor that into the cost Boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter but I dont know anyone who says this is a must I run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine If it didnt I would not buy Boss product periodBottom Line1 Gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds nothing crazy2 Not a bad price factor in a power cable3 Simple to operate4 Nice casing and footswitch drab color Nice Basic Tremolo Sounds,positive
Since I paid about 13 for this I was not expecting a great deal What I received was a decent enough floor switch for a Fender Mustang I or II It works well as a way to switch between two userdetermined presets on my Mustang II Construction is about as good as I would normally get on a 13 item It would be nice if the switch design allowed greater flexibility but thats a function of the Mustsng II design overall Im not grading the switch on thatIf you have a compatible Fender amp and can get this for less than 15 then its a good deal If prices go above that best to wait it out or check the pricing of used units on the Amazon Marketplace Suitable for light duty,positive
I have reviewed these strings before and frankly I wasnt all that impressed with the tone the first time around I think they feel great on the fingertips and theyre very playable especially for a picker but I just wasnt sold on the tone To be fair I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars and found them lacking There seemed to be a dropff in tone when switching from my usual strings Martin SPs to theseSo this time I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar I have a Yairi Alvarez AY20 which is a 000 sized guitar and they sound terrific Im no engineer or physicist so I really cant explain the mechanics of it all but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body and they produce a very clear bright tone across the higher range and hold their own on the low rangeI still dont think theyre the best thing since sliced bread and I still think theyre a bit overpriced but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect This seems to have no effect on the tone but for what these cost youd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months I play daily for at least 30 minutes a dayOverall these are good but overpriced strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars Youll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them and which dont In my experience large body guitars lose tone but they sound great on a smaller body These sound great on some guitars not so great on others,positive

Stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal I read the reviews and decided to give it a chance how could I lose at this price I put it in my cart and continued shoppingGuess whatthe reviewers werent lying except that one guy who gave it a 2what a BS reviewIt arrived today and I decided to give it a quick workout I grabbed a small amp Fender Frontman 15 and plugged in my Strat with a Seymour Duncan Hotrail at the bridge and gave it a go The quick workout turned into an hour long jam session as I got caught up in what this pedal can do It turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather With the mic at off X middle set at Hot and California and 34 gainthis thing just SCREAMS for solos and is very heavy for rhythm I spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing awayThe Tweed and Brit settings were great too as I tweaked a multitude of tones from this beast Ive had Behringer pedals before and even though they were decent vintage delay slow motion compressor eq I didnt get excited about them In fact I sold the delay and slow mo recently This pedal however is going to get some serious use Im not crazy about the plastic casing but it seems sturdy enough I cant recommend this pedal enoughthe reviews were right You wont be sorry Wish Id found this sooner,positive
Very pleasantly surprised buy this one I like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put It looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well A nice strap for my lower tier guitars great strap for the price,positive
I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadnt The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes but oh well Now on to the guitar itselfThis was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isnt a professional musician I still want to sound like one The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson Awesome crunch and great sustainability I can take or leave the kill pot The electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing Im not complaining I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups For 169 you cant expect to have the top of the lineTo sum it up I love this guitar I keep in E flat tuning and it stays To me a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop its tuning a little Amazing sound for under 200,positive
They are grovers They keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock I like the vintage look of these and they go great with my Gibson custom SG I have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars Grovers FTW,positive
I borrowed a friends MXR to try and liked the added sounds it gave me It filled a hole that was missing since 80 of my board is Behringer pedals I looked at Behringer first and was delighted when I found the PH9 Classic 90 Side by side with the MXR there wasnt a hole lot of difference and with the Behringers added swirl switch gives you a few more options It also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize Behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals Ive read a ton of reviews and still havent heard of one breaking because of the plastic As far as value to money spent This pedal is again at the top of the list Oh It also sounds great adding a phase shifter to my pedal board,positive
Spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth Shines nice and doesnt leave it feeling oilysticky Smells nice and makes your guitar looking new Does the job and pretty well too,positive
My reviews for this have changed a few times but no more When I first got it I liked the sound though it did sound a little cold and digital and this is from someone wanting to record shoegazedreampop which by its nature is full of cold tones reverbchorusdelay shimmering a la cocteau twins chapterhouse lush so at first I thought it was great Then the fuse software was even cooler all this customizing the sound though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise awayAfter all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizzcracklehair its called a few things Go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogoogleThe thing happening with this amp I think is a few things Fender guitars sound best through it which is silly if you dont own a fender and I dont and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body unless I have a grand to pay for an older one Im not going to get a rinky dink one and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars firstso everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality Also playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer that may be fine for some younger folks but to a lot of people Ive read the complaints I was trying not to realize as I didnt feel like having to pay for shipping to return it BUT I DIDAnd I am so glad I did I almost got a peavey vypyr and I am glad I didnt This amp to be fair is really close to being really cool but that sound problem which I read on fenders own forumwebsite FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS sorry but thats some big company bsIve been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that and I was like what music snobs and what have you But I realized that Im a music snob I love the music I listen to more than anything and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didnt have that crackle sound but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return as after that it would have been finalThe decision I did make I think will be great for me as Id rather start with a good real tone then get the effects I need I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadnt played for more than a year or two or so saying throw away your pedals you wont need them and I was going to get pedals but dont need to now thats kind of the danger of these amps they end up making everyone sound the same No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang it sounded the same but in a different costumeI think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and Ive seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years maybe thats for them but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best most real tone possible so that means tube ampI think if I played this at a GC I wouldnt of gotten it and I just tried to make myself like it this amp is oooookay fizzlecrackle and noise when you arent playing,negative

These Martin strings M170 arent bad They just are not the sound I was looking for I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead The Martins are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball Other people will love them though They are easy to play not my taste,positive
this stand i very good just wish it was a bit heavier for helping it be more stable when using a heavy mic good stand,positive
Needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget I have owned multiple Behringer products and trust the brand It is a plastic casing but I dont tour so that wont be a problem I needed the effect and it gives it Fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume Dont spend 200 on a boutique pedal get this one Dig it,positive

I purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and kicking the tires of this one and its competition I will tell you up front my decision to buy the DR07MKII over the Zoom H1 came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer Im a musician and a wannabe videographer since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test I read about DR07MKII vs Zoom H1 and listened too on YouTube I decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same sizeMost reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians Tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between 150200 and dont even have high quality microphones so discovering I could toss an MP3 of the song I was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise This is the better choice for musiciansOther features I appreciate about the DR07MKII the adjustable microphones quick turn on and being armed to record the file system the low battery consumptionI should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record after all everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up power it up and start recording Well I got a recording without sound The unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero Once I figure that out all was right again in my universe You will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation I found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing The more aggressive recording level solved that problemI purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process I have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results I still dont know how I will solve the wind noise issue when recording ambient sound microphone capsules facing out since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the XY pattern position Im sure someone makes the smaller windscreen thoughFor my video work I use inexpensive hd capable camcorders My new fascination is with the Song Bloggie swivel camera lense they are inexpensive now 50 on Craigslist these days and with the DR07MKII all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality I get from the BloggieOne last detail at the point of purchase I discovered Amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the DR07MKII to the same price point as the Zoom H1 win win I got what I expected with my purchase you will too As expected is a good thing,positive

I really like this tuner it works very well once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner ie the moving black squares to no longer move then tuning is a simple and accurate thing it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it it cause a few bucks but I think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons that it is worth it Great you will never go back to the other type of tuner,positive
You get what you pay for This is a nononsense cheap guitar stand Its adjustable padded and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you a stage groupie or your clumsy drummer trip on it the whole mess falls over This is perfect for your Fender Starcaster or screaming pink Hello Kitty guitar This is not a good choice for your prized 1968 Jimi Hendrix Strat or 1964 Eric Clapton Gibson ES335 You might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those Does what it is supposed to but dont expect the world from it,neutral
I bought the TS version of these cables and they have served me well These are of the same quality and a great value for the price Awesome,positive

Very playable right out of the Box and very beautiful I have a Epiphone Swingster Nighthawk and Violin Bass and they are all great products I decided to give it a good set up After the Strings were off I sanded down the Bridge 12 mm and adjusted the neck just a little Then I want to really recommend Martin Bronze Strings light or extra light green box for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on 12 Strings Instructional videos can be viewed on YouTube before you go for it or you get a Guitar Tech to do itPs Matching Epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an Amp or line in recordingPs The Tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner Very nice Instrument I can recommend it,positive
Is the the best pedal ever Not even close Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slapback echoreverb to do Absolutely I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound It can give you a decently wet surfish sound or a fast delay rockabilly sound Its not super versatile but if youre looking for a little depth and color for under 20 then this is what you needI mean COME ON It works its cheap and it doesnt take up much room on your pedal board Price is no reflection of quality for this little guy,positive
I have been using this Preamp for a year and it has been great After I figured out that you have to attach a ground cable to the record player it installed very easily just plug it in and it plays I have not noticed any excess heat or other problems even though I keep it inside of my closed entertainment stand Great preamp,positive
I bought this guitar case for wife as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her 34GIG bag soft case with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could She absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it it makes you think that this case should cost more but for the 60 it is an awesome dealThe case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her Mic cable DI box picks and tuner Underneath the neck there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings You might pay more for a NAME brand casesave some money for soemthing else an dget this case because it is a great deal We found nothing negative that we could say about it It also was packaged VERY well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick Wonderful Case,positive

Ive used these strings longer than any other strings Ive tried about 7 years Last year I switched to DAddario EXP16s because they sounded better on the guitar I have now but still keep a pack of Nanowebs as a backup Here are my pros and cons of this stringProsEasier to fret and play than other strings I dont know why I looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings But they certainly are easier to fret press down and play than any other string Ive tried including other coated ones The coating on the Nanoweb strings is thinner than the Elixir Polyweb series but still feel very smooth and even slippery as some people remarked They have very little string squeakLast longer than any other strings Ive tried maybe because of their brightness these strings mellow with age as all strings do but never really sound dull The only reason I saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke usually every few months of regular playingVery bright sound which cuts through well playing live with a full band and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars However this can also be a con see belowConsCost more than most strings including other coated stringsCan sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well For this reason I switched to the EXP16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar The EXP16 is coated but has a more naturaldark sound that complements the woodiness of the guitar better than the Elixirs although not as easy to playNot available for export outside the US When I was working abroad I used to buy these from a US company who would ship them to me Elixir changed their policy to prevent this so I ended up switching strings because the cost of Elixirs abroad was so high Bright sounding strings that are kind to fingertips,positive

Indeed this little bluelighted wonder will make you famous Not unlike the 34Three Wolf Moon34 shirt this little pedal will get you the ladies or if youre a lady it will likely get you the guys Either way it gets you what you want On top of that it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of 34oomph34 In particular I find it helpful when Im running a lower output guitar through a long cable Did I mention it has a blue light The only downside is that you have to open up the back with a screwdriver so put that on your shopping list if you dont have one to adjust the little switches that chance the tone Yup does what it says and will make you a rock star,positive
I use these on my Fender Strat and they sound great If you appreciate the talent of David Gilmour and respect his taste and choices in music than I would recommend these strings I used to use Elixir strings and as great as Elixir sound they do not last long These do I have played guitar for over 30 years and I am very happy with these strings Yes,positive
I use this with fairly light mics seeNady DMK5 Drum Mic Packagefor detailsWhile I generally do not mic bass drums when I do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks I place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back Since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hihat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great helpWhere the stand shines if micing amps Some small amps such as theFender Champion 600 Electric Guitar Amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor This stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height For larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need itMy use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps But for each this stand is excellent in my opinion With the mics I am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where I need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease Perfect for bass drums and amps,positive
The use of the device was moderately difficult The primary difficulty was in the how the users manual was written The information is not straight forth and the how to especially on setting up the device was severely lacking This left me to the old plug and chug method Once I figured out how to set it upI found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker The DR did sound better with ear buds but still was short of what I expected based on the reviews on Amazon and other websites The good things though is that it is light portable and the mics can be moved I wasnt expecting bose type of sound but I wasnt expecting to hear the tin man either Fell Short of My Expectations,neutral
Reverb effects are no cheap but I was on a budget so I got this particular one The balance between quality and price is good The depth of sound sounds great I love all the options you get with this pedal The package comes with a bunch of stickers which I thought was kind of cool Great sound,positive

I had been leery about leaving my Fender 5 string Custom Jazz bass on guitar stands until I met the Hercules GS414B The stand is built like a tank with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly My bass weighs about 95 pounds with the strap and with its long neck fits perfectly in the Hercules with the body of the bass resting wellbalanced against the padded legsThe design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and I experimented with trying to tip the bass over It will take more than an accident to tip the bass off its stand The selfclosing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlockThe lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism The lock releases by lifting the bass from the standMy only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism I would have preferred the stand being a more conservative all black I trust this stand with my Fender Custom Jazz Bass,positive
Ive just received my Mustang I and have spent an hour playing with it and the Fuse software This thing is outrageous for a practice amp and Ive never heard anything like it in its price class and size With a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system I think you could probably gig with this thing One feature in the Fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module post gain after the preamp This is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models In effect Fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain before the preamp like a normal stomp boxI dont know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the AxeFX and that costs about 20 times more Power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why were seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the Fender Champion 600 and Bugera V5 these days Their problem is that theyre pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes they dont have enough power for that so theyre really only good for overdriven sounds Not so the Mustang I I think Fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package This thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest It has the classic Fender sound and feel of many different Fender amps without the weight cost and tube replacement needs Whats not to like The best practice amp Ive ever played through,positive

I hadnt played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it Having had carpal tunnel surgery a few months ago and having small hands to begin with I started researching guitars with narrow necks The Jasmine by Takamine kept coming up and had really good reviews so I decided to give it a try buying the S34C Firstly it was delivered promptly as requested and arrived in pristine condition with some really nice strings It has a lovely honey gold finish on the front of the body which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place I really appreciate the cutaway How many high notes will I be hitting on this baby Who knows but it looks WAY cool LOL The craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb I wasnt too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering on it but finally figured out the lettering was just a sticker that could be easily removed And the soundjust lovely with that ringing tonality one would expect from a steel string guitar but with some lovely mellow tones where needed as well I am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is Im taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques Hey I dont expect to be a Leo Kottke or Martin Simpson anytime soon but Ive got something to shoot for and we all need a dream If youre looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price look no further Oh the reason why I only gave it four stars is cuz the neck really doesnt seem to be all that narrow after all But maybe its just my small kidlike hands Thumb to little finger I can barely reach an octave on piano And there ya go Terrific guitar,positive

This little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even Its 14 TS plug goes directly into your basss instrument cable jack and it has one 18 TRS output jack for your headphone plug But it also has a second 18 TRS input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp3 player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over playalongs or any such music source both directly into your headphonesIts onoff switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which I never use It has both gain and volume output controls and both work It also has a tone control but I cannot discern that it does anything Could be that I just have a defective sample but I dont care because the tone is fine just as it isOthers have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile and I dont argue with thatit does feel a bit thinly made and the 2xAAA battery door does seem weak But I just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag If the battery door eventually falls off Ill use duct tape and when this little thing completely wears out Ill buy another Its just too handy and easy to travel with not to ownand as I said it does the jobEDIT 20130407 Still working fine Small package does the job,positive
Purchased to provide professional level IO for recording from mixers etcWorks very well for that purpose also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphones The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book Inputs provide for microphonephantom powered or not instrument balanced line on TRS and balanced line on XLR connectorTested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed and dead silent Output of high quality material also sounds superb and compares well with other very high quality gear Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this crowded price pointThough lacking lots of the IO and routing options you get with more expensive units this device unlike most other products in this price range has a quality feel to its enclosure jacks and controls Drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanlyThe input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too hot the color changes briefly to red helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering in SW to adjust your levelsRe computers and drivers almost all the tests went well On two laptops running Windows 7 installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great One of these recorded perfectly also The other which has a core 2 duo processor FWIW had issues recording properly and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed and I tried them all this problem remained So for certain windows laptops you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout This issue is why four starts rather than fiveOn a happier note this interface instantly worked with absolutely no installation on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 1204 precise So for linux users this may be a very attractive optionLastly documentation and bundled software is light this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear guidance re best practices etcBut this is a nit overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily The best inexpensivesimple audio computer interface,positive

I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them I generally use a Dunlop 10m pick but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play This of course can be very annoying especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem They are easy to hold onto great for leads and because of the way they are shaped dont hang on to the strings like the regular picks do Great picks Definitely worth the little extra they cost Great pick for all types of rock playing,positive
I have had plenty of these Lots just snap apart in the back or dont even work properly when you try and tune them This one is spectacular It is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly Best Ive ever found so far in a tuner Best there is,positive

Ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars and a few electric Fender and Gibson units All good in their own respectI decided to treat myself to a Les Paul for my 58th birthday but not having the financial resources to buy a 300000 git I shopped and shopped Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP100It arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding It was even sorta in tune but a quick dialin with the electronic tuner brought that rightSimply put Nice guitar After allowing the strings and neck to settle in together I spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height intonation and pickup distances and now this LP ROCKS If youre going to spend midrange on a fine practice performance guitar you cant go wrong with this one kids Two Thumbs Up Suggestion A Fender Mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better A Very Good Selection,positive
They are and look the right size and fit the cover well a must when you want the right screw for the job thanks Thi look good,positive
Excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning Welldesigned and rugged construction I believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least 50 more Onebutton operation makes it simple to operate Korg Pitchblack True Bypass Chromatic Tuner Pedal with 4 Display Modes,positive

I really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use However it broke not too long after I bought it One of the connections broke that is I think they might have made it a little more durable since then Moreover I sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool It would be nice though not to have had to do that It broke but was replaced,positive
All I can say is You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 8020 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself You will not want to go back to any other set of strings Ive been using Elixir strings for many years They have better feel sound and last longer than all other brands Ive used playing Guitar Elixir has excellent quality control too Ive never had a problem Best Acoustic Guitar Strings,positive

I bought this cable long with my epiphone les paul special II and the Fender Mini Tone Master thinking that either one did not come with a cable The epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days The curly cable has fared much better No problems works great and doesnt tangle so it stores easily tooGreat as a primary or backup cable Buy one its cheap Great bargain what a steal,positive
Ive used these strings for quite a while now They have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity If youre looking for a good string that last a fair amount of time before dead string syndrome hits Id recommend these Love em,positive
Sound just like an Ibanez Tube Screamer to me Many seem to complain about the plastic housing but Im fine with it Seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so Sounds great but I also have a Berhinger Ultra Metal that I think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this Note I use it with a Marshall JMC800 head a Marshall JMP head and a Crate Blue Voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent Ive got some videos on YT if you search UM300 JMP800 and Blue Voodoo out Nice cheap Tube Scream I mean overdrive pedal,positive

These work just fine as replacement mounting screws for singlecoil pickups mounted to a pickguard though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker nothing that a little drilling out couldnt fix if youre so inclined Good for standard singlecoil pickups,positive
I love it It works great No ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested Its as easy as you plug it in andor flip a switch for the desired effect and voila it works So duh why do I need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject Just buy the product and get on with happy music making Thank you OnStage Does the Job,positive
Ive tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc but it was always awkward This bench with its thick padding and wide width allows me to practice playing the guitar and move around freely Honestly I even sat on the floor for a while but no matter what I did my legs would hurt I just wasnt at the right height This bench is adjustable and I was able to find a height so that I could practice for hours without putting a strain on my legs and back It was absolutely worth the small investment for me Great For Guitar Practicing Too,positive
its amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha while youre goin all out on pedals you can just use the dropclutch to make it sound like the hat is open OR closeddepends on what you want its really useful and I recommend it if you double pedal a lot DropClutch,positive

Plugged em in to my PAs Yamaha mixer and tried out my effects processor and they sound great Better than the Nady Starpower mic I also bought from Amazon These seem like they will last and I plan to buy these as long as they stay the same price Cant beat this deal,positive
I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps This requires of course the addition of a 14 inch adapter plug The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues RecommendedUPDATE I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty The set screw fell out and could not be found Ive had similar problems with other Pyle products If you buy them I recommend tat you get a microscrewdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience Works well with guitar amps if ou tighten the set screws,positive
Daddario makes a pretty good string but Id have to say I prefer the Elixir The sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with Elixir Dont get me wrong though I still like these If theres a sale Ill buy some more Good sound I prefer Elixir,positive
Ive used a variety of tuners When the Snark first came out the price was so low I thought it must not be that good However I borrowed one one time and ended up buying several What I like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display is seems to be very accurate the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough I have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners About the only thing that has been an issue is that on occation it wont register Turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem Also it may be a litle larger than some like My new go to tuner,positive
I got this on sale from GC for 80 shipped plus 7 tax arrrgh First and foremost this amp is AMAZING All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs lol and this amp does it all The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just cant be described they have to be heard The modulations and delreverbs are well done also There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software or taken out completely All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good even with my substandard playing ability Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use Headphones work well also About my only real complaints are so minor no place to store the Power cord or USB cord included Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour The headphone jack is a 35mm and most good headphones are still using the 14 Not a big deal but the 35mm to 14 adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down No corner protectors on this All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you 1000s of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams AMAZING,positive
Leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible Nylon has incredible strength but isnt very comfortable In my humble opinion cotton twill is totally the way to go Its comfortable and adequately strong This strap is sturdy and robust and its plain black You cant go wrong hereSchaller strap locks are compatible with this strap You should buy those too theyre greatIt gets five stars for being not only better than most other competing products but also a lot cheaper Cotton is the way to go folks,positive
This seems like a good product It is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great Too long is better than too short YAY No more batteries,positive

Its poorly made with attention to detail I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon But they will not screw down all the way and are losse It is useless Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine Doesnt work on dual mic clamps Useless,negative
Slips right under the guitar strings and does not impede your guitar playing in any way A very good design Great Idea,positive
Got this to put into my Pseudocaster project guitar Love it Be warned it does NOT come with springs claw or trem bar If you order this get the tremolo bar for the Mexican model The threads are smaller on theseIf you like to do 34dive bombs34 you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block It will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppinessLast important note Make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance If it matches spec on this Trem all the screw holes will match up Sustain block is HUGE,positive
I bought this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp It fits very well and sounds great Works very well,positive

I like Ernie Ball strings They are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands I tried I change strings every two weeks I tried the rest and returned to the best Ernie Ball says it all,positive
Just barely gets the job doneI have a Fender Jazz Bass Standard The shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing It is very low quality not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly Its JUST good enough but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open I would be constantly worried about it falling over I will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future Get something nicer,neutral
This capo works fine its strong and fits great on my Spanish or Steel string guitar I wouldnt ask for something more Capo,positive
This is the stand you remember from the band room Effective and built like a tank You will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task One note the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring invest in the optional foot covers if youre concerned The Stand You Remember,positive
Bought it as a gift Friend loved it very much Friend loved it very much,positive
I like the sound of this amp As has been said in other reviews if you want clean sound it isnt the loudest in the world but is loud enough for practice If you want a little distortion turn the gain up and you can have plenty of volume Im using it with a cheapo guitar from the sixties a Decca and I believe it produces the best sound I have ever gotten out of it Nice Little Amp,positive
Wow A bench that really holds my ass what can I say about it You really need it with the keyboard stand and it was necessary to the group Bench,positive
Its a cable no frills tangles pretty easy and due to its design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should average cable,neutral
This bag is simple yet its really thick so it makes you feel like your guitar is safe I have seen many gig bags rip tear or seen the straps rip off them but not with this baby its sturdy and cool with its design and pick designed zipper I didnt expect to be that cool Comfy,positive
This stand easily supports my 50 poundFender Frontman 212R 100Watt 2x12Inch Guitar Combo Ampat any height setting In fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifierI love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand It is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms Granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tankIn addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances The support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions You merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position Once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in placeMy only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle I would love it if I could adjust that too but I am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand One final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage Specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly 100 of my Frontman 212R although the difference in length is nominal I mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stagesOverall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavyduty At the current price at the time of this review its a bargain Rock solid and convenient,positive
These picks come in a large range of sizes but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar withThere is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers but it goes away after a bitThey seem to be decent quality The thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quicklyThese are ok to have around the house to play with but I would not recommend them for live performance Ok Picks,neutral
Best sounding vocal mike for the bucks I tried many MXL mikes under 200 and this was the only one that came close Unfortunately the top end isnt as defined as a AT2035 or NT1A So I ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter Nice vocal mike,positive
I payed the 11 for this just because the tuner I have was so slow to respond I needed something new The response time on this is like half a second and its super simple to use Keep in mind that the Snark website sells this tuner for 40 so 14 the cost here is definitely worth it Unbeatable deal,positive
These MoPads are pretty amazing I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these padsThese pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING Its like Im using actual studio monitors At 40 you cant go wrong with these pads for you studio It is a MUST to have these Buy these MoPads to protect yourself from Audio bleeding,positive
I only recently started playing the guitar and as a beginner I wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitarThis one came at a great price and its sturdy enough for me so I think this is very decent strap for the price I paid for it Its quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily Nice Strap,positive

Bought this switch as the OEM for my sons Bronco 40 which gives you an offpreset 1preset 2 switching set up Simple light and does what its suppose to Not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions Gives you lots of cable so that it is good and practical for real life gig set ups Cable and plug are solid thick Fender quality components Worth the money Simple classic Fender 1 button footswitch,positive
The saddle after some minor rounding at the edges fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my Takamine acoustic I havent replaced the nut yet but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable These are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investmentEdit I have since replaced the nut too and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one But the difference is negligible and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort Perfect,positive
Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others This is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the 500ma output Here is a comparison of the JP02 Chameleon and the OneSpot I have all threeTREX FUEL TANK CHAMELEON 1350maOutputs 13 9v12v 300maOutput 4 9v18V 150maOutput 5 9v12v 300ma Use 5 OR 6 only not bothOutput 6 12v AC 300maJOYO SP02 1000maOutputs 17 9v 100maOutput 8 DC 9V Maximum output of 500mAOutput 9 DC12V 100maOutput 10 DC18V 100maVISUAL SOUND ONESPOT 1700ma 9v onlyDaisy Chain Power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma Versatile cheap quiet,positive
Genius idea that I wish I thought of first I actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place I would definitely recommend Ingenious,positive
I dont use it for any heavy use I use it for podcasting purposes Havent had any problems So I cant speak to really heavy use of the product Works for me,positive
I cannot shower enough praise on the LPB1 It currently sells for about 40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal especially overdrivedistortion pedals or on its own I keep it on all the time since it always improves soundquality BUY ONE NOW,positive
Pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily Fits quickly and tightly I expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway Good price Does the job great price,positive
The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do The mic has a headphone jack Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings Also I like having the two polar patterns switchable from cardioid to omniI did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic as my voice is powerful Once I got the hang of it I had no problemsI did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless Please refer to my review of Cakewalk Music Creator 6 here on amazoncom It works great with my new Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5Overall this is an awesome product Love It,positive
For a cheap EQ it does great Sometimes though when I hit the switch the light turns on and there is a second before the signal comes back If it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating I am not too worried about it because the pedal loop pedal is still cheaper then the MXR or Boss Eqs Does its job,neutral
This is the one pedal I cant do without You can sculpt your guitar tone before it hits your amp and thats the key to getting a tight rhythm tone at high gain So if I encounter an amp that isnt tight enough or the high gain distortion doesnt sound good by itself I just turn down the gain or use a lower gain channel and then hit it hard with this pedal Sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortionAlright so here are some things you might want to know before you buy The gain knob when turned to zero still produces overdrive So you cant use this as a clean boost pedal With high output humbuckers you still get some mild tubelike overdrive at zero gain But this isnt advertised as a clean boost pedal So how much gain distortion does this pedal have if youre going into a clean channel of an amp Plenty for classic rock and blues Not enough for metal though if you crank the gain and high knob all the way you can just barely get a prog style metal tone But its not a distortion pedal its just an overdrive This thing uses tiny SMC components in the circuitry and therefore isnt really moddable Unlike the Bad Monkey this doesnt have an additional mixer cabinet emulated output Like a tube screamer it boosts the mids and reduces the bass so that going into a mushy sounding tube channel you get a tighter distorted sound Anyone who has a nice warm amp and gets this pedal thinking theyll get more of the same may be disappointed What they need instead is a transparent clean boost pedal that keeps their guitar the same tone just louder volume The classicmodified switch is pretty cool I have two guitars one is kind of bassy and scooped sounding the other is bright and middy Well using the switch I can make one come out more equivalent to the other when needed This keeps me from adjusting my amp each time I switch guitars Classic is a slightly lower gain more midboosted sound Quite tight Think Peavey 6505 EQ structure Modified is more scooped saturated Think Mesa EQ structure So this switch is a useful little bonus It eats batteries sucking in around 150 mA at 9V so my 300 mAH rechargeable lasts 152 hrs I swear if that blue LED werent so bright it would probably get an extra hour Instead of getting an adapter I got an 8battery AA clip 9V battery clip 12V DC plug and 8 Sanyo Eneloop batteries Hooked it up with negative tip positive sleeve and now I have a 16000 mAH monster about 100 hours play timeThis pedal is perfect You get what its advertised to do Its rugged looks good I havent found it to be noisy at all unless there was something wrong with my guitar strings not grounded through the bridge etc Someone mentioned the silver tops of the dials falling off as if they were decals but I looked and the knobs seem like all one solid piece to meAnother thing I found is that instead of using an overdrive plugin in my DAW if I use this real overdrive pedal in front of my interface that magically makes all hum noise from my pickups go awayOverall yes I highly recommend this and would suggest people check out the Hardwire Metal Distortion if they want something as a standalone rather than an overdrive into a crunchy amp Like others though I cant stop playing through this Great purchase especially if bought used Perfect,positive
I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic The gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone I might try a lighter set next time but these have a good clear tone from low to high and are fairly comfortable Good strings,positive

Having played guitar for 45 years I have tried and used many many capos Back in the day it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic It didnt work very well but it is what was available to me Later some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place and in tune as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar WITHOUT doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitars neck Many good capos have been made Until now perhaps the best options have been G7 which fails in its softness that allows strings to slip and SCHUBB which unfortunately snaps into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrumentThis new NS TRIACTION capo from Planet Waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectivelyDesigned by Ned Steinberger the NS the TriAction works on a triggerspringlever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck fits perfectly on the first attempt holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known more commonly used and more expensive This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for DAddario the famous string maker that produces the Planet Waves line of guitar accessorieshas done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other capo over time searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a sixstring guitar Finally The Capo I have been waiting for,positive

Ive been swapping back and forth between Evans and Remo for a while but after really liking the emad kick head I decided to lean more toward Evans just for consistency in my setupI consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest compatible drumhead to what I really liked from Remo on the Evans line and I was led to the G2 series from Remos Emperor series both being 2 plies of 7mm free floating filmHonestly I think Im going to stick with Evans from now on thoughI ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the level 360 sizing and I wanted to give them a try My fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that I got was new enough to be L360 sizedI got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy I use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process but it went smoothly Not sure if it was the placebo effect but I seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well deeper but just as resonant as an 808 kickThe coating seems to hold up better on the Evans heads as well Remo tends to flatten out within a few hours of play where the Evans not only lasts longer but has a more finished feel to them Theyre great,positive

I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 300mm picks Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I wont ever be without one Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most buying them in bulk this way means that Ill always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises An excellent pick for use on Mandolin,positive
It is not expensive but the item is sort of cheap I could have used a baggy to hold my picks It is all right,neutral
Ill try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said Setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic The adjustability is wonderful And the kit looks phenomenal out of the box That being said one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them Ill soon contact the company for a replacement the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard and even then its no guarantee and Im guessing due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads the snare often activates when I strike the hihat At first glance the different tone kits dont bring much to the table But there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls To a small extent Ive even been able to cover up the lessthanresponsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces My only other complaint is that the bass drum doesnt bring much to the table It sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedalIn short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box But its still fun to use So unless you plan to record with your electronic kit Id recommend this product as a fun musical toy But its certainly not up to par with some of the more expensive kits Ive used And recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare Just dont get your hopes too high,neutral
5 stars arrived on time and in good condition Price is excellent Will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day Great for my acoustic guitar,positive
I cant speak on the claim for a longer string life The strings are true to Elixirs quality and tone These strings sound great plug and unplugged I also had the opportunity from Vine to try the phosphor bronze too There are tonal differences as expected The 8020 are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp When amplified I did note less finger noise as I repositioned or slid my fingers along the strings I didnt notice any difference to the feel of the stringas compared to other nanoweb Elixir strings that I have used over the years Time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions For now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb youre still getting a good deal Great tone and less noise,positive
all joking aside these heads really are great tune em right and youll get a nice warm tone from them thats unmatched with other brands Great Head,positive
Its worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these It sure beats fixing a cracked neck headstock or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height An essential item,positive
Ive come to the point where anytime I buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves They are good quality decently priced and I dont have to worry about them shorting out on me Definite buy solid quality,positive
These strings are amazing they have increased power tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have They sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups The tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone I cnat say enough about them but get some for yourself Id be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings COBALTS who knew,positive
I was hesitant to purchase this as I really like the display of the previous models At first it seems like it might be less accurate It has less granularity in the display for example However it does seem to respond noticeably faster It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes And it may in fact be more precise though it takes learning how to work with the displayOn earlier Snarks the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note And they seemed pretty dead on especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to overtune Though once you get used to it it is easily avoidedAnyway on this unit I am not sure what each bar represents but it is very sensitive If the string is not quite perfect the On pitch bar will be lit up but so will one next to it Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on Then only the On pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far And the result sounds really right I think Ill be putting one of these on most instruments from now on Subtly Better than Previous Snarks,positive
These sound great and last a long time for me Plus theyre reasonably priced Put em in your case and dont be unprepared I like squirrels Nice strings,positive
Cheap The best way to describe this stand It serves its purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand Serves its purpose,negative
I have used this on my Les Paul It proved to be very functional The size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit In the past I have used the NS capo which is more compact This one is harder to lose because of its size I also appreciate the even tension across the strings Much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings A nice capo with even tension,positive
This product has a quiet metronome in a playing environment it wont be easy to hear The tuner works on a mic and that too will be easily overwhelmed in a social environmentThat said its lovely to see the strings true in Makes even first tuneup easy This accuracy will greatly help to tune the students ear making byear tuning possible soonerPretty nice Hate the color Oh well Very much okay for a student tunermetronome,positive
Nice grip Sound articulate Durable Nice I own HUNDREDS of picks and this is my new favorite I bought 2 gauges Both are going to be used for years Excellent choice new favorite,positive
I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat but the holes didnt line up it didnt fit between the neck and the bridge in fact it was completely wrong Nice quality though Nice quality though,negative
Strong metal construedLegs open to set up easy Easy to set mic slides in or out up or downPeaces stay tight stand,positive
This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly and Ive enjoyed using it It does its job and its well worth the money Very useful,positive
For those that want to recordI use Adobe Audition this item is good for recordingI use to use my sound card This provides a smoother sound and I dont have to worry about hissing when I recordYou can just plug in your guitar or bassHere is a letter I wrote to TascamOn humble advice I would forward this email to all of your subsidiaries any retail store that sells Tascam USB audio devices Anywhere in the worldJust today I got the new Tascam US100 USB audio interface It of course uses the Windows audio drivers A nightmare occured When I plugged in the device Windows XP had the usual detect USB device come up But to my horror it wound up saying A hardware problem occured your hardware may not operate properly something of that sortI spent over 4 hours trying to figure this whole thing out and I read the manual it came with Tried all sorts of things oh brother It still would not install By the way this happened with a previous USB audio device not made by Tascam that did the excact same thing on my computerBut to my luck I found out what the problem was Thank God for the website that had this on a blogIn the cwindowsinf folder there must exist two fileswdma_usbinfwdma_usbPNFIt is really the inf file that is important Some software seems to knock these out by renaming them towdma_usbinfbakwdma_usbpnfbakI simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names And lo and behold when I restarted my computer the Tascan US 100 workedIts easy to rename the files you just open wdma_usbinfbakwdma_usbpnfbak and then save them as wdma_usbinfwdma_usbPNFIts that simpleAnyone who works customer service for Tascam should know this Like I said it happend with a previous USB audio device that I had and I woulnd up selling it at eBay cause I was so frustratedIm happy with the Tascam US 100I hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer And it did the same with a USB phone Good item for guitar recording,positive
My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesnt sound any better This pedal covers the 34White Room34 by Cream Tone perfectly I gave it 4 stars because it hasnt been maintenance free The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives I probably should give it 5 Takes a licking and keeps on Wahing,positive
Strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded It was time to replace all with frest strings These are great did the job Acoustic Guitar strings,positive
This does the job but its fairly thin and not all that well padded For twice the price you can get a really nice Yamaha hard case that is way more than twice as good The strap that came with it is no great shakes either Adequate but minimally padded,neutral
Wasnt expecting much for this price But I was surprised Have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems Workmanship seems good Does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product I also have a more expensive Capo just like this one They look as though they come from the same factory More expensive is not always better Like It,positive
I got This amp for my 9 year old son along with a Squire mini strat Verry good combination My son loves them both Exelent am,positive
This will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster It will also give you a rhythm track to play along too The rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo It is not perfect as it has no onoff switch it reverts to default mode when you power it up it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats It only cost around 60 so perfection should not be expected For practice and the home studio it is great Effects and drum machine for a good price,positive
The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one no pun intended you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice Ive used many different types of picks over the years and Ive not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far its just a case of getting used to it This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing For me though Ill keep this among my collection of picks for use but its not my default or preferred choice for play Small Hard Good for Lead Guitarists Only,neutral
I know I know many people hate on this pedal calling it 34stale34 and 34generic34 The problem that they have is that they simply havent found the right settings on the pedal and the amp because after all the settings on both the amp and the pedal do make a difference One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion I have a Digitech Bad Monkey and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp With this pedal I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone Truly one of the best,positive
I own the older Color Bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one I love the size weight and LED bulbs on this one though It has a nice color throw too It also has speed control and audio control just like the older model butthis new LED version is built with less quality When you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one about every second They do not stop flashing when its plugged in since it dont have an onoff switch If you are using this on a switcher then it wouldnt be a problemId prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it dont When you try to adjust the audio flashing it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotationAlso the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back They will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around Within 1 hour of getting it I had to take it apart push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in placeI love the light but its not as useful to me since its always flashing Its possible I have a defective one not sureThe cool bright LED bulbs are the best part of this lightUPDATE I played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better When you turn it all the down the lights stopped flashing until the music started again The one I have never stops flashing even when the music stops I guess I got a bad one Nice LED light but,neutral
Was very pleased with JP 600L PB acoustic guitar strings I wipe the strings with a Planet Waves microfiber cloth each time after playing and it seemed like they would last forever Plus the tone of the bass strings was improved over the DAddario EJ16 light I had been using that were installed by the factory so I kept replacing with like kind 600L is the exact same string gaugesI read a review on Shorline Music an Amazon affiliate about the John Pearse 710 NM PB and after trying those I like them even better than the 600L They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L A D and G but add some strings from the medium size low E 055 replacing 053 and high E and B each increasing 001 from 012 to 013 and 016 to 017I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position no problemThe improvement in tone is in all the right places Very nice Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total from the 1622 lbs for the DAddario lightI play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all stringsI suppose things are always subject to change but for now I am amazed and delighted with these strings You wouldnt think a simple string change could make much of a difference but somehow these do Best strings I have tried,positive
I purchased a BUNCH of Planet Waves Classic cables for my new pedal board The cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you However I am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible My complaint like other reviews I read is that the end doesnt seem to fit snug on some connections For me these cables fit very well with the MXR pedals Dunlop wah and the Ibanez pedal The Boss pedals however were hit or miss Cant say for sure if this is Plant Waves design problem or Boss but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the Boss pedals I have a couple EHX pedals also one side is snug the other loose Anyway for the money I think you will be happy with the Planet Waves cable nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable Planet Waves Classics,positive
Beatiful amazing strap Very soft very confortable sits perfetcly on fender strap lock and looks like my G L Custom Fender Select Case What else so Really vintage style,positive
It just arrived to day and seems wellbuild Havent tried it yet Using with bass rig,positive
Perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart Good quality cable with a good price Most of my cables are from Planet Waves and Ive never had an issue Good cable,positive
Based on other reviews I made my purchase This is a great unit it sounds good and loud enoughTwo downsides both are about the noise1 I live on the 4th floor As long as I turn the volume up it acts like a radio I mean very loud radio background and I couldnt get ride of it This is the only thing that annoys me but I think it depends on where people live2 When this is not properly tuned it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise Other than the radio partNone of these are major issues as a mini amp you cant really expect that much not to mention its not expensive at all Overall I like it and I would recommend itBy the way this unit comes with a 9V battery A Great Mini Amp and plus A Radio Receiver,positive
Purchased these for a new Heritage H575 arch top A few months later the high E string unwound from the ball end Overall good strings good sound this set simply didnt last very long I will replace with 12s however For me the 11s felt a little loose The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model Ill be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s A string gave out,negative
While I love and trust DAddario strings i am subtracting one star because I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets For my acoustics I do not always change out all the strings at once I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on soundAnyway these are classic strings that I grew up with but as I get more involved with playing having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated Especially if you like to save your single strings for use Nice acoustic strings,positive
Put these on my new La Patrie Motif and could not be happierThe tension is just right for soft finger style 34manouche jazz34Sleepy Django Wonderful sound and fabulose feel,positive
I bought this to tune my 12string without using the end jack The headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough 8220feel8221 the tone of each string with only minor plucking I use it on Chromatic but it includes Bass Uke and Guitar too I need it to be sensitive and adjustable,positive
These are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum Designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job You do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind Being 10s they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is I love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that They are made in the USA which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there put America to work Get to picking Great strings color coded,positive
I honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all First the wire clipper side is relatively bulky no flush cutting and doesnt open easily very stiff action so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view ick And as for the winder I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on so no nice 34tight34 fit more of a 34jiggle34 fit Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesnt help Didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing Just looked at it guess that notch in the peg winder is itEach time I have set out to use it I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters NeedleNose Pliers Setthe pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar Ill try the notch bridge peg puller But other wise this thing gets a serious twostar 34meh34 Hasnt made things any easier,negative
Ive two of these stands On one of them the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand youll see that the base of the tubing is welded there Mine lost its weld so the tubing is not secure to the grey base they separate I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floorUPDATE 1912 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND BEWARE and you should be aware that the stand is assembled inwait for itChina That may explain why it failed but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it I guess he doesnt want me to buy any more of his products or refer others to his products Well thats his policy Thats okay hes got competition and Ill be purchasing from them instead BEWARE Chinese stand FELL APART Ingles says Im SOL,negative
I thought I was getting something that would boostamplify the signal from my bass to the amp It didnt but at its cheap price it wasnt bad and I found other uses for it They make ones that will boost the signal so if thats what youre looking for be a careful consumer My bad,neutral
Its a nice standcheap but should suffice I wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine You get what you pay for,neutral
Depends on what your looking for Is this a POGnope but it has some tricks up its leave for the price The only con I can give is when playing chords when dropping down like a drop D it doesnt always sound grant Bar chords work a little better Awesome pedal,positive
its a very genericsounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp The same is true of many of the pedals from this era including the gasp Tube Screamer The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp but not too many people will tell you that its a great standalone distortion because its not Same goes for the Boss DS1 Now heres where things get interesting There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely Monte Allums and others that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks For the cost of this pedal and the 30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod are well worth it Mine is modified with the Monte Allums TriGain Rectifier modification and its absolutely killer I use it as a lead boost but by itself its a nice overdriven tone that youll find plenty of use for If you want a basic solid wellbuilt distortion pedal this is it but by itself the Boss DS1 is really nothing special But as a platform for greatsounding mods you cant go wrong Its been around for decades but,neutral
Needed a pre amp tube for my Hartke LH500 and ordered one of thesewhile waiting ended up buying and using a 12AX7 Groove Tube so this one still sits in my gear bag waiting to be powered up If that time comes Im sure this will be a great tube Probably a great tube,positive
This is a great effect Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products have always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable This Analog Chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should Its great to add low and high end cut to make it even more versatile It is also very small and will not take a lot of space in your board I actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations You will not be dissappointed at all Ships fast Highly recommended MXR Analog Chorus Great effect,positive
This is my second and I love them so much They work flawlessley and tune is amazing Get one and dont hesitate Nice,positive
If you have a trem system on your guitar these bullet ends really do transfer tone energy through the trem block for sustain I added a big block and these strings and it has really brought my strat to life Highly recommended Wow what some stings for strat,positive

Good cords with a decent length I like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box I order the longer cord to go to my wah pedal which I always set outside of my pedal board Works quite well GOOD CORD,positive
This is my second condenser microphone and I have to say that I love it I previously owned an Audio Technica 2020 condenser mic which sounded thin and not as natural to me I noticed that this mic does not really boost any frequencies like some other mics do in this price range With this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get Of course room acoustics and microphone positioning all play a large part in the final soundI use an Alesis mic preamp with a Focusrite 2i2 interface and the recordings sound clean Another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic However even with all the polar patterns that this mic has to offer I usually just leave it on cardioid since I mainly use the M179 for vocals Although I usually only record vocals I also record electric guitar acoustic guitar and drums with the same microphoneOverall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great I think that for this price it will be hard to find another microphone that can perform on the same level A work horse with transparent sound,positive
I write and record my own music I stink at writing drums I dont play drums I dont really have room for a drumset and I really dont want to spend the money on a drumset to see if I can figure it out This is a great program for nondrumming one man bands like me MIDI drums and the drum sounds from my Yamaha keyboard just wasnt cutting it It works with Ableton Live 9 with no problems Tons of different grooves It sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset Very easy to use Great program,positive
I sent it back probably due to my ignorance Has multiple patterns to collect sound Was a clear mike but I didnt detect any body to the sound Maybe a preamp would have helped I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT1A which is probably similar in character My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars Suspicious ratings to me Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out But since I found a good solution I dont think its worth the effort Clear mike my own spelling of microphone,positive
A great item for the price Comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble You only need to put in the two screws that attach the head to the stand Each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand It took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions It looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands Its also pretty lightweight and as I said the head comes off with two screws if you want to break it down for traveling I am very satisfied with my purchase Good price good item,positive
This stand it just arrived in the mail will be durable in the years to come with my music I can tell Awesome stand and I would recommend to anyone Sturdy and well capable stand,positive
I love a lot of Danelectro products but not really this one i give it 35 because it works as advertisedThe features are good True Bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are goodBUT HERES MY ISSUE The Distortion is not Crunchy It distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional it has no depth to itThats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres but i play a lot of bluesrock I ended up switching to a VintageTube overdrive by behringerNot for me maybe for you A little flat,neutral
This AC adapter in my opinion should not even qualify to be reviewed since we all know it should be included with the product it is powering That being said it functions as it was intended to which is to power a Yamaha PSRE333 61key portable keyboard It fits perfectly and stays put all while transmitting electrical current from my homes 110v outlet into the aforementioned Yamaha keyboard Thanks for readingSPO Minus 1 star for price,positive

These pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material It wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone In fact I found it increases speed These are perfect for a fastpaced style of picking The tone is bright and snappyGood quality material ensures I wont be needing another set for a long time Perfect grip shape durability and tone,positive
Just a bag for my guitar stand No big deal but it sure makes it easier when I have all that stuff to lug around I love my Hercules guitar stands but they a dont like to stay put when folded up This takes care of that problem for a couple of bags Sturdy material nice draw string to close it up Shoulder strap works just fine Glad I bought it Just another thing to make my travels easier,positive
No problems with seller and product came quick I wasnt expecting much from the mic I mean cmon what can you expect for that price I wanted it to lay down some quick vocal melodies over rough tracks and its good enough for that Doesnt have a really great range I think the RockBand mic has a better range than this but like I said its a cheap mic so what can you expect Honestly I should have saved my money and been a little more patient to get a better mic Seller is great but the product is ok,neutral
I love this little guy Clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you it will still accurately tune the guitar Very easy and simple to use I paid 9 for it and it is 10 times better than the 40 one I have The best,positive
It works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes It is easy to use easy to put on easy to adjust the tension and lightweight When not in use I keep it parked on the headstock The shape and ergonomics are a mix between a Kyser and a Schubb S1 Five stars all the way Highly recommended Easy to use Works great,positive
The picks we received were Legacy and not Alice brand While not as pictured these are good enough for us as we my daughert son and me learn to play guitars The mix of different thicknesses was fairly even so we were able to select the one that felt right for each of usThe pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picksCFH Bulk Picks Legacy Not Alice,neutral
When I purchased this Id seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar Guess what As far as I can tell there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with This is NOT worth the money Is It Really Worth It,negative
These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they dont feel as good eitherI guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings Sound is lacking,positive
It seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right Its just a spring and a handle but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brandThis one worked very well for me and at this price I am able to have a couple extra lying around Competively Priced Quick and Easy Capo that works,positive
This winder makes changing strings a breeze and I like that theres an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string I also love the part on the end that pulls out the pins from the bridge So this item is three tools in one Great product for a great price,positive

What a good buy This gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice Luv the zip pocket in the front perfect for strap snark capo whatever Bought this for my hubbys tenor uke and one just like it tho smallerfor my concert uke Highly recommend Exactly What I Wantedg,positive
Straps dont get any better than this Super leather very well puttogether Perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets For the gigging pro I think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight excellent just excellent My third Levys strap and still thrilled to wear it,positive
Very sturdy and awesome pop filter Adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter I would recommend this to anyone Awesome,positive
This stands up and holds the microphone in placeThe stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use Stand Up Product,positive
I requested and received one of these as a Christmas gift then bought another so I could keep the first one at a weekend place where I keep a guitar It works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings and keeps strings clean and rustfree important here in humid Florida and strings last longer than they did before I started using this even though Ive always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each useI keep my Slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploctype bag because its not airtight when you snap it together and I dont want it to dry out I hope when it does dry out that I can just add some juice to rejuvenate it I just dont know what kind of liquid to use I dont want to drop 8 or so for a new one every time it dries out Any ideas are welcome please add a comment to this review if you can help me outBottom line it extends the life of my strings and thats always good My Second One,positive
If you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home This is it Have not gigged with it as yet So no comments as to its toughness Great value though Great value Guitar Stand,positive
It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok The tapered design might be to make picks eject easier I never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to Except I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars These are good dont get me wrong Its what it is but,positive
Adjustments are easy to make and the fitfeel is fine No fancy designs but a great value for the price Durable and comfortable,positive
Love the colors and the price cant be beat Wished maybe they came in yellow Other than that great picks Great set,positive
Ive always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this mediumlight set and I was not disappointed There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings Ive always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to Would recommend to any level of guitar player Great step up strings,positive
If you need an 808 Clone on the Cheap this is your pedal Dont be fooled though it does not school the classic Tube Screamer but it holds its own This was a main staple on my pedalboard until I found a great deal on a Bad Monkey and then sadly it came off I was not looking to replace it at the time it just happened the Bad Money did what I needed it to do betterI recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an 808 but has the budget of your average gigging musician Maxon 808 15000Ibanez TS9 100Joyo Vintage OD 50 Excellent 808 Clone,positive
Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right but now it works greatThe black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being playedHeight adjustment was also important If the latch is to high it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up Too low and it does not sound rightThis replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs so I am completely pleased with itdefinitely worth 1300 excellent for the money,positive
This is exactly what I was hoping for The string cutter works better than expected Its nice not having to go hunt down diagonal pliers when its string changing time The only little issue is that its a little tougher to spin really fast than the little string winders because of the grip No biggie though Perfect,positive
as usual another good piece of equiptmentfrom behringer I not only use it for my guitars but also on my keyboardmakes real good sound very adaptable again will buy more of their products as usual most of my purchases on amazon were quality stuff at good prices very efficient and fast delivery times wow,positive
Do as the manual says lube them up every so often and these will work like a charm I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button and taking a chip out of the binding The black ones work well with most finishes and it works with most straps as long as the ends arent ridiculously thick Inside of the box it came with 2 screw sizes One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal No biggie however as most straps are adjustable so just adjust for the change in strap position and youre golden Youd be hard pressed to find a fault with these,positive
I love these strings They are bright and feel really good on my handsI have a Gretsch and use 11s Daddario on it best strings Ive found so far I also bought a pack of half wound 11s to TRY Ill decide which to use round or half wound after my experiment Awesome Strings,positive
Elixir strings are very nice so slick and last forever compared to standard stringsBut i will admit D addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed Some people say they are too slick and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way But you will get over that once you see how long they last Love these strings,positive
Right size well made and these do the job I prefer them at 90 degrees so these are just right Perfect,positive
This strap is very well made The leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar Very happy with this low cost strap Nice,positive
Got this for a 15 year old learning guitar They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner My how things change when you can see what is really going on Recommended It is good,positive
nice comfortable very comfortable to use and easy to install on the guitar and was just like the picture showed great,positive

I was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar These work great and look sweet too Their shape keeps your guitar securely in place but is also easy to unhook when your ready High quality product and very easy to install Just what I wanted Excellent Product,positive
For 20 you cant go wrong Its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere Cool little amp,positive
It stays out of the way on my guitar however be aware that the mounting tab gets a little loose I am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip Stays hidden,neutral
My son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand It comes with a cord that has a standard 14 inch end I plugged it into a small guitar amp They use it mainly to sing along with their cdsmp3s Note that this is not really a mic I would use in my studio it is more of a toy to be honest but a quality toy for a young child In that regard I give it five stars cool for the kids,positive
I must first state for the record I hate strap locks Hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually Ive never met a set I liked in any single way Ive only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it In fact EVERY instrument Ive owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with Locktite When you install them you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material leather nylon etc so it is never really tight Plus theres only about two threads on the slim little nut and if they arent a really tight match to the other half wear very quickly especially since you have to tighten them so often Duncan type often suffer from nonpositive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed Then theres the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons your strap is only compatible with the ones which match And then there is the the metalonmetal clankyness Yuck Oh and and the cost Moving onWhy are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant They are NOT strap locks If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them as you should then in order to put your strap on and take it off you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument This isnt something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage Sometimes the simplest design is the best design And theyre pretty tooDownsides I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly If they dont using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer especially considering if the screws cut new threads youre pretty much uh screwed The washers these come with are pretty small too so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons With a brand new strap they can be a bit tricky to get on but just as tricky to get off which is good That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap especially if it is made from cheap materials With older straps just as with any traditional strap button you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap but it is very easy to verify and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly But with strap locks if theres a problem youll have to grab some tools to fix it or replace it entirely Talk about a false sense of security With PEs Elliptical End Pins you just put the strap where it should be and youre setIf you are one who is taken to doing backflips or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hulahoop onstage then these probably wont save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkeys worst intentions But if either of these antics are your norm you might be better served by a permanently attached strap or perhaps therapySince writing the review above Ive ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses Im done with traditional strap buttons and dont imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks Excellent design simple solution for those who hate strap locks,positive
Let me say this is a a great cable in every aspectFirst it works extremely well No popping or clicking at all Very flexible but solid feel to it It looks better in person than in the pic too And with the lifetime guarantee you really cant go wrong here Sweet Cable,positive
thank u behringer your pedals really kick ass this one is outstanding and for the price can not get a better deal highly recommended freaking awesome,positive
I bought this to get the grime and finger prints off of my Les Paul before putting it on eBay to sell Worked great Didnt harm the finish at all Safe on Nitrocellulose,positive
Works great with or without polish It is a good size and the ziplock bag it comes in keeps the polish I use from drying out Very nice microfiber cloth,positive
The tabs broke off right out of the package the other reviews made me aware this may happen An easy fix with some Super Glue and for the price who cares if I have to fix it It is 100 accurate and very easy to use Other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money Highly Recommend Great little tuner,positive
I like it This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments Like all other pedals its not The Pedal seems like you always need another one But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone After youve settle on a setting you like it adds a subtle but noticeable addition to your sound End of line adjustments,positive
not high quality but has cut dolphin detailing on the tuners just as described works like it should good or begginers quality expected for price,neutral
Originally putoff by the low price I went with the reviews Simply AWESOME This amp is packed with features BeginnerIntermediate level player would be very pleased The best part is its not at all complex to learn the features Perfect,positive
Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together As of yet i havent had one go all crackly which considering they get frequent use is pretty good Often cheap cords die within a year or so Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things and this one in particular is cheap and accessible I probably have around twelve of themEnjoy No frill cordage,positive
This is a Very nice cable I like this one better than all the other ones that I Own Its thick and the sound is great Then one day an Amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off That stunk Gut Cable,positive
I use this for my Epiphone Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul It fits perfectly in the case one of the best cases I own and have seen the carpet is awesome also has a pocket in the middle what holds the neck up and can fit a strap and even a pedal Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case Awesome Case,positive
A needed accessory for any vocal recording period My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway Its necessary so get one already,positive
I love these picks They arrived well packaged and NOT loose They feel great in my hand and the Mediums are the perfect thickness for my playing style Not too thicknot too thinThe abalone looks cool and is easy to spot when I drop them on the carpet I have tried other brands Dunlop totex etc and the fender are by far my favoriteYou will not be disappointed Awesome,positive
I had high hopes for this replacing my pedal board but there are a couple of things I dont like about it It has a button clip on the back which is nonremovable so makes it all but useless if you dont put it on your belt I dont know about you but wearing something on my belt with two 14 inch cables is quite a feat Add to that possible lines for headphones and an ac adapter and you look like OctoManAnd what possible function does the kidney bean shape make other than making it odd to put down anywhere with the belt clip sticking out The menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad The main rotaries on the front have two functions depending whether you are holding another key down to access the second set This is extremely difficult to do if you need to switch between settings in a live environment I have had multiple mistakes and frustrationsIMHO the POD really belongs on a desktop for DAW recording It doesnt have much value on your belt clip Still have my effects rack Awkward size and dont like the double function keys,neutral
The picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package All 12 picks were there Saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car They feel good in my hand while strumming the strings Good deal and I will purchase again Good feel good price,positive
Overall as with most Zoom products this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by its competition in its price category except for perhaps the Olympus LS11 which is cheaper but the Zoom has a ton more featuresBuild quality is good features are good the only unit in its price range to have combi XLR 14 TRS inputs and it records to a high qualityHowever I think Zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it THE BEST digital recorder under a grand and making it a great USB digital interface instead of spending money on the 4 track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works OK but is much more easily realized in a simple digital 4 track recorder eg a Tascam PocketStudioThe manual is a farse in Japanese English translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit although its fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices I gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus but the unit is still a little fiddly to operate in advanced modesMy last comment is in regards to the H4n as a USB interface I have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface First of all it is only 16 bit and I can only get it to work with MME drivers I have read that there are some ASIO drivers available for Windows 7 but I use XP I may try to use ASIO4all but it is still only 16 bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work There is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a DAW software I have only tried it with Cakewalk Sonar I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly I cant seeing it being of much use in this regardHowever overall the unit is stellar and I highly recommend itPS I read some folks having issues with line inputs eg recording a stereo mix from a mixer I personally dont see the problem the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types If it is not working for your situation one can always use a TRS Hi Z unbalanced to XLR Low Z balanced converter available at Radio Shack for around 20 bucks Best in its price range,positive
I purchased this for my love of playing guitar I like blues style and classic rock This 25 watt amp will get the job done It is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means After a few months of playing the bass knob just blew So I had no bass control Arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging You just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want Took me like half an hour to get the right amp settingsThis amp is rated 75 watts so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt into 8 ohm I would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or Jensen Id recommend it but dont buy it if your looking for a really decent tone Its just a practice amp Its okay for a starter amp,neutral
Tried these on a Laguna acoustic guitar They are basic standard traditional strings They sound good they are light weight On this guitar they sound a bit too bright My preference is to use Elixirs prefer the feel and sound on this guitar Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings LightThese strings do not last less time than the Elixirs Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar Some people like a brand new set before every gig others will go weeks or months before changing If you are an every gig person well the Martin set is probably perfect for you they are much less expensive than others Leaving strings in for an extended period Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better ideaThere is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar The choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play I think the Martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style So for the price these are an excellent value Good Value,positive
I have nothing but good things to say about the Snark SN1 Accurate easy to use clear display and much smaller than I anticipated yet its quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar At home or on the go I cant see the need for another tuner Fantastic,positive
Im an amateur musician and songwriter and this has been very helpful for songwriting ideas I havent studied music formally so I cant recall what a C7 looks like versus a F7 so when I discover a chord shape its easier for me to diagram it than to look it up on the web This helps Great for songwriting,positive
A im very impress with the precition of this tuner Its very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar even using a capo 100 recommendedBattery is included also so you can use it right out the box A must have tool for every guitar player,positive
This will b my 2nd one of these so to me its worth it The 1st one I loaned to a friend and never got back so for 10 I just got another I think their pretty accurate I normally tune by ear but if theres a few of us playing then sometimes someone needs one and I always use it putting on new strings myself As far as battery life goes you can get them right on Amazon They are cheap you can get a package of 6 each one lasting over a year or if you prefer you can go over to Walmart and get them in the jewelery section worth the money,positive
Nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer playpractice periods and less finger fatigue I would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic especially good for beginners Sweet sound,positive
These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar They are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex Weve tried DAddario brighter sound DAddario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set EXP 8020 Lite and Martin a little stiff Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12555 MSP4150 In the end these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitarThe difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nanos have a very light coating that you almost dont feel So if you like standard not coated strings the nanos are probably the way to go If you want a bit of softness the polys are a better betAs has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar For the combination we have these are outstanding stringsOn the strings lasting longer thats hard to say Fresh strings do sound better Its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings But Im not certain these last so much longer We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability Corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing stringsElixir is a wonderful company On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time Elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesnt perform up to your standardThe other amazing thing Ive watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and Im still very confused The Elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings I swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes It is so simple and so reproducible I love this technique Excellent strings Great customer service and great video for changing strings,positive
daddario makes great strings this just where not the gages I was lookin forother than that I like this brand of strings daddario,neutral
This is the best Delay I have tried thus far Extremely versatile and as is typical with all boss pedals absolutely sturdy A delay is such a necessary addition to ones personal effects and I really cannot emphasize enough just how perfectly this works in pretty much any style of music Well worth the price Item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging A perfect delay,positive
These are solid cables tight fit in receptacles no introduction of noise and no discernible loss of signal Especially considering the price these are brilliant I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who werent sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices They work great,positive
This is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight I dont have a bass however it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar Wedgie Bass Pick Holder,positive
Not sure if it did improve my sound or not I have a fender dreadnought acoustic and I couldnt really tell that much Maybe just a little Its okay,neutral
These picks far exceed my expectations I mean how good could a pick be anyway These are the classiest nicest looking picks I own They look great feel great and play great Call me a snob but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 ChevelleIf you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a 34feel good34 gift to yourself buy theseI love the color and texture too they dont slip or move around as you play Classy fuctional iconic name,positive
I bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases I use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner Sadly I could not find any untreated cloths locally so I had these shipped through prime These cloths are gentle and prevent scratching the finish unlike some of the microfiber types I see here and in stores that tend to leave streaks and in some cases scratches on the guitar good cloth to store in cases,positive
Im not sure what else to say The picks work well and they dont wear out easily I like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they dont slide out work well,positive
Over the years Ive literally owned dozens of electronic tunersgenerally five or six at a time in various locationsranging from a 12 Musiciansfriend promotional item to a 200 rack mount Most have been in the 30 range from Sabine Yamaha Korg and Seiko The Seiko SAT800E is my all time favorite because like Mama Bear in the fairy tale it affordably splits the difference between too small and too big It stays put on the floor when I run it inline between my guitarbassuke and my amp and its LCD display is large enough to be legible when Im standing At the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case Beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare Bravo A Cut Above Most,positive
I8217m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they8217re what they are Guitar picks However the price was good Good price,positive
Got mine for under 130 and its a great Mic I can use it for vocal tracks or recording for webcasts that kind of thing or recording studio guitar sounds etc Awesome mic Awesome Mic for a great price,positive

Every once and a while I play the bass guitar and while I use the Snark for my guitars itwill not tune the bass this tuner does a great job of that task plus the guitar Blows away the Snark,positive
Great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless Unless you have a mixer you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this Really puts out the sound though and I guess thats what you get an amp for I used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 23 to fill the place Very nice effects on both channels Great amp,positive
This is a great gig bag for the money It has more padding than I thought it would have has very strong construction and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well Its even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks For the money this is the best one Ive bought on Amazon and will certainly buy it again in the future Highly recommended Strong and light Gig Bag,positive
They are tiny About half the size of a regular pick My fingers keep hitting the strings Nice grip area Will last forever sound great A bit too thick for me Too small,neutral
Who doesnt love these tuners Easy to use easy to read and has options that I dont even use Highly recommend this Awesome,positive
Sturdy great latches I love the handle so comfortable to carry nice and big so it fits your hand wellNot a lot of interior storage but my Strat fits well it is very secure insideThere is enough room inside for a strap and a cleaning cloth a few picks and a set of strings but not much elseMy old case I could also fit a Boss TU3 tuner this ensures a thinner lighter caseThe case is also very well balanced with the guitar insideIf I purchase another Strat I will purchase this case again Great case Heavy duty Rugged Sturdy 10232012 still holding up well I Love This Case,positive
Its not an entire bridge assembly but its exactly what I needed In my opinion it is worth the money What I needed,positive
This bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods My only complaint is that I wish it had just a little more height adjustment maybe 1 inch Overall it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child Comfortable and functional,positive
After years of having a large awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when youre already on the stageI love that the lights are bright and easy to see unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read Dark grey letters on a light grey screen Even better is that the light colors are different for flat sharp and ontune which makes it even easier May not seem like a big deal when youre tuning alone at your house but when youre on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place those little details really helpThe only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs Not impossible but not terribly convenient either It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar headThe 80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine and quite frankly 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it In fact the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home but like this one better on stage because its low profile Looks more professional and I like that As accurate as my 80 tuner but more convenient,positive
Ive used the FX600 for a couple of years Ive got a pedal board with several pedals but if I had to take only one pedal with me and I often do when I have to travel lite this is the pedal I take Not only do I get a full selection of effects but the pedal doubles as a DI unit solving input issues on some problem sound systems Ive played thru Thats probably an unintended benefit but I find it a valuable feature which gives me confidence to play thru any system FYI my buddys Digitech multieffect pedal actually introduces hum into systems where this FX600 has helped me get a cleaner sound While this unit has no tone adjustments it also adds something to make my guitars sound better I know that is sort of vague The only down side of this pedal that I have found is that because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal it is a little hard to make precise adjustments But with what this pedal DOES do for me thats a small price to pay For this price I cant see why anyone would not like this pedal Wouldnt leave home without it,positive
I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58 Id probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 Gs simply isnt that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks But with respect to the Shure Im less sure that the SM58 isnt worth 40 more than the PG58 Perhaps if you have a sufficiently highpowered and clean amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice the two mics could be mistaken for one another It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency PA that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58 Switching to the more common admittedly more expensive mic gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice at least for announcementsPS I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58 Since the rise of the digital audio workstation who doesnt have a computer with free included Garage Band on it large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place Despite appearances when it comes to mics size doesnt matterexcept for appearances directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap halfway around the face knowing that the girls in the frontline think theyre coolthey look just like Madonnaa or Janets headgear Some of the best mics are tiny with an opening the size of a pinhole Shure quality and construction but not quite equal to the SM58,positive
It definitely changes the sound of my Classical Guitar for the better Pavan TP30 It allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonicspartials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental My initial thought was that it did away with the blurriness of the low bass to midrange response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitars range Amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do Highly recommended Amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do,positive
Great product Great price Buy itAs a pro musician my entire teenage and adult life I say Ya good capo Great product Great price Buy it,positive
It might just be my pickups or my strings but if you set the bass above seven or so the bass gets fairly fizzy on the E string The effects loop is useless and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals but thats good news because with this amp you dont need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive So if you ever do use a drivendistorted tone you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp Really strong tone but the bass can get overpowering,positive
When youre looking into a quality cable you wouldnt expect to find such quality for this price range The construction is solid well insulated cording and having done some test recording with it I will definitely be purchasing more of these as the studio expandsWhile there may be more expensive cables out there I feel that for the price you are getting something of a higher quality than you would expect Didnt notice any defects and no staticnoisebleed despite being around lots of other audio equipment monitors etc Even touring or in a mobile studio application I wouldnt be worried about this cable failing or noise bleedOnly regret is not picking up a few more at this price but Im sure to order more for future expansionNot worried at all about using this cable as part of my signal chain and was relieved to have it shipped out and arrive in a timely mannerQuality product quality vendor Quality product timely delivery,positive

Compared to the nickel wound XL light gauges I buy in the 3set boxes the balanced tension XL set amounts to slightly lighter D and A strings 025026 and 034036 respectively which I can feel as well as a slightly thicker B string 0135013 which frankly I cant feelThe XLs are comparable in gauge to Ernie Ball Regular Slinky yellow But if youre used to Slinkys as I was for many years the nickel wounds feel noticeably coarser to the skin and took awhile to get used to I love them now for blues rock or funk any kind of playing where you want to dig in a bit for tone although I will say that for slide especially when recording at relatively low volume they dont give quite the same glassysounding undertone to my ears as steel wounds something I happen to preferI put the XLs on an Squire Strat which I like to bend strings on and the 5position switch gives me a nice range of color to compare Like the regular XLs I noticed very little new string zing after giving them a good stretch When my skin is dry indoors during the winter the nickels can feel rough at first but in warmer humid temps I sweat more and they get as slick as any steel woundsI think the balanced tension is more a factor when playing chords than single lines and for me its more of feel thing rather than something I hear That doesnt make it any less significant to me Ive tossed brand new sets of strings and sold perfectly good guitars on the vague basis they didnt quite feel rightTo tell the truth when playing out I prefer an even heavier set than regular lights for tone but at home when recording or just playing for myself I like the amount of resistance I get from the nickel wound XLs versus the Slinkys I used since I began playing as a kid You have to work a little harder with the nickels for bends and intonation but I like the tone and feel overall and I think its made me a more precise player A Little Different From Regular XLs,positive
I own a number of guitar hangers This one was a good buy for the money I have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive but also a good deal pricier For what I spent for this one it is adequate as long as it 34holds Up34 Pun intended Good Hanger for the,positive
We all have different tastes in guitar picks I know As I wrote elsewhere the Dunlop Tortex are awful for acoustic in my opinion These Ultex are much better Not as noisy better feel Still not my favorites Ill have them with me for spares Not Bad Picks,neutral
I have a Squire tele and replaced the tuners with these The tab holes didnt match up they are bigger than the Squire originals but it was no problem to set new holes and tighten them up The hold tunings and make string changing a breeze Highly recommended True Fender product Tele replacement tuners,positive
I bought these because I wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming I would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming Good picks,positive
These things are great No more twisting for 5 mins per string no more running around the house looking for a pair of clippers For the price its definitely worth it imho Handy tool to have,positive
Awesome little tuner very accurate and I can store it almost anywhere much cheaper online too for the price its a steal Very nifty,positive
Yes finallyafter reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders I hit the nail OkI play in a really LOUD metal bandnone of us are record savvy or anything like thatwe just want to rehearse and rock the hell out But we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember that riff for the next rehearsal We tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice well the ZOOM H4N changed everything Simple to use and the quality of the recordings are justwell INCREDIBLEfor such a little thingno distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it I still need to read a lot of the users manualbut take my wordI hate those manualsI figure how to use it extremely basic and just hit the REC button and rock out Finally when I came back home I plug it into my pc and I was amazed by the quality of the soundwe recorded in 4CH mode with two extra micsand manI havent even tried the multi channel mode yetthanks ZOOMnow rocking and basic recording its how its supposse to beSIMPLE AND FUNcheers METAL BANDSOR ANY KIND OF BANDLISTEN,positive
What can you say about the best of the best I wouldnt use anything else on my guitar to get the best tonal quality from it These strings seem to last longer than the others Ive used I highly recommend them Cant get any better,positive
I dont know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the allmighty vintage tube screamers of Ibanez but it is an exact clone including the same component values potentiometers ICs JRC etcFor proof that it is exactly the same I was able to modify it for different frequency response corner frequency and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in TS9 mods Of course the board is layed out a little differentlyThe only reason I gave it 4 really 45 stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise hiss at higher gains but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter this gives it the characteristic midrange boost It can be cut with the tone control but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier and or a onespot power adapter Great overdrive pedal,positive
Ive been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really dont play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy Great stuff,positive
Perfect perfect size weight shape I like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worldsRecommended Love them,positive
Finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem Also used these for the tremolo back cover Very handy And no digging the the parts bin for screws Glad I got these in time,positive
I dont use the other features but as a tuner this product is spot on Filters out noise well when using the mic Only two things to gripe with 1 The leg that you can use to prop this up isnt very usable and 2 Its not great for gig use as the screen isnt that readableAs a home tuner or for a brightlylit gig excellent Great Tuner,positive
Im using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface Unfortunately these angle the speakers down by default so I had to do some cutting and rearranging but it worked out If you need to cut these to fit your speakers try to find something better than scissors because its quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them They work,neutral
but works well I have a different brand which has a string and small hook but I find when adjusted correctly I cannot remove it this sling keeps the head loop large so you can get it off without a binch of hassle I find the hook to be wide though and could be alot better with a thinner hook alittle thick,positive
Go build your own Build it to your specs and have a solid stand If not you can find a lot better head stands This one was a huge disappointment Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick Im back with my wood block and am happy Build your own seriously,negative
This is a proven classic Using it to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet Sounds fantastic and is solidly built Classic that delivers,positive
Until today I do not own the Fulltone pedal that this product was designed to replicate but you can search YouTube and see several comparisons and there is no audible difference Aside from that this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit Its not a metal type distortion but it nicely covers everything else I play an Ibanez Artcore through a Vox AC15 in a Christian band and set with just a small amount of drive at about the 900 position this pedal does not add color to your signal and the sound of your amp shines through nicely Thats the whole point the reason we choose a certain amp is because we like the way it sounds so when we push it with an overdrive pedal we dont want it to change the sound of the amp we simply want to kick it in the rump a little Or a lot And the Ultimate Drive does it nicely The drive could best be described as somewhat gritty and smooth at the same time like sand in a smoothie Driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones But I think it sounds best with just a small amount of kick right into a tube amp Im not exactly bringing home tons of money so its nice to see that there are pedals designed to give great tone to even tightwads like myself The only thing that I could consider to be a downside is the stupid graphic of Satan Darth Maul Gene Simmons or whatever that thing is thats painted on the metal case Other than that if youre in the market for a boutiquestyle overdrive at about 13 the cost youve found it ONE FINAL NOTE One unexpected benefit of this pedal is that the overdrive does wonders with a singlecoil strat Really It gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone I cant think of any other pedals Ive owned that could do this SECOND FINAL NOTE Im almost embarrassed to admit this but I also played it through a cheap solid state Fender Frontman 25R and it sounded great even through that piece of rubbish As a Christian musician I can say that this may not exactly qualify as a miracle but its pretty close If you told me that I could buy an awesome overdrive pedal for 40 I would have said you were smoking crack,positive
I use this cable between my fender blues jr and a ditto x2 looper it works great and the angled jack puts less stress on the cable and input jack works great so far,positive
If you perform at gigs you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue This is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations I used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasnt really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around This stand does the trick beautifully Nice job Fender Portable guitar stand,positive
The only thing that would have been nicer and bumped the rating up would be to send a felt pad with the button I used a rubber washer I had and that worked very well It was easy to install Guitar Strap Button,positive
Ive been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10 years I have not had one fail on me ever Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure its on right Ive struggled with the C clip in the past but what are you going to do Its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie Reliable,positive
Good upgrade for my Squier Deluxe Strat Although note that if your pickguard isnt a Fender made brand the hole in the pickguard maybe a little small Not to worry All I did was took a drill bit the same size as the 34screw34 where the knob goes on and drilled the pickguard thus it fitting Over all nice purchase Awesome,positive
Its quality for a small price good if you are looking for a budget wires Overall it is good to buy its fine,neutral
its working great but it does not work in stereo It is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive its been woring great,positive
I bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well I like the thickness of this pick Easy to hang onto when strumming Love the tone I can obtain too Good one,positive
This Capo is inexpensive and works well Clips on easily and hold strings down nicely What more can I say Gotta keep it simple on this review because its a simple item Simply it does what its supposed to do for a low price I think it will last a while too but Ill probable misplace it before it breaks anyway so I have a few of these floating around You should have one of these in each gig bag Love this one,positive
This is everything you need in a record brush The bristles are the perfect quality and softness to get all the dust that sits between the lines of the record Highly recommended Affordable brushable,positive
The Snark SN8BSuper Tight All Instrument Tuner is the best Snark tuner Ive purchased of 4 models This SN8 has a matte type finish not glossy it has a gun metal black look to me which I prefer to the glossy finished models The dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold All Snark Tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand Best model yet,positive
It would be improper for me to claim that these FIT Stratocasters because I have a Stratocaster remake and I drilled new holes for a Stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in What I can say is that the packaging is nice and doesnt seem cheapo surprised it didnt come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag the size of the screws was right the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick and it came with more than enough to install a Stratocaster pickguard Im sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways Good product,positive
Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting Dampen the sponge squeeze out excess water insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp Couldnt be any easier I use them all winter long in my guitars Insurance Against Damage from Dryness,positive
As a freelancer I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest performing on a nearweekly basis These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet Its all about money to them I couldnt believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics even lowerpriced several years ago and insisting they were as good as Shure SM57s and 58s I still dont believe the quality of workmanship compares any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much But these Nadys handle the announcing the vocals and when needed the softer sounding instruments flute harmonica and none has broken or quit on my watchIm a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me Im only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the allimportant gear component At the same time my embarrassment I confess is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee After all whos playingand getting paid for it Good enough for professional use,positive
I didnt know how Pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps I was origianlly disappointed in the sound I was origianlly disappointed in the sound,neutral
These strings from DAddario are a personal favorite of mine I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use I think the light gauge is a nice size that wont hurt your fingers or put undue stress on your guitar Not only that but they sound great Not too big or not too small I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass I love how they color code their strings on the ball ends To me this makes it much easier when changing strings You dont have to worry about mixing up your strings Ive also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands Give these a try I think youll be satisfied A personal favorite,positive
These are by no means touring cases Theyre inexpensively made which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I dont tour That said they do a great job at protecting guitars that arent out on a stand Ive got about a dozen guitars and when theyre not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag These do very nicely for that purpose They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig but I wouldnt put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it So I recommend them but be aware of its limitations A great storage and gig case,positive
I sprayed on all my guitars No problem with any chemical reactions It polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new Now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice It must be from a product like this They seriously look brand new Makes nicks and scratches less noticeable If you want a nice looking guitar for the stage or display this stuff works Cleans,positive
These picks sound great very durable and grip is the best I have used My main complaint is the very small sizeI havent got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick I find the Dava master control more to my liking for most things but I still use the jazz IIIs from time to time when I just want a simple clean pick tone Great tone grip wish they were a bit bigger,positive
This strap is cool it is black made of nice material with gel padding and it Velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar Like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and Velcros Where I once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap now I feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever Adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar Get it if your strap isnt feeling good other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss This one is legit Easy to move between guitars feels great,positive
Fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder one of two new models the other for acoustic guitars Well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around Ideal for gigs as well as studio and home Solid performer Michael Haller Captain Souls Sound Circus Standup for Guitars,positive
This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over workI would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken wordI have many microphones and this compares to the 50 range mics Cant go wrong,positive
I use this soft flexible cable between my 48 volt phantom PS and the mic connector to my system because it need not be long to do its job No audible hum detected when using this mic cord either Feels solid and will probably last for many years to come Very nice cable,positive
Dont last but a couple weeksterrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks Crap,negative
I admit i was really just curious how good a 15 pedal could possibly be so i figured i would try one out I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago and remembered being satisfied with their stuff Anyway i figured since the pedal was so cheap why not try it outYou know it is a pretty decent stompbox The slap echo is a good enhancement effect meaning it isnt really over the topjust gives you a mellow reverbish echonot quite delay not quite reverbkind of somewhere in between I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different Not bad at all I cant speak to battery life though since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects For kicks try it out with some distortion andor overdrive and a wahAnywayEnjoy Decent enhancement pedal great price,positive
Not my favorite pick but pretty close they are solid and havent dropped one yetI wish someone would make a grippy texture pick with a hole in it too Nice pick I love the grip hole it really works,positive
I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars basses amps FX MIDI gear etc Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy noisy pots knobs input and output jacks that are crackly etcIn the past Ive tried some Locktite electronics cleaner which is provided in a similar can It would rarely workIn contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear Ive used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks Its really like magic in a can Its magic in a can,positive
I have a Blue Snowball mic and the stand that comes with that thing is entirely too short for my needs so I set out to find a deskstand for my microphone that I could use for podcasting and video work Here are my pros and consPros1 Its about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the Snowball This may be too tall for some with the mic put in it stands as tall as my 1734 ASUS G75VW but I have a raised desk so this fits right up to my mouth2 The Snowball screws right in unscrew the holder thing that comes on there screw the snowball in win3 After some research I found that this will fit pretty much any mic Cool4 It seems sturdy and well builtCons1 The legs make this thing very very wide Its about 23 the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space2 The mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird Not bad just weirdOverall this is highly recommended for a desk stand It seems to be able to fit just about any mic and its perfect for video voice overs and podcasts Really needed one of these,positive
These Planet Waves locking straps work very well on most guitars with standardsize strap pins Once locked theyre not going anywhere What you need to be careful about is that you have to use some common sense the locking end once fastened can act as a lever to pull the pin out of the guitar if pressure is put on it a certain way For this reason you would want to be careful when using it on acoustic hollow or semihollow guitars And I certainly wouldnt keep this strap on a guitar when its going to be carried in a gig bag Keeping this in mind these straps are an efficient inexpensive way to be sure your guitar wont break loose of its strap Great with a caveat,positive
Im not a metal player in any means but sometimes I do get the urge If your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 469 So I got these and they are awesome They are not too big or too small Very happy with these strings If you want GREAT strings get fender strings They are the best out there But for metal big strings I stick with ernie ball Great for metal,positive
I order 2 of these for my electric guitars They are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range The end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off They were VERY difficult to get on my guitar pegs not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure These are not coming off anytime soon They are wide enough but do not have any kind of shoulder pad I play sitting down so no big deal to me but if you play standing up these wont be the most comfortable straps All in all they are a decent strap for the price cheap and works,positive
Ive been playing guitar for 40 years This was my 1st decent classical guitar I own a Gibson Hummingbird and an Alvarez acoustic as well as electrics by most major manufacturers I like the fact that it has a truss rod which Ive already adjusted to improve the action The tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar The finish is pretty and I like the solid cedar top It records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models The case is nice as well So far Ive had no problems I bought new strings but havent replaced them yet The old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and 34alive34 Im sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound Nice Guitar,positive
Cheaply made but functional Keep a couple of these in the bag as sparesThey will be handy if you know who shows up to the gig without a strap Get this now,positive
No string expert here but these work great they stay in tune like I cant even believe actually thought someone was tuning my guitar it stays in tune so long Made in USA great quality sound and stay in tune,positive
Good strings They work and sound good I didnt notice much of a difference between these and runofthemill DAddario strings Good Strings,positive

Bought this cover to go with Behringer mic It does what its designed to do It was a little hard getting it onto the head of the mic but at least that way I know its not going to be falling off during a performance or a recording session Economical way to keep spit out of mic Does the job,positive
This a very clever idea It helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space Very easy to take offput on High recommend this to any stringedinstrument players Very nice product,positive

We have my grandpas really old Mandolin now so my dad and I wanted a nice case for our 70 year old mandolin I saw this case and thought that maybe it would work Well it works just fine the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes wellNow the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there It fits,positive
My son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass Jazz Band and his standup bass Chamber Orchestra It is solid yet flexible in height and angle Assembly was a breeze This is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use Built like a tank Should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family Possibly the Perfect Music Stand,positive
good strings Five Stars,positive
I had read many reviews on SM57 clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job It seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone The GLS ES57 Same with the SM 58ES58 I had to give it a shot I run the sound for local bands and I use SMs because they can take abuse and still sound great Only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far I really like it The frequency band is not identical to the SM57 as some others have said A little less bass but that doesnt mean it is a thin sound it certainly is not I can get it to sound the same as the SM if I EQ it slightly but I like the natural sound anyway Also the signal is a bit hotter but I really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments Value for money it cant be beat If you are on a budget get one Great value for money,positive
Just put these on my Martin DCX1E and they sound great This is a big guitar that really rings out and the Elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone Playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpickingI cant say if they last longer vine has us review this asap After daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning I have used Elixir nano web strings before and I do think they keep their tone a bit longer That being said my go to strings are still Daddario A Good Guitar Deserves Good Strings,positive
Great price for a carbon copy pedal Just buy it you wont regret it It beats spend gobs of cash that you could spend on other things Great price,positive
This guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble I have no complaints about this stand at all Nice Stand,positive
works out great for my two Ukus hung it on the wall looks good and is easy to adjust etc great,positive
I play steel guitar and add effects to the song and different ones to my solos Im always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs This is easily adjustable and adds a depth and a nearLeslie sound I use it often and it adds an interesting sound not possible with other effects Its easy to use in combination with for instance a Chorus or a Tremolo for dynamic steel guitar sounds Nice Leslie like effects,positive
Tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just OK to me It does need a hot signal going in to sound good so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups The distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static The EQ switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so I always have the tone in the circuit I used it with a vintage Vibrolux Reverb This is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal I am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me It is made well For the money I am not mad I tried it Meh,neutral
I own several Taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars I bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity too dry These are so easy to use and can be 34recharged34 if you feel like 1215 for 3 is too much every couple of months Ive successfully recharged these using distilled water about 3 times now and they work just as great as they did new These also come in a resealable package so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar caseYou can tell when theyve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling It means they need to be replacedTo recharge them I take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid big enough to hold 1 quart and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom Next I take a smaller empty ziplock container the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich and float it on the water in the larger container Then place the 3 packs in the floating container stacked on one another or on their sides and seal the top of the larger container with a lid It traps the humidity in the container and the membrane on these packs is twoway so they absorb it until they reach capacity again Keep the instrument humidified play it forever,positive
I havent read a lot of comments about these guys breaking so maybe my wife and I are just hamhanded Shrek wannabes but we have busted two of these little gizmos They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument a round frisbee shaped tuner and an arm that connects the two The arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into She and I have each busted one doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floorWhile the tuner works well otherwise except the low E string on a bass which can be problematic and the things dont cost very much its a shame we keep busting them I do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable Just be extra careful handling them Nice but easy to break,neutral
Good unit for the money for sure It is not road worthy however in our opinion Still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job Delivery packaging etc were very good Compact and does the job,positive
This is one of the best simple to use guitar tuners Ive used and Ive used a lot of them The bonus is that its also one of the least expensive that Ive seen You wont be disappointed Great little guitar tuner,positive
VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp As a bass player I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar I cant raise the volume above 1 in my house When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode the volume decreases dramatically but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionallyExcellent top quality features Beautiful sound for each of the different modes The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic The amp simulation is top notchAwesome value for the priceEdit Ive played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settingsIm even MORE impressed One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOMhuge sound I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group After experimenting more I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that bandI still cant get over the fact that it is a 40W amp The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage VERY impressed,positive
I got this because I was adding a Pedal to my practice amp This runs from my Guitar to the pedal Works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal This is actually my best cable and I think I will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these Guitar to pedal,positive
This product is easy to use without any noise at all I truly recommend it as a tuner pedal Im happy with this product This product is great Not a bit of noise,positive
The strap is strong and well made The color is perfect and with the pick pocket it makes for an easy place for picks to be stored I like it a lot Strong Strap,positive
This is a great capo from shubb The finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel I like how it works It adjusts to fit different guitar necks and just sort of snaps in place It doesnt require great force or a lot of hand strength to use this capo The rubber parts are replaceable and with a name like shubb you know youre getting a good product I recommend this capo to anyone One of the best capos,positive
I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music All of my 734 tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand Works for all my tablets,positive
8020 strings blend really well on my cheap Jasmine guitar They improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit Phosphor Bronze were way too bright on the Jasmine 8020 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out They did nothing to help my overbraced 1970 Gibson J50 though Phosphor Bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap Usual DAddario quality,positive
Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated I was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well Small but strong,positive

Solid stays where I put it and does a great job holding a heavy mic mount and pop filter Cant really beat it for the price Great for the price,positive
I recently bought this for my first electric guitar and I thoroughly enjoy it It has a lot of power and noise behind it It is a little starter amp just in case the picture was a little deceiving I cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion With distortion it sounds great It is a solid piece of work and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp Fun Amp,positive

Beautifully finished Everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable Nice sound in the acoustic too If this is an indicator of Indonesian made instruments then all string instruments should be made there Epiphone has outdone itself I absolutely adore this instrument I would love to have a Baritone Uku of this same design Precision Accuracy an a work of art,positive
For the money this is a great guitar case I bought it for a Silvertone SD10 which costs about 120 The guitar fits it fine I use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it I dont think I would take it on an airline They destroy luggage so I dont think it would fair well The compartment inside is large enough for picks strings capo and a strap with room to spare Mine opens and closes ok and the lock works It is well worth the 60 I paid for it Great Guitar Case for the Money,positive
This looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red continue playing When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish No need to line it up with the loop it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop If you dont like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub Want to stop and clear two presses and press and hold and your back to a clean slate I dont know the limit of overdubs but I havent reached it The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content The tone preservation is excellent and havent noticed any issues there You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it If I have something I like I then output it to Sonar to play with some morePros Small very easy to use 1 level knob and a stomp button designed by guitarists and it shows true bypass and plenty of room for recordingCons You may consider lack of battery a con I dont everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC No drum track or click track but then again the aim for this device was to keep is simple I believeUPDATE I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken replace at the store which I did It worked great then one night again I couldnt hear myself recording I played for about an hour with different configurations it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal Out of the 4 I have it only liked 2 When I used that adapter it seemed to work just fine So beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the 9V AC Adapter Best looper I have used in 30 years,positive
I bought this product to use on my amp pots It restored the soundpower and clearity of my ampsIt doesnt evaporate right away but after a couple of minutes your good to go Works well,positive
Great product with nice feel and tone Im only sorry I preordered only two sets at 1249 The average price now is 15 and over Ill bite the bullet and order more after I wear these two sets out Hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time I need new strings These are durable and long lasting Recommeded Excellent strings used on my Taylor,positive
works very well I have to of them each does a little different thing they are great for traveling or late night need to play stuff when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better the sound effects etc are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication great for those private moments,positive
great little tool to assist you while replacing strings cleaning or tuning keeps headstock still and then folds up neatly to fit in a drawer kit or pocket works great,positive
MXR make pretty good Pedals for the money I thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion It is not It has plent of Volume which is good for boosting But even with the Gain Knob turned all the way up this thing is an Overdrive Which is not a bad thing if thats what you are looking for Very MidRangey sound as well Just not for me But its well built and would make a decent OD But overall a pretty Vanilla flavored Dirt Pedal Beware of the title Distortion Its an Overdrive,neutral
This is a fine bag for a guitar I got it for my brotherIm not a music person but its good It is what it is,positive
Ive had it for almost 3 years now not a single problem Ive changed my setup like crazy sometimes even the cables had to be twisted in some certain position on a pedalboard Been bent on the edge of the cable right before the connector been pulled normal way and stomped never a single cut offs on the connectionDont worry too much about cables like a sissy bedroom princess guitarists youre using oddistortion pedals anyway right If youre a purist dont ever use a pedals or even electric guitar Good luck Get this snobs,positive
These are the same strings I paid much more for in my store The are the same as came on my Guitar Work and sound great Fender 3150 Strings,positive
This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over The stand can be used with or without the upper brace On mine the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as Id like it to be Also the 34feet34 dont spread as wide apart as Id hoped A few more inches would have been appreciated All in all a good but not 34perfect34 stand Good stand,positive
this pedal is well made plastic but w great electronics made designed by german mind it sounds like a chorus and vibrate at once wave tone and quiet w true bypass on bord great pedal for the money get it its worth it for guitar bass or keys cisco2fun1youtubecom,positive
I have large hands I wear an XXL glove but I guess not thick fingers Ring Size 1213 If you want to use this one on your ring finger consider getting a smaller sizeAs for the tone of the slide it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass Heavy Feel but very large,positive
Best recorder for the money Ive seenEasy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settingsThe nearest competitor to this is slightly slimmer witch to me would not be a plus because I dont use this on a camera rigThe picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually isCheck out the youtube vids on it i believe it to be more versatile than its competition and the build quality is higher as wellThe only thing the other has on this one is its size What an awesome little recorder,positive
I have one of these in every one of my guitar cases You never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper Cutter winder and pin puller Gets the job done and it is inexpensive Put one in your guitar case,positive
I bought this for my 1974 Martin D18 for recording on my PC So far it is working great I have a Behringer 802 mixer already and I just plugged the guitar into that It works perfectly This guitar is very loud without a pickup but to get the sound into my PC for recording I either needed to use a mike or a pickup I chose the pickup I got too much background noise with the mikeUpdate I started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out I had played my guitar about an hour before without that buzz being a problem I discovered that if I turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away Then I remembered that the only thing I was doing differently was that I had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside I turned that light off and the buzz went away My pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light Im glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup After using the pickup for awhile I have noticed that the 5th and 6th strings arent as loud as I would expect also the 2nd string is louder than all of the strings Im not sure why Its not a big deal Just What I Needed,positive
In the reviews for this item there seems to be a lot of debate over what the Fender Mini Tone Master is and how we should evaluate it Is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier Do we review it compared only to other mini amps or do other small combos costing under 100 creep into the discussion Well I bought one for myself and the conclusion is this It isnt the best way to practice guitar quietly at home but its also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than youd expectAPPEARANCEDURABILITY Actually the aesthetics of the Mini Tone Master are one of my favorite things about it This is a 40 conversation piece that I wouldnt mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies It just so happens that its a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also The component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap yet are put together in a convincing way Take a step back and youd swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather The grill cloth over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers Actually while the amp is cheap its also fairly durable In fact I just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review and it seems to be working fine Phew It should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a 9V battery or a 9V DC adapter a BOSS pedal supply adapter will work for example While the battery option is obviously nice for portability the red ON light seemed noticeably dimmer with 9Vs and I cant say how long the battery will last If you plan to have it in one place most of the time the adapter is the preferred way to goSOUND The concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it a one watt output with TWIN 2 speakers Given that each speaker is smaller than the tweeter on a large stereo speaker you wont be surprised at all to hear that theres virtually no bass in the sound It sounds like a poor 10W solid state amp only shrunk down to a few inches At the same time thats kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier and it puts out a fair amount of sound I opted for the Mini Tone Master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones Low GainHigh Volume produces pretty good clean tones and with humbuckers and the gain turned up it can get a bit raunchy Unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally I havent figured out which yet I had it at 5 most of the time but it didnt seem to cut much treble as I turned it up Actually it got the brightest around 7 and then almost became more muffled beyond that But again for a 40 mini amp my expectations were not that much to begin with I do like the four knobs and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an onoff flat toy switchI expected the speaker to overdrivebreak up if you pushed it too hard and not in a tubelike manner That wasnt necessarily the case but there are other problems Something internally rattles after the volume goes above 4 and its not the speaker being overpowered This is a common issue with cheap amps and I might even pop it open to see what is rattling around And the sound quality isnt objectively good by any means but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing styleALTERNATIVES The primary reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 really isnt any of the issues above I am happy with the amp but its limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for homequiet practicing My favorite of these by far are the Vox Amplugs which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers The sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality and volumefullness than anything this mini amp could do Also they are offered at 40 or 50 so its simply a better value Another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software While sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps the possibilities for effects modeling and recording are endlessIf you think about recent improvements in small size Bluetooth speakers you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the Mini Tone Master offers At the same time those speakers can cost up to 200 and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp Your opinion of it will depend on your expectations but if you dont take it too seriously its a cool little device And in my book anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at Cool novelty item that happens to be a halfway decent miniamp,positive
I think these are great for the price they give you John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these Always using these picks,positive
Ive owned just about every muff No Triangle or Civil War But this is my favorite muff thus far Way more versatile than any other muff The switches involment in the the circuit really isnt too elaborate but then again all bypasses arent I love wicker on and tone off Cuts like a buffalo I hate to have a bunch of fuzzs and distortions in my chain but its there right next to a Keeley Fuzz Head a Analogman Peppermint Fuzz and a TS9 modded to an 808 w Brown that I modded myself I love this Muff I cant wait to see what they do next Plus These new EHX pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass If you like muffs youll really like this one If you didnt like muffs before youll probably like the wicker feature it makes it far more clear and pronounced and less of a glob a goo and more distortion fuzz friendly I give it four stars because the five is only meant meant for devices that you just freak out and half to have for me the Keeley Fuzz Head is a five I love that thing Funnest Muff,positive
Great price for 12 picks spanning from light heavyPicks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks Great Picks,positive

These headphones are 100 amazing I could not believe the sound quality I have been an audio engineer for over 30 years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth 200300nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price no I do not work for Tascam the first pair I bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easilyso I ordered another pair because the sound is amazing I just need to be more careful next timebut this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and constructionI have yanked my Senhiesers millions of times and the cord never broke so be careful with the cord on this headphoneit is not the best but the sound is superior amazing,positive

Bought this Hosa Pedal Cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal It works well and seems to be durable It hasnt given him any problems so far It doesnt appear to change the sound quality or tone Great product Great Durable Pedal Cable,positive
Consider the distortion sound of Cream the Doors and ZZ top That buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does Unfortunately thats about all it does However if you want to have the perfect break on through guitar intro sound this is absolutely the pedal for you Qualitywise its awesome and if I needed that sound I would definitely own one again I got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions and honestly I havent missed it because Im not in a Doors cover band or anything Great for one type of sound,positive
Easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments For the price I am very pleased Works well,positive
I use my Shure SM7B mainly for podcasting and voice work and it performs extremely well in those applications I also use aHeil PR40 Dynamic Studio Recording Microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item Both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm natural feelOne thing well actually two things the Shure SM7B has that the Heil PR40 does not is a set of two switches One for bass rolloff and one for midrange emphasis presence boost While both of these switches can be useful I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing EQ handle adjustments that need to be done If you dont have outboard processing both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises for example someone bumping the table to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit betterWhen I reviewed the Heil PR40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit While the PR40 is about 7000 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR40 users will want to use a shockmount about 100 and pop filter windscreen 15 60 to get the best results out of the microphone With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens one for normal use and one for ultraclose up use with the microphone So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the HeilAnother thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any offaxis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applicationsThe SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR40 so youll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer preamp that can handle the microphoneThe bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it If youre comparing it to the Heil PR40 most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very very close The Shure SM7B Is In The Top Class Of Voice Over Podcast Microphones,positive
Hm I received this I opened this Ive used it I also use it This product seems to be a pretty good product On Stage Foam Ball Mic Windscreen,positive
Not the greatest pedal Gives a really broken sound There is no mid way on this pedal either It seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing The octave is a joke Having said all that I could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance Has its place its meh,neutral
I was very skeptical about this mic being so cheap and all but I use it in my band with several other Shure mics and I cant tell the difference the same pa mix and they sound the sameI plan on getting a few more of these For the money this really delivers,positive
This is a very useful and quite educational musicians piece I especially like the way it is presented and how easy it is to use It easily helps remember all possible scales and shows many tricks for your musical compositions Highly recommended Cheers Very useful and quite educational,positive
Ive only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say after researching condenser microphones for several months countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars moreHeres another interesting fact I thought the 34King of all Media34 Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig well I found out he uses a 990 as well So think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional and under 100 dollars Incredible You WONT be disappointed on this buy An astounding microphone and incredible value,positive
Unless you know what youre doing these things are too small If you feel comfortable with your picking skills the size and stiffness along with the built in grip are pretty good These are for lead and not rhythm The picture wont show it but they are about the size of a dime For lead and not rhythm,positive
Takes you hours to play around with all the sounds Built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage Nice and loud in a small package Variety and customizable,positive
This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne The only issue I have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post not a big deal Game of Thrones,positive
Against most educated and experienced advice from many blogs I installed one of these in my 1972 Twin Reverb 100 watt The original speakers are too HiFi sounding for meThey hurt my ears so clean This speaker has all the range and a little bonus sizzle to boot but in a round full musical way Again to those who may like to tread in my ill advised path these are 50 watt speakers the Twin Reverb is 100 watts Right now I have the CR and one original speaker running in my TR Ill get another CR if this one holds up okay But Im in a band that plays small rooms a lot so I dont crank it past 45 very often Ill post an update if this speaker fails But at least on an initial run Im glad I bought itRock And Roll Forever Better than expected,positive
I have a 1993 Taylor which is in mint condition I always use Martin on any acoustic I bought the Taylor about 6 months ago and have found that the Medium Martin Strings are best for this particular guitar every acoustic is different though The Best,positive
I already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well It was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where I need it Holds Zoom recorder as well with no issues when I am recording This works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod Hold HD Camera and Zoom H4n Well,positive
A big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass Seems sturdy enough I side on safety so I use a soft cloth for extra protection but this item does what it was designed to and should last a long time Works Great,positive
I love the Snark tuners but dont know that Id call it super tight or faster than the older SN2 I feel the display is an improvement easy on the eyes Hopefully more reliable than SN2 Ive had pixels dropping out on one SN2 that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine Too soon to tell if the SN8 will hang in thereI dont see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an SG Dont know why as it works fine with acoustics and Strat Response time on the SG is longer than the older SN2 model but I havent yet tried to understand whats going on with it Havet tried it on bass yet but I know that the SN2 didnt play well with the E string open No big deal I just tune it at 12th fret Could choose any note since its chromatic Speaking of which playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the Snark Tune any string to match the song and then tune the other strings with the same displayed errorBottom line is that its a great tuner and its not likely that Ill get much use out of the old Korg tuner that once balanced on my knee I Love These Things,positive
I will no longer use other humidifying methods for my BR243A Theres too much that can go wrong with over or under humidifying a solid wood acoustic guitar Woods swell and shrink based on moisture vapor and it can also affect the tone qualityThe beauty of these is that the gel packs maintain consistent humidity and make any changes gradually It just works,positive
Bought these for my sons electric guitar He loves this brand They sound great and seem to last longer than other brands Price is great Elixir Electric Guitar Strings 6String Medium NANOWEB Coating,positive
I typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars they work very well for my needs however I bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i dont care what happens to the gear This strap is perfect for those needs A nice nylon and the lock works wellBUTthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons It works on the bass i use it on but not my Gibson SG so be aware I would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap A nice substitute for straplocks sort of,positive
I seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed ive been playing guitar for like 5 years These picks are the BOMB they dont break on you when you strum too hardfast D i would rate this product 6 stars if i could im completely satisfied with these picksTip These picks are great for HIGH ACTIONHIGH GAIN GUITAR SOLOS Such a wonderful pick,positive
This works perfect with the quick release system I also purchased I mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap It also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare or want to put it away without loosing it Needed an inexpensive strap that would hold an extra pick,positive
It arrived I plugged it in already had a battery in it Both knobs at 12 oclock toggle in middle didnt change the internal switches BAM Guitar sounds alive No more weak notes the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power No compressor pumping very minimal noise compressors by nature are noisy It just make the guitar sound better even and stronger Compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound This pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality If you play crystal clear you HAVE to have this pedal Driven full distortion it adds sustain Im Sold Now I may just have to get the SL drive also by xotic look it up on youtube Incredible out of the box,positive
Very nice smooth no sharp edges not much bigger than the picks its holding it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks the only issue is the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top is a little too strong and was warping my thin picks but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile and its fine Best one Ive stumbled across in my 45 years of guitar playing,positive
These have been my favorite pick for years now but I must say that they are not real pointy and I have recently been trying some pointier pick and Im now on the fence Love these pick,positive
I am a tone freak I bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff At the time i had never owned a big muff I thought the sound it produced was big muff sound I later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff The difference was huge The big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box I later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging I am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal I would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space Sounds like a muff but theres a good reason why its cheaper,negative
it is more than I hoped for Very nice protection for my Luna it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat Fits like a glove,positive
I got this little guy for my spider IV 15 for all the awesome features and it works flawlessly Channel switching is a breeze with almost no delay The tuner works great as well I tuned it on there then with my korg tuner and it matches up The wah volume pedal is very useful too vol is good for fade ins or fade outs The amount of force needed to switch to wah is quite a bit and seems like its a little too much force thats needed but it works And once youre switched over to the wah dont expect to match up with Voodo Chile or Bulls On Parade Its good but doesnt really cut it if you want a great wah sound Overall though its a good buy for your line 6 amp Great pedal to have,positive
I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want1 Boss digital delay I really didnt like the sound of the delay overall No real positives to mention2 Carbon copy analog delay Worked great for cleans But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone even though it was in my fx loop I couldnt get the repeats to duck under the main signal3 Nova Delay I really wanted to like this Presets tap tempo and a nice feature set But the sound just lacked warmth It was very digital soundingAt this point I wasnt sure what I wanted Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy Digital delays were clear sounding but just too digital and uninspiringI was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline when I found this pedal Analog dry signal thru with digital delay This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect Sure it doesnt have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay this cant be beat at this price rangeSure enough when I checked the strymon timeline specs I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set But 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for meBuy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed Skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc The search for a delay pedal ends,positive
Small footprint simple to use one button one knob and does not suck tone out of my guitar Its only got a basic feature set but thats all I need Reasonable price too Highly recommended Great little looper,positive
My first reaction on opening the box that this came in was 34Gee its a lot smaller than I expected34 It looks like a CAD Equitek E100S but its a fraction of the size Id even say it was cute But how does it performI have two microphones I use for recording at my computer A Blue Yeti USB electret mic and a Sampson SAMTR101A Of the two the Yeti is closer in design as it uses an electret capsule and a builtin USB interface like the Go Mic so thats what I compared it to I fired up Garage Band and plugged both microphones into the computer a four year old iMac so I could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks with acoustic guitar ukulele and double bassRight off the bat I was impressed with the Go Mics lack of latency it was as good as the Yeti maybe better There was no perceptible delay No need to find a special driver either Plug it in and its ready to go Theres even a headphone jack in the mic something unusual in a package this tiny Sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the Yeti I tried all three modes Carodid Carodid 10bD pad and Omni Omni gave the best clearest sound not unexpectedly but it was hard to get a good level when close miking No matter how I backed down the volume in Garage Band I got clipping Using the 10dB pad I was able to get some acceptable levels from a few feet away Best sound on all instruments was obtained from 610 feet using the Omni modeIt has one advantage over the Yeti Its very modest in current requirements so I can run it directly off my iPad The two together make a nice portable recordingproduction combination Packaging is well thought out too The mic is permanently attached via a swivel to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection And if thats not enough theres a separate case to keep dust and dirt out of the micWhile the Go Mic wouldnt be my first choice for recording music it would be a very acceptable one for recording musical ideas on the go and perfectly acceptable for voice recording podcasting or Skyping Tiny but capable,positive
Our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords He has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses It looks very stylish and functional as well Great Pedal Board,positive

I dont know if its me but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on i use this for booster really sounds good use it too when i want to get feedback from my ampalso it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedali recomend this one I like this but,positive
for something but not a guitar Wasnt sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook or notepad computer so I can follow a recipe It seems to work okay for that Just dont use this for guitars An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far and the arms have no grip This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project It may even give you AIDS But probably not However animals could have been harmed in the making But most likely and in reality it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner Great Mount,negative
Ive bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years and Ive paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones and this is the best one Ive found yet Very sturdy well made and fully height adjustable with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged so at least it lets you know that ahead of timemost cheap stands dont so thats a good thing as well Dont waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand grab this one The best stand on Amazon at the best price,positive
The coversion cable didnt work t is axlr to UBS cable I have the red blinking light syndrome also But I learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for Send it back So izm Thanks HDE for wasting my time Go sell your snake oil to someone else I hate it,negative
This is a great stand and highly adjustable Can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall There was a review I read with negative comments about the design claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off Nonsense There are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rocksolid Because its lightweight and portable I could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height But this is a GREAT stand Excellent stand,positive

the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners I have found I have both the the SN1 and SN2 for my guitar and mandolin respectively when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on if not sure which get the SN2 red one it generally will work for all instruments excellent tuner,positive
I hate spending 13 bucks on a couple little pieces of hardware that probably cost 13 cents to make but its better than the 20 bucks local music shops want for this same set Overall they work really well and look sharp They fit perfectly on my Schecter Hellraiser Very happy with my purchase Good Product Fit Schecter Hellraiser Perfectly,positive
Its the Tube Screamer of delay pedals I use mine primarily to thicken up my tone and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board I have used it for situations that call for deep delay and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey I fall back on a EHX Memory Man chained to an Anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the 2 delays in experimentation sequences but when playing blues or thrash I use it as tone beef only Low settings not too echoey more like a bassd out reverbThere are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal and it is a testament to its versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genresHey stop reading this and order it Now Every Board Needs One,positive
As usual an excellent Zoom productAdds to my playing Just love this thing Not too difficult to get the hang of Even for me Great,positive

This was something I HAD to pick up simply due to the price I own a Shure SM57 and compared to this the sound is very close not dead on but Id consider this over other mics for someone on a budgetThe top does not spin like the Shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost Im sure but none the less it makes no difference sound wiseOverall a great buy Shocking,positive
This is supposed to be an Fulltone OCD clone but to me it sounds a bit better than the OCD and worseHas more low end and a smoother mid that the OCD Thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the OCD that may not be a good thing though depending on your tasteIf I turn the gain up past 9 oclock the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive and kills the dynamicsThats a good thing and bad as I like a fuzz tone but thats not what I bought the pedal forOverall I can live with it its well built sounds good and the price is unbeatable Better than expected,positive
Es el output original de fender que mas se puede decir producto de calidad me gusto Saludos a todos desde Venezuela Original fender,positive
This does a fine job of cutting even a thick E bass string Very pleased Also works to cut ukulele strings Hooray hooray hooray Bargain priced and works great,positive
Ive seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but Ive never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one It is by far the best Ive ever seen and Ive been using it for years now and it still works fine It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesnt corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these yearsVery highly recommended The Best Capo Ive Ever Used,positive
The tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks It may be my imagination but I think the recent ones work a little differently than previous generations They seem to register differently than older ones and sometimes give you a tuning that is just a wee bit sharpI have used them to tune many different kinds of string instruments from autoharps to mandolins to guitars It works with all of themTuning by vibration is very useful in a loud room but it is not always perfect If another band is playing loudly the sound vibrations from the speakers will affect your ability to tune So you have to wait until the band is between songs to get an accurate readingTo my taste the display on these SN2s is the best of all the Snarks I like the extra bars and the smoothness of the way the display zeroes in to the perfect pitch It looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changesFinally do not drop these The head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily It has a ball joint construction That is good and seems to hold up to use The plastic socket however on the back of the tuning head does not respond well to hitting the floor even a carpeted floor I do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them When you do 6 out of 10 times the plastic socket will break I have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base They still tune but I have to hold them against the guitar They do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient Dont Drop Them,positive
Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me my guitar and my soundIm a 62 YO newby to guitar This proves that easy helps I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place got Martins installed wow did they make a baddiference to me Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play My friend said that he uses DAddario and that they make ALL the difference in the world Tried them and he was right I changed my own on the big Baby and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did MY Taylor recommends Elixr but the DAddarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers Great Choice,positive
I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for rework I just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them I immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings Ive ever played what exactly are they I might experiment with the EXP15s but by and large these EXPs are my new strings Pleasant surprise,positive
This is a great addition to any stereo system today assuming you still use your turntable Two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play free of any annoying pops or clicks It wont save a dirty record youll have to buy a cleaning solution for that but this brush will easily take care of dust hair and other particles that get attracted to your LPs during regular use As another reviewer suggested I do the first pass with the brush going with the record as if I was spreading out paint or something like that and that gets most of the surface particulate free The second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record After that your record will sound brand new againThere are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options but none that are this easy and this cheap Great accessory for the budding audiophile,positive
Used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older Strattype guitar and it sounds great The diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original Chinese pot so I needed a cheap reamer purchased through Amazon to enlarge the pickguard hole Its a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness nice big lugs to solder to A perfect replacement volume pot,positive

This little amp is amazing Its loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps AND you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp I love it If you need a practice amp and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private then this is the amp you should buy The price is right and the size is right Enough said Buy it Great little amp,positive
I found this to be very inaccurate but only on a few strings so adjustment is not possible I bought this because of the newer features I like the strum see which strings were out function but what good are nice features if the main function of the tuner is inaccurate Its not a bad tuner seems well built but unless you play so poorly or loud that tuning precision doesnt matter Id go with the Korg Pitch Black which is what I was using in my home studio well back to what worked Not Impressed At All,neutral
I used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele Its attractive Its well made Its fork is a tad large for the ukulele It has rubber orings that slide so I can bring them in and the uke does fit then But then even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase or wall if you use it there The uke hits when I put it in the hanger so I put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcaseMany uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners This is much less expensive holds very well is even more low profile than this hanger and never drops a uke Consider it for your needsId not buy another of these for a ukulele It likely works fine for a guitar thoughI deducted one point for the fact that even though its adjustable the orings and advertised for ukes it doesnt work well for them And its heavy and not stylish in my opinion I have the Hercules wall hanger mechanical gripper for my electric guitars and its fabulous for guitars overkill for lightweight ukuleles maybeHercules Stands Wallmount Guitar Hanger GSP39WBUpdate 9711 the more I use it the less I like it I find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune So for small instruments youd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos this is atrocious For guitars its not as good as Hercules Ukulele too large fork plus update,neutral
Personally I just love the DAddario strings They sute my needs just right for the Takamine acoustic Great quality and price love these strings,positive
Ive had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap durable and reasonably accurate I own several different tuners and what I like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar Batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it At ten dollars I think its a nobrainer Its the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own A five star product at this price point,positive
I requested this for Christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it Ive used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great First I used it to treat clean fingerboards that were in good shape and it worked well It can even make a big improvement to the dry porous surface of a cheap fretboard and good rosewood fingerboards love the stuffLater on I got some used guitars and used cleaned the gunky fingerboards with Guitar Honey apply it scrub with toothbrush wipe with paper towel repeat and it did a lot better than I expected at removing the yucky buildup next to the fretsI like to apply it fairly heavily and lay the guitar down with the fingerboard level and facing up and give it time to soak in You will notice that some areas soak it more than others I move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly Then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and youre ready to goWhen I wipe down the strings after playing the first time or two after treating with Guitar Honey the rag shows dark lines where the Guitar Honey cleaned the strings I like making my strings last longerGet some I dont think youll regret it Cleans and Conditions Strings and Fretboard Long Lasting,positive

Comes with all the Velcro you can need Very simple to set up even for me a newbieI got the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 to go along with it Although you have to drill 4 holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple Great,positive
If the hiss from your distortion and compression pedals irritates you this is worth the money Contrary to the name it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer It does not filter out noise but rather stops the signal to the amp entirely when the sound from the instrument reaches a predetermined minimum If you are playing with humbuckers your only problem will be pedal hiss and you will never hear it again If you are playing on single coils the hum while you play is so minimally noticeable that this is still worthwhile Whether youre gigging and dont want to sound like an amateur or youre practicing in headphones at 4am this will make your playing sound a little better and you cant complain about that No more annoying pedal hiss,positive
Its a Fender Heavy so theres not much else to say about that Good price and selection here Go for it Good price,positive
Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settingsThink Alice in chains or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo admittedly not everyones into the whole grunge tone But it was what I was looking forHas some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings tooAnd hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change Great value good pedal,positive

good tone but dicey controls Like the features especially the noise gate but do not use the scoop very much good tone,positive
Great sound works just like a phaser should I have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds I use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect Cool pedal solid construction Only thing is that it is big One other thing it works better if you put it in front I found that in the effects loop it does not work so great Great pedal,positive
Switches channels on my Mustang II like a charm Would have received a 5star rating had it been in a metal enclosure It is plastic but it suits my needs Fender Footswitch,positive
i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from there is no difference in the sound at all this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in a boxit does 80s hair band and 80s metal very wellif youre looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic 34plexi34 or 34brown34 sound get the joyo british it nails those sounds well clone of the mi audio crunch box,positive
After 35 years of buying stands all I can say is that I should have invented it myself I have many expensive guitars and I wouldnt use a inexpensive stand before I found this design So if youre shopping and wonder if its really good you can trust me because Im way over qualified to pass judgement on this and I care about guitars and about Amazon shoppers Its The Best Design,positive
I bought this power supply for in home use I dont do too much gigging or recording so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around The product works very well Im able to power 5 of my pedals easily The cords are plenty long in length however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other ie having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal However that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product I havent had to use any of the special adapters though but I plan on getting a Line 6 DL4 so having the Line 6 adapter is a great added touch Best of all all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home Ive been using this product for months now and have no complaints You cant beat the price Great power supply for multiple effects,positive
Do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit That said for the price it is an excellent product Obviously if you are looking for a studio quality mic you would not be here This product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations For a normal use this is quite good Feels little tiny but excellent gain I would buy it again if required For the price it is an excellent product,positive
Yes I bought 3 and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bassVery easy to install on the wall nice looking and robust instruments hanger,positive
Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone so for the price and in the past I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets no consistency in quality example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item Also some had bright white lettering and others did not but where not vintage lettering either Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC onWill try other brands next time Inconsistent sets probably no QC for these,negative
This seems to have been a rare case but still i had my ukulele on is and it snapped Im worried what might happen with a guitar or a bass The top fell off,negative
I received all twelve picks which came in a small ziploc bag with an attached Fender tag The color is great I needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic These work great though do not offer as warm a sound as rubber or felt picks I find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber The picks were reasonably priced and shipped via prime so I found them to be a great value as someone who only plays casually ThanksSPO Thin Purple Moto picks,positive
These are the best strings Ive ever put on my guitar I play a really nice Morgan Monroe Creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves The bright highs the rich mids and they bend like crazy when I need them too wont use anything else,positive
I bought these and used them for a week before giving my reviewIf Amazon used halfstars I would have given them 355 I just couldnt bring myself to give them a 45 so I went with 35 heres whyIve used standard medium picks for over 20 years Switching to these was not a problem at all Sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems By far the biggest change was the 34pointyness34 of the picks The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing especially when playing chords Everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion Its especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strummingIf someone was to ask me if these are good picks my answer would be 34it depends34 It really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing From a rhythm standpoint I dont like these at all they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come throughCould I play faster with them No Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldnt do with my normal picks NoI tried them but didnt like them Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work constantly these would be the way to go I dont and they arent for me Im glad I tried them though because Ill never wonder again if they were for me Depends on what youre playing,neutral
Ive had this little amplifier for a few weeks and I couldnt ask for a better practice amp Its amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room but itll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds Its rugged and portable and its fun to play around with some of the effects The fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus Exactly as advertised,positive
Absolutely no complaints about these cables We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats and were very happy with the sound quality for our use The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guidescovers and provide good strain relief For the price theres no worry about solder quality since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cableWe also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound qualityGreat for short connections for mixers or straight to the ampSpecs 10 14 mono tip Excellent Quality Great sound,positive
This is the 1 mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructiblelooking forward to work with it on future projects cant believe it took me so long to get one of those This is the best f mic ever,positive
This harmonica is great for beginners or professionals I know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones Highly recommended Plays sounds feels and looks great Also comes with a little note sheet Great,positive
This is my third pack the 1st pack has been using for two months the sounds are rich and full and the feels are still good I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time So I want to keep a completed pack for back up I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently sometime i will practice for 45 hours until im tired for the session I have used light steel strings on my acoustic but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter My Third Pack,positive
A bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews Plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see It has tons of gain on tap it responds well to the guitars volume knob it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal loveThe pedal cuts through and is articulate Its not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock Think ACDC and Van Halen to Metallica Its a classic rock pedal that screamsBuy it Perfect Plexi Style Gain,positive
This microphone in just a few words IS AWESOME The sound recorded by this device in all modes left nothing to be desired for me I use this mic for voice over work that gets added to videos playing in major hotel rooms Superior mic Short and Sweet,positive
I share most of the same sentimentsThe pads are a little stiff but this works does the job and is such a small packageFits in my Macbook bag Still glad I bought it,positive
I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price but pleasantly surprised when we received it Great price and excellent construction Shopped around at local music shop to expensive,positive
No moving parts No high tech components The ultimate in low tech Its a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose I find this size useful but I guess it depends on the individuals needs Enough said Its a rubber stamp,positive
This guitar strap performs as expected for its price Great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started or for a backup strap Very nice basic guitar strap,positive
I seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and I have great access to it Fantastic I love it,positive
Having purchased many 34A34 frame and more 34traditional34 style stands this one has quickly become my favorite Not only is the padding much better than the rest of them this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work Only thing lacking a bit is the instructions but its easy enough to put together that they arent really needed Ill probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon Most solid stand Ive purchased,positive
I just got these to collect not to use to play with They look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff not a playing pick,positive
This is a great stand for your violin or viola I use it all the time and I feel that my violin is very safe in it at gigs Ingles adjustable stand for Violin or Viola,positive
Theres no substitute for the right part These are great I like having extras around just in case I rescue another orphaned guitar to rebuild The springs are almost always missing Cost less here than at Guitar Center so badabing well theyre springy,positive
I bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project I can say that it worked amazingly well for this and did an excellent job at recording the bands without any distortion or excessive noise The recorder stores two files at the same time one being a file at your chosen sensitivity and another safety track at a lower level in case there are any clipping issues with your main recording This accounts for quick transients or anything that might cause the recorder to overload and ensures that you will get a good takeThe microphones can be folded out to extend the stereo field or in to tighten the field In addition you can use external microphones or XLR inputs for professionallevel input from the soundboard I found that the internal microphones did a wonderful job of reproducing the audience experience and I cant say enough good things about the performance This is an absolutely wonderful recorderBottom line Highly recommended EXCELLENT recorder,positive
Wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh Some people pay for silver and expect gold Okay so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard P hard T hard B S and a few others So I got this Here are my pros and consPros1 It works I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter The pop sound is completely removed with the filter Which means it does what it was designed to do 5stars It does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech D2 It looks nice Attached to my Blue Snowball it looks like a professional product It doesnt really matter since I work from home and not in a public place but its nice to know I can show it to people and it looks nice3 The clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface So mounting this to say a desk probably wont be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic4 I dont know why people think this isnt sturdyI mean youre not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing The build quality is quite excellent considering that its 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metalCons1 Its pretty big I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage I cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it Now its become a permanent member of the front of my deskOutside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up I have no complaints about this pop filter It works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time Good for Home Use,positive
I look at many stands before I brought this one the rating were great and Im very pleased with the purchase If I need another stand I will buy this one again with no hesitation Great stand,positive
Ok its cheap You knew that when you bought it I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture It was only one and it was red Broke with first use Cheap cheap,negative
I am a beginner guitar player so I dont have too much experience with different types of strings But I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar these things are like night and day A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers Highly recommended Great Strings,positive

Great cord for the money Works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for Christmas Will buy more in future Cool cord,positive
The Seller shipped very fast and I give them 5 plus stars this review is regarding the actual productThe Behring US600 is a basic pitch shifter dont expect elaborate effectsMade of plastic not as sturdy as a BOSS pedalGoes through 9V batteries quickly so stock upIf you use an AC adapter get a hum eliminatorCurse you 60 cycleAlso run the US600 AFTER the distortion for optimum performanceOther wise you are shifting the clean signalDistortion pitch shifter chorus then outThis pedal gives you a sweet 12string chorus sound and that alone is worth the 45 bones The dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there Dont expect a 2 octave bottom because it doesnt do thatYou will not sound like a Thin Lizzy dual guitar lead but you can get that Bryan May Queensryche meets the Allman Brothers harmonies in 3rdsFor those on a budget this pedal does what it doesnt advertiseLacks true instructions so go to YouTube and watch demos Inexpensive alternative to harmony effects,neutral
This is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their musicspeeches It is easily mounted on the Mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs I would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand I am using it with my Samsung tablet and can also be used with my wifes Toshiba tablet Highly recommended Microphone Stand Tablet Mount,positive
bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488Ive been using the mxl990 mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of i still recommend the mic though it is hotter than the 990in its highs but with good compression power amp and eq the result is well worth the money 1st one produced static but sounds good,neutral
I own alot of MXR pedals and this one is one of my favorites This is one of the top delay pedals the pros use It is super simple to use Regen is how many repeats you want Delay is how long you want the delay to be and the Mix is basically how loud you want delay to be in your mix You can get all the great delays out of this one pedal From Aint Talkin Bout Love to the Randy Rhoads solos of the 80s There is also a little MOD button which seems to add some depth to the pedal really makes it seem a bit fuller I like that feature alot Awesome Delay Pedal,positive
Sturdily holds three guitars Fits everything from my bass to the acoustic or electrics to the mandolinukulele to the harmonicas in the caseFolds up for transport Pretty adjustable tooI bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules I also have the trombone and saxclarinet stand from them All A at reasonable prices Best stand I own,positive
This has more features than Ill ever likely use Has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer Appears to be well made Well worth the price,positive
Very authentic sound reproduction Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear The threaded end is holed so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock Youll never get your arm in there far enough LOLYou will need a 1532nd drill bit to complete the install Awesome,positive
I bought another heavy LP guitar recently and thought Im going to use Fender leather strap I bought in Target a while ago not sure why i never buy guitar stuff there it looks good then Well you get what you pay for leather looking paper wouldnt hold guitar So I gave it a chance and bough this on and it seems like this strap holding well Ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly It still not too wide to play for few hours but for that you have to buy 30 one So this one works well for the price Good strap for the price,positive
I gave it 4 stars because it is well made and it does the job it is designed to do But I personally do not like how it looks of it when installed But that is only a personal opinion You may see it differently Dont use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase It does what it was made to do I purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap Does the Job,positive
Ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all I have average size hands and thumbs and the pick initially numbed my thumb in about twenty seconds it was so tight I solved the problem by simply holding a Bic lighter flame about a half inch away from the heel of the pick for just about three seconds I could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly It was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit Its actually easy to completely customize the size and shape of the picks with just a few seconds of heat The picks fit fine now and I didnt even need to place 34foreign34 objects into the microwave to do itAny questions just feel free to ask and I will answer best I can ThanksSPO Decent picks easily adjustable,positive
Works like its supposed to No complaints at all for the price I will be buying more in the future Perfect,positive
As my reviews demonstrate Im a sucker for a new tuner Peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners Id even tried one once but decided it wasnt the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams So when I saw that Peterson had introduced a clip on tuner I couldnt help but salivateAwkward is a relative term but I dont feel its a disservice to use it here The typical clipon tuner has an LCD needle When the needle is dead center the string is tuner If its short of center the string is flat If its past center the string is sharp The SC1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate analogous to what a strobe might look like A string is in tune when the rings stop rotating I found that with the way the sound of strings decays its difficult to get the rings to stop spinning even in the SC1s sustain mode Ive already returned the tuner Otherwise I just realized it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the SC1 and with a Zoid or IntelliThe SC1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars However when I tuned my loungingathome guitar this way I found the needle was dead center on every string on my Intelli tuner For those whove read my other reviews my preferred Zoid was in the case with my favorite guitarIt may well be and others may report that the SC1s feature set make it ideal for other situations However if you main purpose is to keep a guitar in tune then with the SC1 costing more than THREE ZoidsZoid Z1000 ClipOn Tuner by Sabineor FOUR IntellisIntelli IMT500 Clipon Chromatic Digital Tuner for Strings I recommend that you consider the Zoid or Intelli Awkward to use overpriced for tuning a guitar,neutral
This pedal is great help on stage Its fast and accurate and with polytune 34option34 you can easily find which string is out of tune Fast and accurate,positive
It is all preference I prefer the cactus picks These slide around in my finger to much right now To each his own Not a big fan of these,neutral
I have about quit using picks now But I needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses Thats what you get with this From very thin and flexible to 08 and hard you get a selection Pretty decent selection,positive
I like this a lot better than others that i have Easy on and off and stays put Its worth the money good deal,positive
This strap is value for money I was surprised when I got it I didnt expect something so good at this price The material is shiny blue and doesnt look cheap and the strap is generously wide The ends are leather with one side having a golden EB logo Goes well with my black Squier Strat Highly recommended Very good quality excellent product for its price,positive
They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button if not they will just pop right out I threw mine away Dont buy these,negative
When the unit first arrived I was concerned because the box had been damaged It shipped in an envelop However once I opened it I discovered an undamaged Snark tuner inside In an odd way this reassured me further as it obviously took a beating and remained undamaged When I put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly It clips to my guitar strong and stays put Its easy to read even when Im on stage and the lighting is less than appropriate for reading a display this size from arms length Im very pleased with the unit Al,positive
BOUGHT THIS SN2 SNARK TUNER AFTER I BOUGHT A UKULELE SNARK FOR MY LITTLE NIECE I WAS SO PLEASED AT THE EASE OF ITS USE I MAINLY WANTED THIS FOR MY BANJO BUT I ALSO NOW USE IT ON MY BARITONE UKULELE A GUITAR AND IF I EVER GET INTO THE SPIRIT I MIGHT JUST TRY IT ON THE OLD MANDOLIN THAT MY GREAT AUNT LEFT ME THE SNARK IS SMALL VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND SUPER EASY TO USE ITS A VERY WORTHWHILE PURCHASE BOUGHT ANOTHER SNARK,positive
Very fun to useComes with a power supplyVery easy to controlI enjoy using this to play alone It is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over itIt can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat Great Pedal,positive
Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime WarrantyI have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacementno problems whatsoeverFor the price you are paying about 1 dollar per foot you get good quality cable good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector endsNot the best but not the worst Good enough for live stage gigging and probably wont notice much difference if you are recordingI havent noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cablesThey also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where cable owner etcAffordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchaseI would recommend these cables and will buy again Good Value Price Lifetime Warranty,positive
While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated They both feel very very smooth to play and the sound is amazing I mean really amazing The Nanos sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Polys I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollowbody electric and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric its a personal preference like anything else The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat mellow sweet sound Almost the best,positive
Wow this works At first I was a little wary about using the liquidThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product Being my own bumbling teacher there was a fear I could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument However I needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs so I closed my eyes and blundered ahead thats just a figure of speech for I was careful using the stuff for the first time With care cotton and a small rag torn off my moth eaten underwear I went ahead willing to try anything I even removed the strings from the pegs only one at a time starting with the inner one first put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string Tuning then became a breeze To think I used up a great glob of practice time not fiddling but tuning Bop Coulda had a veggie drink Original Peg Drops by Ardsley,positive
The PylePro PMKS8 mic stand is good for someone looking to buy on a budget Its fairly solid heavy enough to hold itself down and is flexible enough to position the mic how you need itThere are a few issues however The metal neck is difficult to tighten onto its base without causing the microphone to be crooked This means you have to choose between having a straight forward mic and having a mic which doesnt swivel around on its base The mic holder has the same issueI would not use this mic stand for an event where its plainly visible to an audience It is simply too difficult to position it to look good on cameraI would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication Its great for a desk or a small recording studio Good Mic Stand on a Budget,neutral
Item is as described You receive 3 felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick mine was purple Picks were defect free but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks which a clean moist cloth will easily fix But because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument None the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit But over time this starts to disappear The picks are pretty comfy to hold Makes ukulele sound louder But will need to be broken in May make your instrument dusty,positive
Onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things I use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary I put them on a mic stand and it takes much less room than a full blow tripod They cant hold a heavy camera very well but a small one they will hold just fine Innovative and useful,positive
I own several of these and general buy from GLS direct but I needed some quick and had other orders from Amazon so I got them hear at same price GLS is great quality and durable I use there 100 30 and 25 cords and have never been disappointed Great product and price,positive
Ive been stringing my guitars with DAddario for several years While my jazz box is set up with heavy strings my Les Paul goes lighterhorses for courses you might say Ive been using DAddario XL strings on this guitar for a while although its the EXL140 slightly larger bottoms But why not give these lighter strings a try The quality is obviously high Tone is good as is durability If you do much complex chording youre going to miss the heavier string but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice Ill be going back to the EXL 140s since I prefer the more positive feel of the larger string But fat or skinny DAddario makes some of the best strings out there A little skinny for me but the quality is undeniable,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D1 Distortion effects pedal works great and gives me that mind blowing distortion you would only expect from a more expensive unit The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is 34 It tends to be a little noisey 34 if you turn the gain up too much You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great The unit works great for the money,positive
Havent used it yet but if its like the other cables I have from the same company it should work fine Nice Cables,positive
A very good strap I love it,positive
Reading the product description may give you an idea about this product I received plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion Its solid well made and looksfeels like it can handle the world tourGet it Its rock and roll,positive
Be careful I have a small recording studio so we put our cables through a lot and these guys just dont last They were fine for the first few months but then they started to die like a murder mystery Seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reasonFine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky I actually had two blow at one time and thought my PA was shot Thankfully it was just these cables NOT GOOD Spend a little extra on another brand These have been my favoriteGLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords Ordered three of these EVERY SINGLE ONE broke within the first year,negative
I like cool gadgets and this is no exception The red color is a metallic color and I totally dig it The display is nice and bright as well Super accurate tuning Well worth it for the price Awesome gadget,positive
I bought this stand after trying two others that didnt work well This one is very adjustable and stays put I use this in my home studio and I can place it so it comes up right under my mic boom just off to the side of microphone so when you are doing a vocal you dont have to look down or move you head away from the mic Ill be buying two more Nice stand Perfect for my needs,positive
Just assembly for a try only few rolls with music its had some hole on head thats mean bad quality buyer beware for this kind of terible cheap material product I saw,negative

The fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender Squire mini guitar the guitar falls through I will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless The fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 34 size ether Good stand but not for a mini guitar,positive
I was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once I do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on The only issue I have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune 1 red bar but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat So for me it is a quick check while I am in between songs anything with 2 bars or more will get more attention Handy but I still go to my headstock snark for most of my tuning,positive
Not bad at all this unit tunes really well same as the Boss original the only difference is that this one takes like 1 sec to respond after the pedal is activated the Boss is instantaneous other than that both units behave exactly the same Some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor for those of you who do not want to spend 100 on a tuner this one is just perfect since I am a collector I have other brands to compare Boss Korg Fender and it is the same thing it is as accurate as the Boss at least mine is and is a good mute switch also I am happy with mine Behringer TU300 tuner,positive
I was using a nylon strap before I got this one I love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap The leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and I dont have that worry of it coming loose Great replacement strap,positive
ORIGINAL POSTINGMy first Mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment The four neck bolts continually came loose no amount of tweaking could get the intonation right Note adults should probably play the MiniStrat tuned upI play mine at F Bb Eb G C For if they have large fingers they should probably use a capo with standard tuning and heavier strings so the string tension is similar to their fullsized guitars the pickup pole pieces didnt align with the strings and the finish was uneven It cost 99 and I figured I got less than what I paid for It was clearly a toy and I sold it for 25 without regretThree or four years ago I extensively played a Hello Kitty Mini owned by a friend It cost her 149 and after I tweaked the intonation and the string height a bit it was a playable instrument I figured she pretty much got what she paid for A decent little 34sized travelerRecently after reading that Fender had upped the build quality of their oriental Squier guitars I again purchased a Mini I couldnt be more pleased Right out of the box everything about the instrument was spoton The construction was rock solid the neck was straight the strings were correctly positioned the intonation was exact and the finish was flawless It was in two words masterfully made I figure I got at least 249 worth of guitar for 99 How cool is thatThe sound of the current Mini is classic Fender singlecoilshimmering with belllike overtones The pickups are functional if a bit thin sounding compared to the Seymour Duncans I have on my fullsize Strat The sixinline enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping The neck is perfectly finished and fast Because its a 34sized guitar the first and secondfret string spacing might be too tight for adult players with large fingers But for everyone else including fortunate children the current Mini is a sweet ride And at its present give away street value this has to be one of the most fantastic bargains in the musical kingdom Bravo FenderJune 2014 UPDATEThe mini has become my preferred goto electric I now have one for jazz with a single Lace Hot Gold in the middle position with a custom pick guard from Chandler Musics Pickguard Heaven see attached photo and a very versatile one with a Lace Red Silver and Blue pickup set Why For the same reason John Lennon once owned a 34sized guitar I suppose Obscure chords and finger patterns are easier on the hands because fingers have to span less distance I believe the slight tonal inaccuracy of the 34 scale is offset by increased fingerplacement accuracy Try it and I think youll like it UPDATED Awesome Build Quality for a Song,positive
That cloth They should have included something that doesnt fall apartOtherwise its great I use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned but Im with other people here who commented that you cant really tell how much of the stuff is left inside Good idea to keep more than one of these around Easy to use but,positive
This unit works as advertised Ive used it to record my garage band shows Making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice Buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds eg audience and any other background noise so if you want a more pure sound you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments microphones etc NIce Recorder Easy to Use,positive
After having played the Yamaha YPG535 88key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard in a showroom and loving it I was torn wondering what all I would be missing out on if I went with the more economically priced YPG235 I now own the 235 and it appears as if I am missing out on twelve keys That is I am not experiencing even an ounce of buyers remorse after opting for the cheaper 235 This is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than I will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality Of course my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as I will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited As such it might be best to say that for a novice one could not ask for a better instrument for the priceSo what is the difference between the 235 and the 535 Based on my previous comparative shopping I have come up with a few differences First is the obvious fact that the 535 possesses 88 keys while the 235 has 76 The 535 also includes a stand sustain pedal and power adapter which must be purchased separately for the 235 While I am unaware of the specifics the 535 also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices Beyond these definitive differences having now played both models the 535 also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assemblyWhy buy the YPG235 If price is not an issue go ahead and get he 535 it is a beautiful instrument However for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need 88 keys purchase the 235 Like the 535 the 235 possesses piano style Graded Soft Touch GST keys which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted The feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synthstyle keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability The 235 like the 535 also features USB connectivity and general MIDI compatibility as well as almost all of the same high quality voices which separate both the 535 and the 235 from many other models in their price brackets besides the pianos the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic While it is unfortunate that Yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the 235 theYamaha Survival Kit D Accessory Kit for Yamaha YPG235 YPG235 Keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor extended warranty and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply In my opinion the YPG235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck Again the 235 sounds great feels great and is hard to beat for the price Considerably better than anticipated,positive
Defiantly a space saver I can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables Its very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits My only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much Space saver,positive
After 15 years this microphone has lasted me a VERY long time and has stayed a fantastic microphone As I am getting more serious with voice over I am moving to better equipment but as a starter microphone microphone in general It deserves a nod of approval Definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it Very good,positive
i got pink cause nobody would steal it and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great pink,positive
I finally bought into the Monster Cable hype albeit with a 6 practice cable I CAN honestly tell a difference That difference being silence no abnormal hissing or popping that I got from my other cheaper cables This isnt the topoftheline Monster but still a step up from what Id been using Ill definitely upgrade my longer cables to Monster and may even see how the expensive one sounds a short one 1st of course Its a Monster,positive
I bought this new Fender F neck plate to replace the plain one I had on one of my MIM Strats but at this time I am not sure I like what I have done It appears a little thinner than the original and just doesnt look as 34original34 Fender F neckplate,neutral
Sounds just like an amp in your headphones Gain Tone and FX switch make for a broad range of sound since you wont be able to use any pedals This is a great little piece of kit if you have some fun money to spend on it 1 star off because while nothing fell out the plugs on both the bass and headphone side are very loose feeling Great sound,positive
This is now powering my entire effects board and its doing a great job It easily connects to a variety of different pedals with the adapters included and theres just enough wire to power everything without cluttering anything up with nests of extra wires The value is excellent for anyone on a budget or who is tired of full power strips cluttering up their setup Id recommend this to any musician who uses multiple effectsinstrument devices Everything I Needed in One Spot,positive
I have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviewsI already have an MXR line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp This serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run Replacing that with the EP booster did not have a significant impact on my tone Yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line boosterIf at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal I didnt find it magical though because Ive always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much differentI am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos Bought with very high expectations,neutral
The plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesnt grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag its a great idea but not well executed Not much help,negative
Excellent price Excellent tuner with one flaw Using it couldnt be simpler and it has excellent contrast I would say it was the best clipon tuner Ive had a chance to use except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal One of the little fingers that holds the ball in the socket on the back of the tuner broke off so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces This model works only by vibration unlike the red one so without the clip it is not very useful it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it but it isnt very convenient I would just superglue it together at a good angle but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments Ive seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem so I would call it a design weaknessDespite the negatives I would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective caseUpdate 4413 Added back a star Im still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer Even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results I recently purchased a replacement the SN8B but found it really disappointing So much so I may send it back I also tried a Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner which no matter how much I try I simply cannot love So I just ordered another one of these Despite the ball socket issue it is still one of the best tuners Ive ever used For the money I can afford to keep a couple on hand Good inexpensive tuner but fragile,positive
These are great strings Nice bright tone The three pack was the best deal when I ordered them Get some Great acoustic strings,positive
A simple affordable instrument cable I prefer cable ends that are formed not the type which can be unscrewed as there is less risk of breakage and noise Cable quality is not high for professional recorded youll something better but very good in general It works,positive
Not too much to say about a cable It worked out of the boxno shorts or noises The jacket on the straight plug was partly unscrewed and thats a continuing problem with these cords I use some threadlock on them I find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things Its what was desired,positive
This power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals Thats good to know but since I plan on using it to power only one pedal it works fine for me The variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects I am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands Plenty of power,positive
I cannot express how over sized this pedal is its ridiculously big and its unnecessaryif you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will doAgain please be aware of the dimensions this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though though it does rob tone It Does the Job But IT IS HUGE BE Warned OVERSIZED,positive
I personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner The reason why is the LED lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage The pitch black is nice and bold and bright One reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time So its a give and take issue This or the Pitch Black,neutral
I needed some new patch cables for my board and I liked the different color thing I believe this was part of my first order through Amazon and was totally satisfied with the process and the result Will and have used it since Thank you Patch cables,positive
Good for the price but If you can spend a few dollars more I would recommend the graph tech ones Good for the price,positive
I have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners They all work fine for me However the Snark SN2 just has the edge Its performance look and feel are great The added features are also a plus I use the Snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar Its my go to for chromatic tuner Highly recommend this Very nice and accurate,positive
Im a semipro player and this tuner is all I need A great buy worth the money The simplicity of the design and the beautiful full color screen are my favorite features of the Snark Sn1 Love it,positive
If you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano it may appear little awkward HAS TO GET USE TO THE SIZE,neutral
I couldnt say that I loved it Its only a guitar hanger It just holds a guitar If I needed another I would buy this type Guitar Hanger,positive
Ill just say newbie to ukulele no idea how to tune it instructions online say GCEA I put this on the head plucked each string tuned the machine head until it said dead on and that was it I keep this clipped to my ukulele standInstrument Stand for Violin Ukulele and Other Small Instrumentssee my reviews of it its so so the stand and just turn it on and tune the uke before I take it off the stand ONly time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts I find them a bear to buy but time will tell Anyhow I concur with the reviews on here glad I listened to them and for any brand new ukulele players out there this is the one to get C ya Newbie worked fine,positive
Nice microphone stand for the cost Sturdy adjustable good construction it works we like it Will purchase an extender to use with it GREAT,positive
This is a fine stand for the price but I was honestly surprised at how light it is I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price I do use this stand but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future It works fine just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past Very light weight keep this in mind,neutral
Have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar So it is just used as a pick holder so my picks have some places to go Can hold up to 11 picks of 50 thickness I use Tortex Guitar Pick of that thickness Great pick holder,positive
good but it not fit properly Defenley better then bone thogh I did have to sand it to try to make it fit good and I did Put it on my epiphone LP It does give a nice blues tone Beause its not bone But I had to take it off case it just did not fit right good,positive
I started using these a few years ago Picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps Work well,positive
I did a lot of research and I finally found the right capo It is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay forIt is made from a very good material and I have been using this for yearsThere are some others capo that are less expensive but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar This capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension I like this and I highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level Good Luck Great product,positive
This tablet mount allows me to use my large Toshiba Thrive in live performance situations now It makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand I never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use Impressive and functional,positive

Best strings ever Five Stars,positive
If your like me and have a big dreadnaught especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing you should really get these strings They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the DDaddarios and they are about the same price Best of all they last extremely long but Ive broken a few strings over the past months Overall great strings and pretty consistent Bright,positive
I have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin It works well for all of them and is inexpensive Great Little Tuner,positive
Worked perfectly to use my Samson mic with a stand I purchased Definitely would purchase again solid quality build Good purchase Did exactly what it was intended for,positive
When I first installed these strings I wasnt too impressed They felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than Im used to However after a month and a half of playing I really do love these strings I got used to the feel the tinny sound mellowed out a little and man do they stay in tuneCobalt strings arent as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal I find the gain to be more articulate Solos pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing in my opinion Theyre also super fast I mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do Its not necessarily a bad different its just slicker and not as coiled feeling Hard to describe but if youre used to playing nickle youll notice the differenceHonestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune I went on vacation for a week came back picked up the guitar expecting to have to tune it and every single note was dead on As they age youll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickleThese really are a good set of strings If you try them just make sure to give them time They get better with wear Pleasantly Surprised,positive
These guitar picks are just the best Simply put They are easy to grip onto even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day Highly recommended I will never use any other guitar pick other than a Dunlop Tortex I use the green 88mm picks and also the orange 60mm ones I recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks Great for beginners or the pros simple the best,positive
In the beginning I had problems However I have a Classical Guitar and I may have been hitting dual strings accidently at first After several days I felt much better about it Im pretty new to this so I take the blame Hope Im the Problem,neutral
I like the SN2 Just thought Id try the SN8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed Snark tuners have always performed well for me I play guitar and ukulele Ive used and own many tuners and brands The Snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat I usually buy several at a time and give them as gifts to my musician friends For anyone who plays acoustic guitar these things are so handy Another Great tuner from Snark,positive
Very nice quality Ive removed 1 star because of the 14 casing The sheath likes to twist off a little too easily I used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up Other than that Ive been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great Nice value,positive
I bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program Im a teacher not a student I have only used it with Garage Band but it works really well I have used it to record electronic drums bass guitar direct out from a multieffects pedal vocals and guitar with garage bands virtual amps Ive been very impressed If you really turn up the gain you will start to get a lot of noise but the noise comes well AFTER you get past the point that any reasonable signal is 34clipping34making the light turn red So with the gain at 13 or so of the way up you get good clean signal with little to no noise The cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short I bought 2 of the same Ziotek extension cableat the recommendation of Focusrite One worked the other didnt So yeah best of luck with that Focusrite should really have made a longer cable It gets in the way of the USB power plug a little bit and makes things awkward Other than that I like it a lot Works great cord is absurdly short,positive
Quality is really outstanding for the price Sound is clear and crisp I get a lot of feedback but I guess that it is not because of the microphone Excellent quality,positive
This is a very very nice guitar strap Comes with dual locking strap holes on each end Very nice for creating a great grip on your guitar so they wont fall off I originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one Very good for the price Fantastic strap best in its price range,positive
I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights They give off such a warm tone and are holding up very well Warm Sound,positive
Well i just got started playing guitar and needed a tuner This thing works well so far but i didnt have the proper 14 inch connector yet to hook my guitar straight into the tuner which i think would have made it work better So i used the builtin microphone to tune my guitar Had no problem with the first through fourth strings but it had a very hard time picking up the much lower fifth and sixth strings However i found that the other strings were very well tuned when all was said and done and i am happy with my purchase Works well for the most part,positive
as expected for a beginner Im just learning what I want and what I need This cable works fine for my needs right now works well,positive
For the price and free shipping this cant be beat Its heavy weight solid construction and very stable Pay attention to the warnings If your guitar has polypropylene finish which most do youre going to be fine If you have a very high end guitar this might not work Cant beat this,positive
Id say if you own a guitar with a rosewood fretboard this should be a mandatory purchase for your prized possession Just one bottle of this should last years and years I also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents I used this the other night to 34feed34 the rosewood on my Telecaster and this difference was night and day Excellent Product Quite A Lot For The Small Cost,positive
Exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money Fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase It has four very solid clasps one of which locks Two keys are included It also features a plush velvet interior cushioned neck brace and a strap to keep the top from flopping back which could stress the hinges and perhaps alter the factoryperfect lid to case alignment But best of all it fits my Takamine Jasmine guitar like a glove holding it secure and knock on wood keeping it safe from all harm I could not be happier Fantastic case,positive
I originally bought this pedal to boost an old amplifier signal and it works suprisingly well I wanted a boost which didnt color tone and this has worked well for my needs The price is good I bought it locally for the same price hereSince I have bought this pedal I have upgraded the speaker in the old amp and still use this to boost the speaker to use with pedals The tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great I use it with distortion and overdrive with good resultsI have found new uses for my pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting this in front of them All in all besides for a good EQ pedal this boost is effective and worth every penny Good booster pedal for small output amps,positive
They are picks for guitars and they work They also have pretty colors Right now I am just writing to get the required words out If you dont want anything heavy this is good for you They do what they do,positive
Good strings Light but Ill be going to coated strings next The coated ones are Medium which is too heavy for me Good mandolin strings,positive
Although I purchased a Lanikai LU21 ukulele some time ago I have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours Despite that Ive been highly impressed with its quality and sound As some reviewers note nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp however thats more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele The Lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range The tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well If I were going to be playing gigs Id probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument and I probably would not purchase it without trying it first but for having some fun this is a workable and recommended instrument Nice Relatively Inexpensive Instrument,positive
Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that Id had in high school This was a great compromise between portabilitystorage and sturdiness I did want collapsible legs which this has and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory and has been in constant use for months now Ive had absolutely no problems with it The height is easily adjustable and the shelf tilt is easy too Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid Love my stand,positive
Ive been learning for a little over a year and have had this capo for about that long Though my playing still isnt very strong the capo still is I dont use it hardly at all but when I do I usually end up playing around with it quite a bit My point being it gets tested more than the amount of times I use it Its simply engineered of fairly heavy duty design so I dont expect any issue at anytime soon One year into my frustration and it hasnt let me down,positive
A very attrative complete assemblage of blues harp With one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have When little boy blue blew his horn,positive
This is an excellent strapThis particular strap replaces a 2 inch wide model that Ive had for at least 10 years That is a great strap and has held up wonderfully I fully expect this strap to match my old one for durabilitySo why the new strap By not using strap locks the area around the strap button holes is much looser than a new one would be Since I recently bought a new guitar I wanted a more secure strap without going fully to strap locks So far so good Wider I wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference Boy does it ever the new 25 strap is really much more comfortable than my old 2 inch model It isnt a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb Les PaulA consideration This is suede and will fuzz for the first little while If that is an issue for you I would avoid this suede strap and probably suede in general After these strap break in though they are very soft and suppleHighly recommended for confort and durability Great strap,positive
Ive been using this for a month or so and it works as described Some people rate this above the Snark devices but I cannotIf I were to choose Id go for the Snark but this is still an acceptable tuner Nice device,positive

This PowerGrip Pedalboard Mounting Tape is VELCRO ON STEROIDS This product makes your pedals SUPER SECURE The tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping 34teeth34 would make The 34JAWS34 shark enviousWord of advice Make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board Once down you can pretty much count on an ALMOST PERMENT MOUNTINGAnd a hint Some pedals like Behringer have a rubber bottom Remove these rubber 34nonskid34 plates because they come off too easilyAlso AMAZON sells 34couplers34 These take less room and cut down on the clutterAs a matter of fact AMAZON sells EVERY THING YOU NEED to put together a Pro Board Forget the rest,positive
We purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the Ukulele They seem to make a damper sound rather than allowing the strings to make music Not sure I would buy these again But great to give the kids when I dont want to hear 6 Ukes practicing at the same time Not Sure I know how to use these,neutral
I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times Great capos You wont be disappointed Perfect capos,positive
All I wanted was a simple tuner thats what this is If you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect Pros Works fastaccurate and can recognize full chromatic scale Cons Built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped Also tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room FYI Snark makes more complex tunersWhich are actually cheaper on amazon that also have 3 or 4 extra features Does the basics,positive
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd daythese have been ordered for a couple of weeksyou seem to wait forever to save a few bucksi odered for some buddies and hear about it every dayhope they work when they do finally arrivegood luck its been a while,negative
I use it to wind my strings I recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast Very easy to use Good product,positive
For those looking for a solid well made bass amp to step up to from the cheapies that usually come with beginner bass set ups this is a hard one to beat It has 25 watts a line out for outputting to a PA system or bass cabinet and an effects loop for adding effects pedals The design is solid well made and will go the distance This is my second one the first one went two years with zero problems and I beat it up nearly every day gigging at small venues and just plain abusing itit took it well Highly recommended Great cheap bass amp,positive
Okay mine has just arrived So first of all I want to say packaging is greatI have just put it on my guitar and I have to say that I am impressed the sound is so warm and bright I have a nanoweb before and so far the EXP16 is better I will stay on with the EXP16 right nowGreat quality string Perfect,positive
Ive tried all 3 types of these and theyre pretty much asadvertised I dont really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber but it is there to a small degree To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic Well they dont sound bad but if you then switch to a normal pick youll notice the upper and uppermid harmonics that are being deemphasized by the duller attack It doesnt sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine I wouldnt want it to be my everyday acoustic tone thoughTHey fare much better with electric guitar where the difference in attack can be less notable but youll still notice the loss of some sparkle But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit theres more friction of course but its just something to get used toThe bottom line I like these and theyll probably last me almost forever but I dont really see them becoming my goto picks I like the thickness and the feel they wont slip out of your hand while playing but the loss in high end is just enough that I dont think I want to limit myself in that way except for certain situations I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers Worth a try though and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar thats just a bit too bright You know at higher volumes too its easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized and these might work better in a live setting where youve got your amp cranked up Pretty interesting,neutral
I ordered this pedal based on the previous 2 reviews but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one I wont be keeping To me it wasnt even close to as good as the Fender amp reverbs Not the best for this price,neutral
I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system Great strap protector,positive
Podcasting on a bit of a budget 200 setup I wanted good sound quality nice warm tones these mics deliver in a world where I didnt quite have the cash for condensers I wanted I needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word these sound great 3 for under 40 was fantastic I am glad I didnt break budget here Im using these with the Behringer 1202FX mixer I am so extremely happy with them LOVE,positive
I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar made in 1969 for a few months never change the strings and sounds great I put this strings and waoknow sounds wonderful few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change try this are the best Nice soud,positive
this is a great pedal I would suggest it to anyone looking to get a pedal that would do overdrive and distortion it is a little more on the gain side and has a fizzy characteristic not to fuzzy however imo Its fairly responsive too and the eq is opposite of say a tube screamers pronounced mids so rather flat eq Plenty of volume and is a clone of the fulltone OCD if you want overdrive that doesnt sound like a tube screamer than this is for you And botique quality at paupers pricetrue bypass so no tone loss props to joyo Ps crunch distortion is also an awesome pedal by joyo which does plexi tones well and is very crunchy totally great pedal man,positive
This cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for It sounded brilliant while it wasnt broken for about the 4 hours of runtime It works if it isnt abused at all but if you abuse it in any way at all your out an XLR cable I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage Not impressed,negative
Seems to work well though I dont know how long its supposed to last I have sweaty hands and when Im done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy Works great I think,positive
The item came quickly and as decribed It clamps on my acoustic just fine no string buzz or damage to the neck so far Grat Capo great price,positive
I bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but I have a completely different view The AT2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh Second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser It is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts but there are a bunch of better mics near this price Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 stay away from the studio projects C1 both exceptional microphones for the price Although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing the MXL 2003a A lot of people have claimed the studio projects C1 sounds like the Neumann u87 it doesnt the MXL 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under 500 With that being said the AT2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphoneAlthough to be fair I have a lot of experience in pro audio and production so I maybe a bit overly critical One thing is for sure though there are definitely better mics in or near this price range Its Okay,neutral
A great instrument mic using it on bass cabinet instead of a line out for that real live hitAnd the ES57 is equal to the Shure SM57 at 6000 less Good,positive
hard to review picksbut these are as advertisedhavent used enough to see if images wear wellor just disappear from usebut they are what they areenjoy what can i say,positive
Works great Easy to use Five Stars,positive
Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either This isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time You cant go wrong with Monster Cables Best Instrument Cables On The Market,positive
I bought this as a second tuner for gigs It is awesomeEasy to use easy to see Simple inexpensiveGet one You will not be disappointed This tuner rocks,positive
This is a nice product that is perfect for someone like me basically a one man band Guitar is my primary instrument and I am a decent singer but not great This can help clean up my vocals and is helpful if you occasionally stray off key a little Very simple to operate Like most swiss army knives it can do a lot of things pretty well but none of them great Hvr considering the price I think its excellent Would buy it again if stolen as they say swiss army knife for vocals,positive
Ordered this and two cables This came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit I recommend Beautiful,positive
These Fender 10 foot Guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buckEvery part of these cables are quality The best cable for the money,positive
This could be used for lightweight microphones but dont bother wasting your money if youre using a studio microphone The base has a small circumference so you cant stick the boom out very far at all almost useless There are better deals for just slightly more money Or if you really want near studio quality try the Samson studio boom mic stands Too cheap,neutral
The Snark is great I have 2 for my 4 ukuleles so I can always find oneand a 3rd for my guitar Its not just a UKE tuner LOVE THEM And gavemy grandson a shockblue one to go with his American Flag painted uke A,positive
they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great these strings are not focused on performance but endurance best string Ive ever played Great strings,positive
I didnt expect this cable to be so thin Its easily 12 the thickness of any guitar cable Ive used Not sure about longterm durability or signal lossinterference If I had the foresight Id spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable Still it works and was inexpensiveEDIT 6 months later and its dead already Wire frayed at the right angle jack You get what you pay for Cannot recommend,negative
I already owned two of these Tuners previously purchased these for friends They are great for jamming with friends are so user friendly accurate What is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze I love mine so do my friends In my opinion for the price they are hard to beat IMT500 String Tuner,positive

I have a solid non weight relief Les Paul Traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me Like these better then the bulkier Dunlops Works well,positive
I have several tuners one is an inline tuner one built into my ampetc This is my favorite go to tuner Its fast and accurate Every one in my band uses this tuner It works for guitar and bass Its easy to read and dead on Great Tuner,positive
Im loving this pop filter It looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand The built in shock mount is definitely a plus I like it because some beginners try to grab the mic in the studio when recording vocals This immediately lets them know to just speak into the microphone Also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want Amazon was great in conjunction with the seller My item arrived lightning fast Amazon is like music to my ears and thats why their products are in my studio Simply THE BOMB THE PRO POP FILTER,positive
I have three mic stands with this one being the fourth I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible1 The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down2 The bottom clamp never did secure properly It kept opening up even without a mic on it The weight of the stand itself stripped itI sent it back without hesitation Awful,negative
great tuner it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar i will buy another one of this great tuner,positive
There is no shortage of Tubescreamer clones on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues jazz and rock The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example But the Chinesemade Joyo JF01 Vintage Distortion just be the best and its half the price of a TS9About the manufacturer Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor very similar to an MXR in size and switch but cloning the circuitry of wellknown classic and modern boutique effects pedals Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products but dont just take it from me do your homework The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive and there are great vendorsdistributors within the US that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days Im definitely a fan of Joyo productsAs for the Vintage Distortion itself people have said its based on either a TS9 or the more expensive TS808 Frankly while the latter is apparently warmer and less midrange heavy than the former Im not sure theres any significant difference I played this JF01 side by side with my TS9 and its probably one of the more exact clones in the Joyo lineup For example the Joyo Ultimate Drive is an excellent highergain overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there some of which are arguably BETTER than the original With the settings matched the JF01 performed almost exactly like the TS9 in level gain and tone There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full which isnt a bad thing Its very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a TubescreamerIll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer if only because its an iconic pedal that performs well But its superior in name only if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place Id be no worse for the wear 5 stars highly recommended Nearly indistinguishable from a TS9 Tubescreamerand 40,positive
Good quality strong and excellent finish Nicely priced A foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing a must for classical players Good quality affordable and well built,positive
These strings have soothed my poor sore fingertipsThey are very light to play and make my practising easier whille Iconcentrate on building callouses Big improvement,positive
Fits nice and provides good protection Four Stars,positive
I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass This handles bass tuning much better The lit display is great for tuning on stage and because it works on vibration you dont need to worry about muting when you are tuningI also find it very accurate I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer Snark SN5 for bass violin,positive
Im very impressed really thought it would be pleather but its real leather highly recommend this strap and it came quick true Leather,positive
Its a guitar strap It holds up the guitar Using it on an acoustic dreadnought and its plenty long enough Does its job,positive
I bought one of these for a friend of mine and he said it was the best thing hed ever used to keep his picks out where he can readily get to them I bought two more today Great product,positive
I really like the idea of a 34Pick34 pocket in the strap In fact I like it so well that when I replace the strap on my other guitar Ill make sure it also has the same type of strap Great idea,positive
I tune by ear and the old fashion way but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing Great tuner Very good and solid,positive
Looks good Great quality for such a low price Fits the instrument and old Mexican acoustic and feels comfortable They arrived before the promised delivery date This was a great deal,positive
Trying out a few new types of picks and different weights I found this pick very responsive flying through the scales on my Les Paul The picks weight was perfect Its durable and easygripping Picking responsively,positive
Like many modern capos this has an unwieldy look to it that I dont like but once I get past that this is a topnotch capo that is as good as it gets for capos I play several very different stringed instruments guitar mandolin octave mandolin tenor banjo and Irish bouzouki and I like having a capo that I can use on all of them This is ideally suited for guitar but holds its own on all the other instruments I particularly like that theres nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way I can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neckI really like that fact that its adjustable and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin I also really like theMeideal MCapo10 Bronze Guitar Banjo Mandolin Capoas my all purpose capo and I own several of these because theyre inexpensive and just a great product But this is definitely my new guitar capo and will replace the Meideal in my case Great product solidly built and its a bonus that you can add the Micro tuner to the bottom of itThe construction appears to be very solid and the finish is a flat black bakedon paint or so it appears Might be some sort of powdercoating as well The top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber and the spring seems very strong with great tension As noted it will accept a DAddario micro tuner on the bottom and includes the bracket for mounting it A rocksolid product that gets the job done,positive
Nice feeling to them they get the job done and that about sums it all up cant expect to much more from them Gets the job done,positive
Sounds great Still suck at bending 3 4 A buddy of mine got one and hes killing it on the bends we both been playing for about 3 months Great harp Will buy another if it ever wears out great sound for the price,positive
White thin picks by fender what else can I say They are very good looking the only downside with thin picks is that you tend to keep buying thin picks because they keep breaking BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING FAST AND WILD WITH THEM Thin picks are good White is a good color too,positive
get strap for the price does what it is supposed to do and is comfortable too glad i purchased it just what i ordered,positive
Spectraflex makes great cables I bought this right angle 10 red cable for my older Ibanez guitar This cable is built to be extremely durable is made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warrantee The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive nor the most expensive they are a great value and I am definitely a fan I recommend this cable without reservations A Great HeavyDuty Braided Cable,positive
This is a very nice cable for the price I already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine Inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic Havent noticed any hum or crackles For sure a good buy Does What You Want,positive
Solid and super easy to use The best for the price I supposeGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Solid,positive
These are good picks and produce a great tone Theyre better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers Good picks,positive
Quality strings at a very affordable price They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product No mandolin player would be without them,positive
Used the 942s for years but thought I would give these a try Fuller sound with the 1046s butI cannot bend them like the 9s I have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety 10s for rhythm and finger style 9s for lead Get the packs of single 9s and 10s too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set Nice tone,positive
PriceVery reasonable price for what they doComfortThese stay on your head very well and are comfortable I have not noticed ear irritation yetNoise reductionThese are absolutely stellar at noise reduction These block so much sound you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums They also dont distort out side sound Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horriblySound qualityCrisp mid and high range When it comes to the low end these are lacking And if you blast your music the low end distorts But they block sound so well you dont have to blast themWhy not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffsI have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones It is very annoying doesnt work very well and looks pretty dumb too These head phones are a much better solution Great,positive
TC is very overratedMany pedals I have out performs this in my opinion The vintage BBDs MXR Vintage DElay Morley 70s echo for example just take it But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better fair not great,negative
These are high quality thick guitar picks The colors are great Unfortunately I would have expected a little better packaging I know the company is trying to save money but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive Almost didnt know what it was because of this Just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail Nice picks bad packaging,positive
My only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see A really good tuner,positive
this is what im talking about cheap but very usual form behringer very handy too but i hope then would run on batteries next time not bad from behringer,positive
Its a pick everyone has their preference but I happen to like the 114s a lot and the 34powdery34 grip on these is a real bonus It take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are 34clean34 as well Great Pick,positive
Great bang for the buck clone of a Tech 21 GT2 This pedal does not have the build quality of the GT2 but the controls are identical and it sounds darn good especially for the pocket change they charge I have not done a gutshot comparison of the two pedals so I can not comment on how close the actual circuits and components are The TM300 is more than just a distortion box Its more like a preamp I find that it does a very convincing mid scooped Twin type of clean as well as a decent Marshall type growl I find the Mesa to be the least authentic though it is not an unpleasant distortion by any means it just doesnt sound like a Mesa imho If you are looking for triple rec distortion there are probably better dirt boxes for that I actually have the same criticism of my Tech 21 TriAC really excellent pedal The TM300 works well running into an amp and because it can simulate a micd cab it can also be run directly into a PA or mixer and bypass the amp completely This thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well It can really breath new life into a mediocre practice amp or any solid state It can also be stowed in a bag easily enough so that you dont have to lug a backup amp to gigs I find it much more realistic sounding than digital modelers but it doesnt quite 100 replicate the sound and touch sensativity of a tube amp being pushed they havent invented that yet in my opinion It doesnt replace a tube amp for me personally but if you are contemplating running straight into the PA because lugging your amp is impractical this is a nobrainer Five stars for what it does at this price If you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases If you make your living doing live performances or if price is not factored into your decision making I would advise you to pony up the extra money for the Tech 21 product because their overall build quality is much higher with regards to the enclosure switch knobs jacks their customer service is topshelf and they are engineeredmanufactured right in NYC I own three Tech 21 pedals and previously owned their Trademark 60 amp and I can attest to the difference in overall build quality between their products and Behringers Soundwise they are very very similar though and I DO have much love for these inexpensive Behringer pedals I own close to a dozen of them and I have not encountered a single malfunction in more than 2 years Nice sounding and inexpensive GT2 type pedal,positive
This cable is a great cable for the priceFlexible good tone good qualityI move around alot on stage and I need cables that will keep up with me and not bind upGreat product Great cable,positive
This combo string winder peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately It fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle It is inexpensive enough that I have one in each of my gig bags and cases In some ways its like a bic pen its cheap enough that if you leave it someplace or lose it you can replace it Works well and you can lose it,positive
very pleased good stuff,positive
2 1534 speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet These hold up great year round I will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they dont fall onto my baby grand Use these with my PA system,positive
I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90 or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass but that is typical I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 oclock but when using a chain of pedals the compressor helps even out the lows and highs The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also For the price it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well Good to use with other pedals,positive
For the money I doubt you can beat these microphones I just needed something for occasional outdoor shows and didnt want to spend a ton of money So far so good I will say that the first shipment had a bad mic but Amazon replaced it for free and paid for reshipping so I am happy about that Great value,positive
You can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it youll like it This is a good stand,positive
duriong my lessons my instructor talked about several models of tuners that a guitarist can get Some are old time one still with a kick and the one he recommended was the Snark Nor the shark and that is what I thought he said when I first heard it There were several kinds of tuners and I was looking for a good quality made of sturdy materials and was in a good price range The snark I chose has been working just great for me Sharks are in the ocean and are dangerousa snark will tune sweet pitches,positive
I have many lengths of these Hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with themI am not an active musician so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage so I cannot comment on thistype of usageIn my over 40 years 10 of them on stage I have come to realize thatyou should ALWAYS have extra cables just like strings with you aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down Good cables,positive
This is more of a toy than a good pickup It functions but doesnt sound great What did I want for this price anyway Works,negative
I got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks I have on different bass The fact that it is wide is nice As others have said you need to slide the padding down but you cant beat these for the money Great for the money,positive
I found the brightness of the light to be adequate and would probably give it 4 or 5 stars but it takes three AAA batteries that according to the packaging are only good for 7 hours I did not realize this when I bought it but after replacing the batteries a few times I went to a local music store and asked for a light that you could plug in to the AC They sold me the Encore model for 35 it is brighter includes the AC adaptor and a nice carrying case After I got home I figured out that they sell an optional AC adaptor for the hammerhead for about 10 so for only 5 I could have just bought the Encore model and been better off If you are going to get one of these hammerhead lights go ahead and spring for one that includes the adaptor it will save you a lot of money in the long run Only 7 hour battery life,neutral
It didnt seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks Duralin Blue GT MediumHeavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot Ive found it mostly not useful thus far maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there Doesnt hold Planet Waves delrins well,neutral
I gave this strap lock a 4 star only because it is too large for me and is not interchangeable with all of my Schaller locks It is a great lock and works fine but is not for me Fender Strap Lock,positive
I got this because of the price As soon as I opened it the first thing I noticed was that it feels like its not too sturdy I dont know if its going to last me a while But it does its job Works fine on some guitars The neck has to be thinner though I have to be careful when I put it on as well as when I remove it Id pay for a better one if I had to get another Decent capo,positive
This is an overpriced item That is my only complaint Theres enough reviews on here that state the obvious It is small it sounds good and can keep up with a little jazz trio by itself which is amazing HOWEVER I have to say Im super uber pissed that the day after I bought this amp at sam ash for 450 it dropped to about 250 How does an amp just come down half price over night I mean what kind of scam was this company running if they can afford to stay in business and sell them half the price than they were originally marked at Its like the blue blocker sunglasses On TV Theyre sold for 80 6 months later you can get them in the barging bin for 2 at CVS This is not ethical business this is trying to get as much as you can from your customers with no regard to true value PS the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processorsEdit Just read another guy who gives it 5 stars because it can be used as a weapon to knock someone out Not sure if this amp deserves the 5 stars it is getting and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley I stand by my logically opinions of this item ZT should not have sold this for 450 in the first place It inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name A ONE OF A KIND LITTLE MACHINE,neutral
Good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands viz XL and XXL gloves and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger A bit annoying but not the slides fault I guess Good slide a bit small though,positive
Fast shipping and love this handy little tool it has everything on it that I need to completely change my strings weather I am home or out somewhere and it is small enough to carry in my guitar case OH and great price thanks Very Handy Little Gadget,positive
I used this to create a custom sound card on my macbook pro when using Traktor Scratch Pro Did not end up doing what I needed with it which was to be able to preview there is a new toy on the market for that now but it was good for adding additional channels to my limited macbook pro sound cardGood in a pinch Good in a pinch,neutral
This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly Clamp it on press the power switch and then pluck a string It will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tuneI only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 12 charge out of the box It still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery Shouldnt it have a full battery since it is brand new Not enough of a hassle to send it back but worth mentioningHad the battery not been an issue I would have rated this 5 stars Tuning your guitar made simple,neutral
Open cap rub across strings a few times Basically youre done If you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too Doesnt leave the strings oily or full of residue I will probably clean my guitar strings every time I play now Pleasantly surprised how easy and efficient it is,positive
These came on my American Tele in 2004 and Ive been buying them ever since Sweet action durable and very affordable Fender strings on a fender guitar,positive
Ive bought these DAddario strings a few times because they are a great deal They sound nice and bright and they last a good while They are easy on the fingers The best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3pack Good strings,positive
You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I dont have to have a seperate capo for eachI also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well You can never go wrong with a Kyser Not only that I like the idea that its an US company Ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job They either dont press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much This Kyser will last a long long time Kyser Is The Cadillac,positive
Dont be cheap take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars The low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that If you are doing more than just fingerpicking you might want to add pickshield My wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which I had very mixed feelings about If you play mostly standing this is the guitar for you If you sit down it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back But it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar Good structural integrity thus far My newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it I really should get a case great sound after some fine tuning,positive
I bought this pedal years ago and like most guitarists who buy new gear I fell victim to CONFIRMATION BIAS regarding the reviews I gave to my musician friends Upfront the pedal sounds great In the store if you demo this pedal youll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer but over time youll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself Turn any of the knobs past 12 and youll get some undesirable nasalhissytinny frequencies that require compression noise gating and EQ to tame The 34Top Boost34 does provide what it advertises but if the pedal itself is already Dimebagged and you engage the Top Boost it just sounds weird and unmusicalElectro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer but I think they overstepped their bounds with this one Where is this pedal now in my collection Sold for cash After deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a BOSS ME70 MultiEffects to simplify my gigging setup I figured as nice as it is to have an Analog Distortion like the Metal Muff it would never compete with the Digital Distortion onboard the ME70 boy was I wrong After getting the ME70 I did an AB test and the ME70 took home the gold easily This came at no surprise considering both BOSS and MXR are respected manufacturers when it comes to Distortion soundsWhat would I recommend you purchase That depends If youre in a metal band and youre recording an EP no pedal in my opinion comes close to fullycranked tubeamp distortion However if your amp doesnt have a good distortion channel or capability then a more conservative and affordable BOSS DS1 for a more musical metal tone The reality is most manufacturers have great distortion pedals so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone since no two distortions sound the same Personally I recommend the MXR Fullbore Metal the pedal I wish I had bought instead of the Metal Muff The Noise Gate and Mid Scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a Top Boost The Fullbore also has a Mid Frequency shaping knob which can dramatically shape the overall sound Metal Muffler,neutral
These are really great bang for the buck however like many people said they do not work well for all my pedals round ends dont fit in everythingI mean these are cables Great but not for everything,positive
I dont use these alot but when I play jazz style music or ballads they work better without playing with heavy attack and give a more mellow tone to the solos Good picks for jazz style playing,positive
I operate an alternative broadcast studio we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet We needed some standalone microphone preamps and after searching the internet I decided to give this Behringer unit a tryThis single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output Before I even tried the piece as a preamp I opened it up to look insideDO NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE THE TUBEThe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different oneFortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube There is no schematic provided so its really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unitHOW DOES IT SOUNDThe preamps sound very good full rich crisp highs deep lows its a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as I can tell For comparison I AB compared this preamp to our very expensive API 3124 preamp which is a 4channel unit that we paid over 500 per preampchannel for that is 10times the price per channel of this Behringer unit Im not going to say the Behringer beat the API but they were a dead heat in most listening tests My female partner who is not too technical but has great ears thought the Behringer was just as good as the API We also have a Grace m801 which is another over500channel preamp she definitely liked the Behringer sound better than the Grace personally I think it was the EQ on the Behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the GraceIf my API or Grace preamps go toast I will definitely have them repaired If the Behringer dies its going in the trash and Ill buy another one Its simple economics and at 100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice They sound good They have an industry standard packaging The input and output connectors are excellent It even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a linelevel signal I have not tried this because we dont need itWe broadcast between three and ten live onehour shows per week using this preamp for vocals NOBODY in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our highend pieces to this very inexpensive preamp Now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the showsRELIABILITYWe have not had any problems with this unit It is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast Ive never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it We have A LOT of Behringer gear in our studio it lives right along side gear from Neve API Allen and Heath UA Meyer Lexicon and Apogee Out of 103 pieces of Behringer equipment Ive bought weve had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box I had much worse reliability with Crown amplifiers than Behringer products and I really like Crown amps regardless of the problems they just sound so good In my experience the Behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price Thats a winwin in my book AMAZING PREAMP DEAL,positive
As soon as put it on my guitar I enjoyed the way it got the job done My first concern was Will this damage my guitar The answer is NO It is user friendly and guitar friendly The price is so low you should own at least one No problems Just music At the most competitive price available A Fine Quality Product For A Very Low Price,positive
I use this tuner to tune up my violin Other tuners Ive tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the 34E34 string vibrations thus making it hard to tune This tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings Good compact tuner,positive
Theres some element of nostalgia with the DS1 that Ive just never understood I know theyre cheap I know theyre incredibly durable as are all BOSS pedals I know everybody had one or tried one at some point and Kurt Cobain apparently used them with his FendersBut I also know that Ive almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal Its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way Ive used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals and even onamp distortion with a richer deeper toneCoincidentally I also used the BOSS OS2 OverdriveDistortion for many years which is supposedly mergesblends a DS1 with an OD1 That pedal isnt ideal either but if I turn the knob all the way to distortion its a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS1Then again it is very dependable and usually only 40 or less so I cant really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyones collection That just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time Nostalgia Durability and Affordabilitybut not elite tone,positive
does a good job polishing my strat after playing reasonably priced definitely something to keep around if you play your guitar regularly works well,positive
This is my first guitar belt it is not a good fit the connection to the guitar is far too thick I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage Other than that it is usable sort of but I am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with Too thick,negative
Tis makes it a little awkward to carry Overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show Doesnt completely hold my guitar stand,neutral
Tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years Their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception Excellent sound quality premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station You cant go wrong with these were ordering 8 more pairs Absolutely THE best under 10000 headphones you can own,positive

Im a bass player and so I dont deal with cut picks much These picks are really hard and last forever I did not notice any additional string wear or damage These would probably better suited to guitarists Really Hard,neutral
I bought this for my kids aged 6 8 they love it However it has not proven to be kidproof The microphone cable is too fragile and they quickly broke the connectors on each end forcing me to buy another cableWhen its working they love singing and it sounds fairly good no complaints about the sound quality Not kid proof,neutral
I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it Solid Secure To Use,positive
Ive been searching for the perfect capo for years now and this ones come the closest so farThe capos well made and doesnt show any manufacturing flaws at all As delivered the capo fits the neck of my Taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension Some other capos are horrible to attach and grip the neck so hard Im afraid itll dent the fretboard The Planet Waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profileI like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around Nothings worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simpleIt comes with a clip to hold a pick but its kind of hard to slip one in especially with some picks I useOverall I think this capos a winner Its easy to put on and take off Theres no buzzing and it stays out of my way when Im playing Thats all I ask for awesome capo,positive
I bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard It was already assembled right out of the box and seems well padded and sturdy My daughter likes it I like the price because of the special deal from Amazon Simple and sturdy,positive

If you are ordering these to replace one or two of your Gibson Speed knobs you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to GibsonsIn all fairness these could possibly be BETTER than Gibsons stock seem to be made with a more solid underside but the numbers are a little bit smallerThis is the only reason I gave them four starsFit perfectly on CTS potentiometers and if you replace all four of them nobody except you will know lolAll four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects as opposed to other reviewsIf you get these and they arent perfectsend them back until you get a perfect set Its freeHope this helpsnot much else to say Good but Not Identical to Gibson,positive
This mic is strong reliable and produces the sound Im looking for I used to buy all Shure productsIm switching to GLSthey are just great Just as good as a SHURE,positive
I really like this cable Maybe its not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine I keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away It probably stretches 1012 feet if you really need it too What I really like is that its compact and I dont have cables laying all over the floorOverall its a solid cable for practice Ill buy more Great cable for the price,positive
Ill keep it short I owned a Boss EQ pedal in the past and didnt have much luck with it I tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound I was looking for but the Boss just wouldnt do it for me Fast forward a few years and I purchase this little baby on a whim Man am I glad I did The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottomend than it could ever manage on its own and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced wellrounded sound Love it and wouldnt wanna part with itThe pedal itself is built like a rock I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing The individual sliders although not quite as Fordtough as the rest of the pedal haha feel nice and slide easy Each slider lights up red when engaged which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stageIf youre on the fence about an EQ or which EQ brand to buy I recommend you give this little monster a stomp Very surprised by this little gem,positive
I have owned many delay pedals in the past several decadesI like this one the bestespecially for the price rangeBoss DD7 beats the pants off the Line 6 Echo Park delay The Echo Park delay causes a little noiseinterference when not used being caused by the little LED light flashingyou can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp The Boss DD7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the toneMany great features including an onthefly samplerlooperThe ability to control it with an external pedalswitchEasy to set and adjust while playing live and ontheflyMatches perfectly with other Boss pedalsStandard Built Like A Tank Boss construction is renowned forIt also beats the other Boss Delay pedals available for quality sound and featuresMany options settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatileI bought this for quality ease of use and straightforward operation while playing liveIt also selfoscillates freaks out quite well If youre into that sort of thingMake sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual There are new operations and ways to set this pedal up to perform certain functions Best Delay Pedal For The Money Ease of Use Live,positive
not much to say if you play guitar buy one youll never be out of tune again lets you tune anytime i never even take mine off no more does this sound in tune because it will always be in tune so do your self a favor and go out and buy one very affordable you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hoursso enjoy stay tuned,positive
Very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the USB input of a computer I plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my PC Win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes I then recorded some vocals using Audacity a free open source download Recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all Recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low Note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will USB only provides 5VDC and phantom power usually requires 1848VDC Unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires Use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy Simple Super Quiet USB Mic Interface,positive
I bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin They had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedbackWell surprise surprise surprise it didnt feedback and it sounds greatI would recommend this product what a deal,positive

This is a very useful tuner since its small fast and pretty rugged Ive dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubberylike casing I have an older model that I still use also Bright display Fast tuning,positive
I am extremely pleased with this amp I purchased it because I was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill The numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price Even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get LOUD The other reviews detail the exact specs much better than I could so I will defer to them for thatHowever this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone I highly recommend it Excellent tone,positive
Ok Im surprised that this unit is now over 1500 I only spent 859 for this and Im mad at myself It was cheap enough that I rolled the dice to see if I could get away with a decent product for CHEAP It feels solid looks like a real direct boxbut sounds like ass I couldnt believe that Pyle would put that much effort into a great fit and finish product yet not put decent components inside This is the noisiest piece of crap Ive ever used I ended up buying another direct box spent over 6000 Pyle has once again lived up to its name but they should finish the name properly and rebrand as Pyle of SSorry folks but Id skip this one The 5star ratings must be from employees The only reason I didnt give it one star was because it was so cheap Remember I only spent 859 and Im the one that pulled the trigger on the purchaseLive and learn Why would I think plugging a 200000 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea My fault Noisy POS,negative
Everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very wellYou have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied afterThe string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noiseYou wont be let downDunlop makes good quality products This cleaning kit is great,positive
I bought the capo for the guys at a correctional facility that I work for It gets abused so I dont look for it to last long Would not buy it for my own guitar You get what you pay for,neutral
This the second set of strap locks that Ive owned They are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side The quick release and secure connection are great Works,positive
I bought one of these used that was just like new when I got it The craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele The build quality the Aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality You can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time I downloaded a Lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way It is pure fun to play one of these ukulelesI bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers Some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets I am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one A lot of sound out of a small container,positive
These cables are awesome They do what they are suppose to do and do it well I personally like that they are smaller in the middle and are easier to fold than regular cable If you are looking to connect your pedals and dont want to break your wallet look no farther than HOSA 6inch cable Sweet,positive
cheap easy to use cuts sound 70 Ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment Works exactly as described If you want 90 sound reduction however you will need a metal mute This one works better than the smaller rubber ones Cuts sound 70,positive
All I gotta say about this product is that I get a volumetone loss when its plugged that is a very big problem for me Other than that is very well built but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me Volume loss,negative

I own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension Several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck I picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the NS Artist There wasnt a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when I compared the capos but when I compared them from the 5th fret onthere was some slight noticeable differences Granted I had to readjust the tension on the NS Artist Why readjust The necks character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that I had just enough and not too much tension after all thats why its adjustable I readjusted the tension The tonal differences were more noticeable when I played softly and less when I cranked down All in allnot a bad capo Nice Capo,positive
Use it every week at gigs Solid no problems with the solder joints A good quality cable at a very good price Good cable,positive
Ive been using this for my beater guitar and it has done just fine in the back of my car etc It isnt bulletproof but youd have to pay a lot more for airline level protection anyway Medium padding and a decent sized zipper pocket more than I expected for the price Nice for the price,positive
It was a great item very nice strings It looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar Works great Great Item,positive
I bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio Most of the band members dont mind them Its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes Recommended Great price for a bunch of usable picks,positive
What can I say I am a string snob Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever playedI had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference The guitar has such a great ring to itAlso use these on my Taylors These will give any quitar a beautiful voiceProsLifeSoundPlayabilityQuality and DurabilityConsPrice BEST Strings EVER,positive

I decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls Wow Just wow My inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound It was just Right I cant explain it exactly The 10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower I would recommend something thicker for that though But these are great and you should get em Perfect strings 10s,positive
worked for me Got no complaints over these Very smooth and lasted me a while Love Ernie Ball strings they are the only ones I get cool,positive
This delay is really nice especially for the price I am a fan of the FAB line of effects and have several of them My favorite is this delay and the Echo They have been very durable and I am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable My only complaint is the markings on the level knobs They have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see This could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface This can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush but it should have been considered ahead of time Good Delay but knob is hard to see,positive
For the price this is one of the best pop filters It easily clamps onto my stand and doesnt move around after I place it However there is one problem Ive had with it It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter What I mean is that if I pick up the mic the arm will swivel away Granted this was caused by me dropping it once but before it was fine So for a good price you get a filter that works Good for the price,positive
Levys leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material especially on the edges It cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt Yukko The fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap Cutting edge,negative
How far wrong can you go for 183 I can give these away to beginners that dont have a capoIf you really want a capo get a Keyser or other decent capo Theyre only 20 Cheap option but not quality,neutral
Been playing for five decades now Used to tune with a tuning fork Then later used a Boss TU12 for years Now the Snark comes along and the Boss tuner reliable and true sits in the bag with other accessories I use but it has no need to come out The Snake took its placeNo need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in Fast and easy The readout is easy to see in any light Working off the vibration of the string via the guitar makes this an accurate tuner as some pickups will have too great a signal for a standard tuner and give a false reading Not with the Snark Small Handy The list goes on but I think you get the point It works well Very long battery life Easy to see Oh and did I mention ACCURATE Yeah I think I did Fast Accurate Affordable Whats not to like,positive
I put this on my Cheapo 300 drumsets snare with a Remo CS on top and my snare when from sounding like junk to sounding great for a cheap drum Sounds Great,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D2 Overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is 34 It tends to be a little noisey 34 if you turn the gain up too much You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great Great effects pedal for the money,positive
The case is very nice and sturdy It has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come The inside is very nice and soft with a big pocket to put things in it like picks tuners capos It also has a lock on the case in case one might need it This is a very good price for a case of this good of quality and I highly recommend it A Great Case,positive
I ordered one of these from MF and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didnt all work Even in perfect condition its still a subpar case But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid and from those rips its easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing As for the latches buckles there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed The other two latched but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shutDisregarding those flaws its still obvious that its not a good case The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment the handle is not comfortable to hold and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag It also wont stand evenly on end if thats important to youOn the positive side its light it does fit a Telecaster ok and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment But do yourself a favor and spend another 25 and get something better I have a Musicians Gear dreadnought case and this doesnt compare to that one at all Junky,negative
These look great on my guitar I was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didnt I would recommend these they look great The ones I got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture Cool,positive
I tried this in front in the middle and at the end of an effects chain as well as by itself plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier Whenever it is in the path as soon as I engage my effects loop the signal level drops considerably It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not The chorus effect is good but I dont want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use so I cant raise the send any more Loaded down the signal path,negative
Maybe a little bigger than Im comfortable with but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things They keep disappearing Nice big pick,positive

Let me start off by saying I have had several types of humidifiers all of which have worked well The major upside to this humidifier is you do not have to worry about overhumidifing your guitar Packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to useOne star short of a 5 star review Why The price for the replacement packetsOther than that a wonderful system Best Humidifier I have Owned,positive
In particular I favor the Dual Design Why If the need arises its possible to use a regular strap that doesnt have the button locks installed I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321 and Laguna LE200QBC guitars I have spare straps for both guitars and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discsI have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks the standard version two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990s and one from 2003 with the gold DD All three of them have held up with no issues I didnt need to retighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago Then again I dont tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as MetallicA Probably the best strap lock system ever IMHO,positive
A fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose fromA great deal for a nominal amount of money Fine assortment,positive
Well what can I say Based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a nobrainer However after only 4 months of light use used on my rig at home it is toast The cable barely holds a signal now constantly need to jiggle the thing to work And before you ask 34is it perhaps your output jack34 all of my other cables work with my geetar So it is definitely the cable Anyway I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120 To bad,negative
these are well madegood enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i ownwill purchase againenjoy happykeep em in every case,positive
I am user that likes behringer products I know is plastic but Com on Its just 25What you should know about this pedal Its like the BOSS CH1 but a plastic version a durable one by the way You get more than you paid,positive
Please dont listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldnt keep tune They dont know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch Like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient It only took me about half an hour It clearly states STARTER pack so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele especially because of the price These people just do not know how to read It has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight If you want real protection I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines it is a great buy though considering the price I highly recommend this product Great,positive
I really cant say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM Not even 3 years ago I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a 34novelty34 and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as 34gimmicks34 or 34toys34 Now as of 201314 we have so many quality modeling programs recording DAWs and AudioBus to connect them to one another Whether youre a budding professional or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers the Apogee JAM usually around 9999 deserves a serious lookPROS Extremely easy to use and widely compatible 62 No batteries required You get a small plastic converter with an 1434 input for guitar cable on one end and a digital output for 30pin connector Lightning or Mac cables all of which are included Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS GarageBand Agile AmpKit AmpliTube JamUp XT will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the boxCrystal clear digital sound 62 The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input Youll hear your guitar as its meant to be heard and with far less hissing and junk in the backgroundConsiderably less feedback 62 This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade My Positive Grid JamUp Plug wasnt disappointing me in sound quality but there was so much additional noise that went with it it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit to feed back High gain settings even something basic like a Marshall JCM900 were practically unusable Even with clean settings I had the noise filter turned WAY up and that still didnt thwart the feedback issues The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly When I first plugged it in I wasnt even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface The JAMs improvement in avoiding feedback alone made it worth its priceNo 34crosstalk34 When you do multitrack recording with a headphone jack splitter you get a bleedover effect referred to as crosstalk Basically you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track but due to poor circuitry this also gets fed back into the 34armed34 track you are recording Some people are bothered by this more than others but it makes quality multitrack recording quite challenging I havent noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever since it is a digital connection You can still monitor your playing using the iPads headphone jack separately obviouslyGain control and LED gauge 62 Not a feature unique to the JAM but I love how its implemented When you first plug in the device the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up but not being utilized by software Once the input is active in software the light becomes green However as you play and hit harder notes the light may change to yelloworange or even red If it is getting into the red your input level is too high and may overdrive the signal You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts Works wellCONS Price point is a little high 62 Admittedly I wasnt thrilled about having to spend 9999 for what I was already doing with a 20 headphone jack That being said I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best If I knew it would be as good as it is the price would have been of little concern Also there arent really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaperLightweight plastic design 62 I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM or that it is made out of plastic At the same time the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it and its a problem you can address with common senseHighly recommend the Apogee JAM Its a midlevel priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals If youre at all serious about recording guitarpick this up,positive
You cant go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick They have a better grip and a more full sound to my ears over the Tortex picks I have since went to the Jazz picks but these picks are a solid product Very Good Product,positive
Great cable for patching in and rocking out It is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well 100 Recommend to anyone looking for a good quality without an over the top price cable Great cable as always from Monster,positive
What does anyone really want to know about a string winder Yes it will help you string your instrument quicker And Yes its still in one piece I would buy it again You may even buy 2 because the same gnomes that steal picks and capos take these too It winds,positive

Love these strings Great for bending and awesome sound I dont change strings nearly often enough but with a three pack I can rest assure that I always have a back up set just in case Love these strings,positive
This tuner is tiny and works as advertised to tune my guitar bass and banjo I have tested it against other older and larger tuners and all tune to the same accuracy which is very goodI docked it one star because the screen doesnt stay on in my opinion long enough when I am trying to tune a string When I pick a string the screen flashed for a brief second with the tuning information and then goes blank It works but I find other tuners easier to use that have screens that stay on longer with each pickPerhaps a more experienced guitar play may only need that brief flash of tuning information to tune a screen but for me I find it easier to have the tuning information displayed longerAlso this tuner is tiny I can leave it on my instrument when I put the instrument in a case no problem at all The flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too Really tinyalmost hard to read tiny You need to decide if this tiny size is an advantage or disadvantage for you Exactly as advertised,positive
First of all this strap looks super cool The Hootenany style is sweeeet I have this on a cream colored stratlike guitar and it looks great The reason for only four stars is that the material is a bit thin but hey for this price I am not expecting a Levys strap All in all this is a great guitar strap Throw some strap locks on it and away you go for the price it cant be beat,positive
This is a great effect I am very happy with it Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products has always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable This delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there It is very sensitive and delivers as it should with a delay rate from 0 to 600 miliseconds Most units offer a max of around the 400 mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver I am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations Ships fast Highly recommended MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay Great pedal,positive
Has a nice smell works like a charm This bottle will probably last me 10 years Good cheap pricea recommended purchase Its lemony,positive
I bought this tuner for my mandolin I have to play a little louder than Id like for the tuner to hear me The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays Ive seen But its so small that I never have to take it off and its doing its job well Im pretty fond of this little guy Works for me,positive
This is a solid little USB Interface There are no frills and theres no latency I have used this for 4 years without any problems and its very portable I run this between my small 8 channel mixer and my laptop for recording guitar and its well worth the price to have one of these around Can also be used with tape players to import audio into your computer I use this for more than just guitar recording Solid little box,positive
I am very impressed with the quality of this strap for how little I paid Nice soft flexible leather and very adjustable I had to lengthen the slit one end to fit over the oversize strap attach fitting on my Fender acoustic electric but other than that it fit perfect Nice Comfortable Strap,positive
Ive owned a halfdozen LED music stand lights over the years This one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorryThe 9LED bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern The light is concentrated in the desired area and doesnt spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights The little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when its pointed back at the music The light is twolevel normal and BRIGHT Normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater The fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of standlight bulbs is a definite plus If you need to put a color filter over it you dont have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter The light spread is so smooth and consistent that I dont have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with twohead stand lightsThe gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well The included AC adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights The included zipper case is fairly big and bulky but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag It has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light and a small pocket for the AC adapter Its hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket but theres plenty of room for it in the case I dont know about battery life yet but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the AC adapter usually an optional purchaseThis light is a bit large compared to other LED stand lights but its so good that I dont really care Ive gotten years of service from Mighty Bright lights and I expect the same from this Even if this one doesnt last Ill keep buying more The best Ive encountered Period,positive
What can you say about a pick These picks sound good and have lasted well I have also found that felt uke picks produce a good sound on bass guitar Good uke picks,positive
The US Dream is supposed clone of the Suhr Riot and is the only one of the new model Joyo pedals that I own This is a highgain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a ProCo Rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settingsWhen I first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but I wondered if it might be a little bright I was pleasantly surprised when I rolled back the tone knob to around 10 oclock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness At least with my setup Les Paul into a Vox Valvetronix 40watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of fullsounding power chords and singing high leads Unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy DS1 or cocked wah sound Boss Power Stack I was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitarWhile Joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three I would recommend along with the outstanding Ultimate Drive and the warmsounding Vintage OverdriveHowever its worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model Joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered JF17 and lower The weight is comparable to an MXR 78 Badass Distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect Still if a pedal SOUNDS great and has yet to fail on me I refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me I think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesnt being out 55 is still better than being out 100 Another instant classic from Joyo,positive
I was waiting for a flimsy stand to arrive when I ordered something that seemed like it would be for budget price This stand actually STANDS I placed my AT2020 with a shock mount and a pop filter on and while it is heavy with proper tightening everything stayed in place And like many other people say this is a musthave if you have a home studio Exceeded expectations,positive
I just ordered three different guitar straps online One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself Then I found this and decided to get it The 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff I got this and switched over Ahhh this is a guitar strap I see why you pay more It is so soft and comfortable It looks AMAZING This is just a great product I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar Thanks Great feel Great look LOVE IT,positive
I got this as it has a little different clamp handle design than another I bought earlier Like the black and it holds well This has been appropriated by my son who really likes it on his black guitar No problem as I bought one as a spare against emergency breakage Nice Capo,positive
I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me A good Pick,positive

When I was looking for a Bass Case I just wanted something that was not too expensive and would protect my bass This fits the bill perfectly Its not really a case that is meant for heavy travel like checking it a the airport but it definitely will take good care of your bass during normal travel And the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc For the price this is an excellent case Great for the Price,positive
I have many Planet Waves cables They all work well are well constructed and are a good value I would highly recommend any Plant Waves Cables Good Cables,positive

My always on pedal This pedals amazing You really should try it yourself to understand Im using a Fender Jaguar this thing is married to it Im serious try it before you die Magic sauce to your tone,positive
I have a pretty weird pedalboard setup involving an EHX digital Memory Man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain This does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before I go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp Takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be and they get very loud at the top end but I have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around 4510 I tested to see if I could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none Does what I need it to do,positive
I first bought the Yamaha MG102c mixer but it arrived defective so I returned and bought this insteadFirst impression of ProFX8 is very good Its a lot more durableheavy than the mg102c and the knobs are constructed much betterFor example all the knobs that have centering dent on MG102c doesnt line up well some are off by a few degrees But on this ProFX8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up Knob turning pressure is also consistent and firmReally like the EQ on the Main output As well as mute on every channel Buildin FX effects are okay you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anythingWhen using USB to do recording with Audacity there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording regardless if microphone channel is turned off or notMicrophone preamp is soso I guess I have a AKG d5 and SM58 with both mics I have to turn gain and channel volume to 90 to get a decent outputBut it does the function perfectly Runs a little bit on the hot side Power cable is kinda short so you may want to look for a longer one Decent for what i use it for home karaoke setup usb have some buzz noise during recording,positive
I have tried several rosins for my violin Of all of them I especially like LOpera Jade It leaves very little rosin dust on the violin Yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for New Violin Student,positive

These are shred picks they are very accurate Pinch harmonics come easily The point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze I gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them The best picks for blues and metal,positive
Snark tuners are great Since Ive bought Snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way Ive had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything They are great and last forever This one is also super accurate and allows you to really finetune your instrument It have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played Really nice piece of equipment for a small price Great tuner,positive
I originally purchased these strings because of the 1152 gauges I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 1254 Upon installing these strings I cant really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge but maybe its too small to notice with the naked eye Im not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new The guitar that Im using them on is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice and smooth Overall Im satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings but I dont think Im ready to give up DAddarios yet Good PhosBronze Set For Acoustic,positive
I put this in a 200 guitar I have a Recording King RD06 that sounds so good that I wanted to use it for live gigs So I popped in this KK I ran it through my SWR California Blonde II acoustic amp If you have been wanting an acoustic guitar to have that 34miked34 when you plug it in this is as close as it gets I recommend getting a soundhole cover if you play with a band but you will not be disappointed The installation can be a little tricky but with a little patience and reading anybody can install it If you dont feel comfortable just go pay a local luthier to install it for 30 or ask your grandmother for help P Instant AcoustiGuitargasm,positive
Ive been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now This pedal completed that task Its hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect Very punchy and crisp You cant go wrong with Behringer pedals They are plastic though so they might not hold up under heavy road use but for home studios they are perfect Highly recommended Best pedal on my board,positive
This pedal is exactly what I have been looking for since three years ago when I started performing The distortion on this is deep has long sustain and has a nice tone to it that the classic Boss DS1 pedal does not have Its perfect for a great sound from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat bruising solosI love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since I got itHowever word of fair warning the pedal itself uses a 9V power charge rather than the typical guitar fx pedal 9V barrel jack Look at the power supply of a Boss pedal to see what I am talking about This ProCo RAT Pedal does NOT use that If you buy this pedal you will have to do one of four things1 Buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal2 Consistently use and replace batteries3 Find a converter from barrel jack to 35mm jack4 Be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourselfOther than the above excellent pedal Fantastic deep sound,positive
This is another adapter that I rarely use and now that I have a digital mixer I am not sure if I will ever get much use out of them with my rig Traveling about to use some other rig though you never know what you might run into so I plan on keeping these little artifacts for a while longer A decent adapter,neutral
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymorethere is a definate consistancey issue and a few places where the seller JJ Tubes can specify specs to make their particular tube stand out JJ seems to have a smoother sound than most Ive recently replaced the tubes in a little VOXAC4 mini and two Epiphone Valve Jrs that came with Sovtek EL84s and 12AX7s and am really impressed with the discernable difference in tone There was a real payoff in this small change the preamp tubes made the rest of the difference You dont need to spend big money for tubesthese JJs work really great JJ EL84 Tube,positive

I know when I ordered it I was buying a cheap device and didnt expect it to be great It works That should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words it okay,neutral
quiet almost hum free clear respose no volume control doesnt befront me because i use it to record to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control It tends to be bass heavy but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that I had used one in the past this is a more solid unit fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar also in two others i use here and there great job great value got herre quick in a nice little carry bag I will update if problems come later dont see why or how tho More than expected,positive
This thing works greatI play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable Accurate and quick great for between song quick tuningIts a Boss pedal so it is rugged and reliableI have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros recording artists and session musicians in and around the Dallas and North Texas area I play locally and regionally in North Texas and see this pedal on almost EVERY guitarist and bassists boards every nightGreat product well made worth every penny UPDATE After using this tuner for a month I can say that I made the right decisionFantastic product that every guitar player needs period EDIT 10232012I have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal boardThese really are the best tuners out there you should get one todayThere is no comparison to anything else out there nothing I have looked What needs to be said,positive

This Joyo JF03 Crunch Distortion pedal is just amazing My son has become a fairly decent guitar player over the past year and is moving beyond the basics so was thrilled to get his hands on this distortion pedal It was great to hear him play Iron Man through this pedal it made a huge differenceThe pedal produces a rich sound that has a nice sustain and tweaks easily with the three adjustment knobs Gain Volume and Tone This is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse At the loudest settings there is a bit of hiss but it is easy to find where it starts and dial it back a bitHighly RecommendedCFHEvaluation unit provided by manufacturer Awsome Distotion Pedal Highly Recommended,positive
Will hold any guitar that Ive seen It holds the guitar on the wall safely without having to worry about it falling Its also very easy to install Its a great price and its definitely worth the investment Not only do you not have to have your guitars on the ground but you save space putting them on the walls and not only that but it make any room look even better works wonders very durable,positive
Great little amp to mess around with The various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing The software that came with it is a little limited for true professionals but has more than you need for home use Dont be fooled by the small size this baby pumps out the noise quite well Id rarely turn my master volume above level 4 of 10 for home use and at small local taverns Id set it at around level 8 For a regular venue I have an extra Marshall 500watt speaker systemYou will need time to read the manual and learn the settings making it fun to see what kind of effects you can get No pedals needed with this thing I only gave it 4stars because I later bought the Mustang III which has a bunch more features for an extra 200 and a blowout 100watt speaker The Mustang IV is the same as the III but with 150watts Again you can but an extra 100watt speaker for 40 making the extra 200 for a Mustang IV a waste The Mustang II is the same as this one but with a 40watt speaker and 100 moreIf you need something to play with at home and want to try different effects and sounds this is a good one at a cheap price If you want the extra 20watts of the Mustang II just buy this one and an extra 20watt speaker around 30 and jury rig it Otherwise I recommend plunking the extra 200 and get the Mustang III with a digital display readout and more effects Great little guy,positive
I love the pick attack with these I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my goto choice for acoustic guitar Best picks on phosphor bronze longlife strings,positive
This is a black sponge for smaller mics I got mine for use with some Behringer mics At first I didnt think they would fit but it just took a bit of stretching They fit really snug which is excellent because they wont fall off or slide around on the mic causing noise They do what theyre supposed to do They Are What They Are,positive

I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard It does just what I wanted it to do It works,positive
The construction of this set is superb The ends have heavy duty strain reliefs and the XLR connectors are well made and perfectly mate with receptacles on the devices being patchedProbably the biggest plus is the cable itself which appears to be heavy gauge certainly thicker than my other patch sets and built to lastIn addition I love the attention to detail in the form of color coding which makes tracing cables behind the rack a lot easierI have patch cables from different brands and this set does stand out for its quality when compared to the others And the price is so close to the more generic ones that I have been using that I am switching over to this brand for my future needs Outstanding value,positive
Like my title says this gets the job done and is well built Dont waste your money spending on premium brands like monster cable and get this instead I challenge anyone to a blind test who can say they can tell a difference Why spend more money if this gets the job done,positive
MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs BUT I know several people who have had problems with the switch and I have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedalI actually use a BBE and Vox since this frustration with my 1st wah But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance I kinda think I am The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less wahed if you will It could be accentuated by me playing a Strat instead of the Les Paul CustomBoogie combination I used with the crybaby GREAT TONE but moody switch,positive
I have played the guitar for nearly 50 years now and wanted an inexpensive smallbody steelstring guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling This one fills the bill pretty well Build quality is quite good made in Indonesia not China as I had expected and the intonation is perfect The finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well A pick guard is present but when I removed the plastic shipping protector the entire guard came up with it The adhesive residue comes right off so I will play the guitar without a pickguard Bracing is light the entire guitar is light The body is a bit larger in the lower bout than I expected but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnoughtI take issue with some reviewers suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box The string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck cramping the fingers The nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more The action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully and just a little at a time This work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier but if you can do it yourself will improve the playability of the instrumentThe strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap so I replaced them with a set of DAddario EJ16 Light PhosphorBronze The improvement in tone was immediate this little guitar sounds pretty darn good All in all with some careful modification this is a good guitar for the beginner or casual player and a very acceptable one for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification himherself Pretty good 90 guitar,positive
I love these strings Im a novice and have been using the strings that came with base which were roundwound strings I dont like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes With these flats the sound is gone What more the sound of these strings is a lot more bold and has some awesome tone Its easy to tell what strings are for notes but just in case you have a hard time telling thickness for some reason they are color coded to help with that I cant speak out about other types of strings but I love these over roundwounds in both how they play and the sound I will experiment with other flats over time but I am very happy with these Wow what a difference,positive
These are my favorite brand of stringsWhen i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric since i used them on my acoustic And i have to say elixir is my favorite brand of strings They last long are easy to tune have a nice bright sound if you take proper care of them wipe them down when your done playing keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it ETC that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE i usually just buy about two sets a year im a HEAVY player i play about 27 hours EVERYDAY I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge up usually dont have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings but overall these strings are awesome are a must buy for every guitarist I LOVE these strings,positive
If you have the full folding single stand this works quite well but the ones with the rounded neck that is one piece with no hinge are a bit tight for length OK quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic I dont understand how people can spend thousands or even hundreds on a guitar and then buy an 8 dollar stand only to see their guitar fall over or get damaged at the neck If you pay attention to the prices you can really get some great deals on Amazon untouchable deals Fits well on some of the stands,neutral
This is my first fatsoflex cable I think Ive had Spectraflex cables before and theyve been fine but Ive owned lost lent etc so many over the years I cant recall The look and feel of this cable is excellent Seems very solid but its always difficult to tell with cables I like the flexibility much better than my Monster cable which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself The fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic It sounds fine no issues Im not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about highend cables being necessary Get something decent that isnt noisy and the tone comes from you and your equipment No issues in that regard with the fatsoOne last thing youve gotta love Amazon I got a 10 red and a 14 violet for 15 each while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more So I wasnt choosey about the colors I got THey look great though Oh and one thing Im a bit iffy about is Spectraflexs lifetime warranty The fine print requires a sales receipt BS IMO and says something to the affect of we will decide if we will replace it So way what you will about Monster but theyll replace anything with no receipt which is more reasonable I think But Ill worry about that when its time to worry about it but its worth considering as the return process might not be exactly hasslefree Good cable no issues,positive
I got this for my daughter a begining guitarist she has been playng for 34 months She absolutely loves it The product works perfectly and is durable The downsides are its a bit awkward to turn but easy to get used to It is very hard to accurately cut the strings GREAT PRODUCT,positive
I was amazed by the quality of construction of this item It looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windowsThe chrome on the sides looks very cool Makes it look really smartThe battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottomThe sound of this wah is pretty much exactly like Hendrix Clapton from the sixties Its a wah and wah and does just thatI tried it on both clean and distorted sounds and it sounds great on bothIm not sure if its a true bypass but I have a feeling it is Because when its switched on without the battery theres no sound coming from it Correct me if Im wrongIts different sounding from the Crybaby wah You should listen to both to know which is right for you I wanted the Tales of Brave Ulysses sound so I went with this Superb Make Classic Wah,positive
I own several of the Snark tuners but the Snark SN2 is my personal favorite It settles extremely fast and works with a wide array of instruments and couldnt be simpler Just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and in an instant there it is The display is bright and easy to read and the graph has a lot of resolution The SN2 senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup It is transposable and it offers a metronome feature The SN2 is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful 34electric red34 color My personal favorite,positive
A modeling amp will literally model existing Amps Artists and Songs from different yearsThis amp does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider JamIf you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then this isyour ampIf you need a practice amp go with the JamI have both amps and as far as I am concerned the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engineWhile the Spider 4 I have the 150 is a nice amp it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexibleI do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as I used the Jam for a longtime without and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there socalled on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation Amp only does modeling 75120150,neutral
It does the job Easy to get on and off Seems to be sturdy and well built Best of all the price Pretty good for the price,positive
this is a great product very light very sturdy and at a low price well worth the investment guitar stand,positive
Its nothing special No frills just a simple concept that works Its important to maintain humidity in your instrument especially in a dry climate like west Texas The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrumentSo when you first start using it you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist Nothing Special,neutral
sturdy strong good quality cable for guitar especially like the fit with the right angle plug would purchase again if need bd guitar cable,positive
The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals Cheap Massproduced Housed in a plastic casing But the FAB series offers affordable effects 15 to 20 at surprisingly good quality and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more If this pedal cost 50 I might gripe about how tight together the inputoutput9V jacks are I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix Speed and Depth controls on the top of the unit or the small footswitch But at this price for it to sound THIS good I cant complain at allDont expect the FAB series to be good at everything But if theres and effect out there that you only use once in awhile especially anything involving modulation or delay the FAB series is going to do it well and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals Its just a great option to have for casualbudget guitarists I know what youre thinking but,positive
I bought a bunch of these when I started building my pedal boardTheyre very inexpensive but seemingly quite high qualityTons of bang for your buckSeemingly no tone loss no added noise and no colorationThe right angle ends are a little big and bulky they may not do so well on a tight and jam packed boardBut for average boards they work greatI gig and record with these Great productOnly negative check bc the ends are too bulky Bang for your buck,positive
i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome exactly what i was looking for and for the price i can not get a better dealtotally satisfied great,positive
Even though these are folk strings I put them on my 35 year old dread and they sound really goodI hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicateI also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishingSo far so good Sound good on a Dread too,positive
The lil suckers are all about tuning stability Those other style string guides just arent the same because the string binds too much Gave them 4 stars because I don t like the little nibs in the underside I filed them off Gotta have em,positive
I hesitate to write this review simply because its pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings To be honest I was very very impressed with their feel and handling I do think theyre the best playing strings Ive used when it comes to pure playability Hands down none better They were buttersmooth and great for flat picking But for me it was a tradeoff because I simply wasnt impressed with the tone I even took the time to try them on three different guitars all dreadnoughts a classic maple sidesspruce top a mahogany backsides with spruce top and a maple backssides with a nato top On all three I didnt like the tone as much as the strings I was using I really wanted to like them but they simply didnt have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally useThis isnt to say theyre not great strings that sound different on other peoples guitars but I simply didnt like them on mine I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use and the treble sounds tinny vs the clear ring of the Martins I normally use To be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how youre going to use them I play in acoustic groups and the Elixir strings just dont have what I need to be heard in spite of how great they feel under your fingers If playability is more important than great tonal range then by all means buy these stringsyou wont be disappointed Im guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones Great feel and handling but not the sound I like,neutral
I decided to try these mainly due to the fact that I live near the ocean and thought thermocouple up better I restrung an electric acoustic with these and it sounds great with or without the amp I will definitely recommend these great strings,positive
I usually use Dunlop big stubby 20 picks I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today and I just had to order two more because theyre so amazing The attack is second to none At first the pick felt a bit strange as Im accustomed to the thicker Dunlop and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava but in no way has my playing been hindered if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly and by far these are the most comfortable picks Ive ever used What a findUPDATE 6614Still the best pick Ive ever played If youre worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings dont worry they wont at least not from what Ive seen Also pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks Wow,positive
Im not a big fan of Planet Waves because they ruined the Dare Strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder Shoulder saver,positive

I cant remember how many years ago I started using this great stuff Like everything else moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time I play Almost as good as draft beer,positive
The digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal Do I use it yes However I would likely trade it for an MXR or DUNLOP if I had the opportunity It doesnt sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it It also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase While some may like this I want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain ok,neutral
I heard alot about these stands and finally decided to buy one after my cheapo one fell over with my bass still on itThis is a nice looking well designed stand and feels like it can withstand the rigors of constant use However the 5th time I took this to a show I expanded it and one of the screws and nuts attaching the back leg to the support bar fell off and I never did fine the missing screwwound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night I ended up buying some screws and fixing it which was also a pain as the nut needs to be inserted about 6 inches down the pipe and secured so you can thread the screw into itnot an easy task I really expected better quality for 3500 after such light usestill love it but not to a 5 star level Fantasic stand but,neutral

Ive been eyeing these stands for a while 4050 always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright Id spent a little money usually 510 here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base Now that I finally have one of these Im throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these Hercules standsIt hold acoustic and electric guitars very well With the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar The angle this leans back makes it very stable and when a guitar is hanging on it the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over It holds both electric and acoustics I havent done any full drop tests but regardless of which guitar I put on it the stand didnt once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitarPiece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars and this stand lives up to expectations and does exactly what its meant to do Durable and Sturdy,positive
Currently using this with the Blue Yeti microphone and the Blue Radius Shock Mount When fully extended the arm cant hold the entire weight of the shockmountYeti microphone I rigged it behind my monitor wall mount frame didnt want to mount the montiors to the walls and it works just fineNot as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine Simple but works wonders,positive
Nice little amp stand I wish it looked a little classier but i guess its probably for people that like gigging or a music room Helped a lot with vibrations in my apartment building Nice,positive
Many years ago I had a Fender Stratocaster and I had to get rid of it so now I have the closest that I will ever get to that guitar again This one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well This guitar rocks,positive
We went to the local GC to try out different guitars mostly blind to the price just looking to see what we liked best After a couple of hours we found ourselves repeatedly coming back to the Cordoba C5 It has a nice resonant sound good playability and very attractive finish The room we were in at GC had classical guitars up to 1200 and we really didnt find a guitar we liked better We had a 50 coupon so we bought it from GC but afterwards took it to our local music shop to have their tech look it over for us He was also very impressed especially with the fact that unlike most classicals this one has a truss rod adjustment It required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup Excellent guitar especially for the price,positive
These DAddario EXL110 strings are light responsive and make my Gibson guitar sound great They work great Why use anything else light great response and tone,positive
The plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of VERY thin plastic and cracked in two within a week of light use I guess I can redo it with electrical tape to make it work but I have many Whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15 years I expected more from this manufacturer but I guess the quality is not the same as it used to be ordered two of these one was broken within a week of light use,negative
Was looking for something slightly improved over the Snark but still easier to use and lower cost than a strobe tunerWorks well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitchAppears the tuner is a AW2 and the G guitar function is in that the clip fits a guitar headstockWorks as anticipated Easy to get that last bit of fine tuning Quick and accurate,positive
Felt kind of too stiff and rigid to put on a guitar at first but the more you use it the more it will wear in pretty redundant sounding I know The color advertised was not the one I received Wrong color but its pretty nice for a cheap capo,positive
I love dunlop straps because Im a tall guy and theyre long enough for me not to look like an electricguitarplayingmariachi Long enough,positive
I had a friend with one of these and he loves it I got one on his recommendation and when I put the batteries in it it started smoking It did work for awhile I pulled the batteries out and tried to AC adapter and it smoked again this time it did not work I am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work holds a grudge I would not advise anybody to get this Oh god,negative
I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that When playing hammerons and pulloffs sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking but not when using this pedal It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound Works great if used correctly Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that loudersofter soundI use this with a Gibson Les Paul and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion Great compression pedal,positive
Its great for cutting strings but the winder is pretty difficult if you dont know what your doing Warning for beginners dont get this ehhh,neutral
Havent used it with the singer in my band but hooked it up to my amp for a short test It doesnt appear to be DOA and as some of the other reviewers say it doesnt appear that I have to be within centimeters for it to pick up I looked at all the wires inside and they look OK Nothing out of the ordinaryId say if you were Carlos Santana you might want a better mic but for those of us in garage bands and local bars for the price come on How do you beat it Seems to be fine,positive

Im a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars I learned a long time ago that guitarlike instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung This is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but I also thought the instrument would double as wall artSo when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electricacoustic uke from Hawaii I immediately went shopping for a wall hanger There are more expensive ones out there but this wooden String Swing turned out to be perfect Easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall Call me a satisfied customerJM Tepper Perfect inexpensive wall hanger for a ukulele,positive

This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger Im borderline skinny and it still wont fit Save your money unless your under 10 years old Too small for my finger,negative
i mean sure they get the job done but therere 2 things im not too convinced about first stability you have to be very very careful as how you distribute the microphones weight and be pretty careful not to rotate it even a litlle bit otherwise youll find yourself with a shure sm58 with a dent like myself and second i havent had actually any bad experience with this but dont seem to be that strongly built for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules good stands not great,neutral

This pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter It is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile Works great,positive

I used this to tune a coconut thumb piano If it can tune that it should handle your guitar or bass FINE Was really impressed to see it in action NOT THE SMOOTHEST operation in the world but its gigbag small and accurate More than guitars and bass,positive

What was thought to be a DOA model ended up being a mistake on my behalf My iPhone 4S which I have had for about a year now mustve had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fineunless trying to use the JAMIn The Box Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three stepsIt comes with the JAM and two cables USB and IOS It is bigger than I had imaginedIts almost the length of an iPhone Feels nice and is very light The cords arent very long My iPhone 4S was not compatible ended up returning it,negative
I read all of the reviews and bought 6 pairs of these based on the reviewsSo I put these on my Gibson Les Paul last night and played for a few hours I didnt hammer the strings just played easy mostly the EaglesAs I was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward I took a quick look at the strings I was shocked to see the high E and B strings were already flattened I never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playingThe strings sounded great but by the time I had them stretched enough that they would hold tune they were already wornI guess Im going to HAVE to go to heavier strings so Im not changing strings every few days These just did not perform as expectedGiving these 3 stars is being generous I have 5 sets to use up now damn I was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up but they lasted for only two hoursmy Fender 3250L bullets at least lasted a few weeks Going to try the Fender on my Gibson and see how they sound Im still in search of the perfect set of strings Im open to suggestions Put these on and played last night,neutral
perfect size for us big guys i do recommend some snap locks for it though great for us big guys,positive
Im sure this isnt the best echo pedal or even in the top 100 but it serves its purpose fairly well Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isnt something that most of us cant live with for 1499 us its worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate The pedal gave up the ghost died In a relatively short amount of time I replaced it with mini modtone type delay I actually like the dano sound better but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better echo pedal,neutral

I have had one for two years and no complaints needed another for my travel guitar The lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension Finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple I take particular caution to make sure that I dont leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently Works well,positive
I purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim I was looking at some nicer ones and decided to give it a go for only 20 It came in the mail today and i was surprised that basicness of the packaging Very little instructions at all actuallyThis DOES NOT ship with a 9 volt battery and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew 4 corner screws on the back to do so wish there was a plastic back or thumb screw optionThis pedal is really quiet and not in a good wayDont expect to boost your signal level with it with the makeup gainoutput knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down it was about the same volume as the original signal only a little noisierDid not seem to be a tone sucker in the chainadd any noise when off Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on due to the nature of raising the noise floorIt also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boostlow cut going on even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end It is quite bright soundingWith that being said it works wonders on single stringdouble stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the G B and E strings and makes them sound tight and fullIt does seem quite durable The case isnt made of cheap plastic which is a good thingThough not as rugged as some of the other pedals I would ownThe switch and inputs seem a little cheap though granted it was a 20 pedalI feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea however for homenon dailyuse i could see it lasting a whileThe LED is really bright Almost so bright that when youre looking to adjust the controls it makes it somewhat hard to see what youre doingAll in all if youre looking for a cheap compressor to boost your treble strings and give em some extra punch this may be the pedal for you especially if you only have 20If youre looking for a warm full bodied compressor this is not the choice for you You should really wait and get the MXR Dyna Comp for just a few bucks more Not as bad as I was expecting,neutral
This product has a simple function but if you need a 9V adapter this is the one to get I trust the Planet Waves brand Does the trick,positive
This does some fairly cool things to the sound but there is a lot more out there This would be great for a new person experimenting with effects Okay for the,neutral
I just put this on my Dot Hollowbody Its a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job I like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it The price was great had the Gibson name on it and was a great value 5 stars WOW great strap,positive

I almost always use Ernie Ball strings on my electric guitars Ive been using them for 30 years and never have been let down by the quality and sound Sweet,positive
Not much to say about a chrome neckplate its largely a cosmetic item But my old one with the serial number was corroding pretty bad and I liked the look of the new one A few people have mentioned that its thinner but assuming you also have the pad underneath which you should that was not a problem for me at all Anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws Installation took all of 5 minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before Looks great Easy to install looks great,positive
Does the trick I use it all the time and havent had any issues with functionality or build quality Id recommend it over more expensive capos any day Good purchase Good Capo for the Low Price,positive
Ive been playing for over 40 years I currently own 60 or so guitars My problem with LPs is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck Ive bought and sold quite a few Another problem with real LPs you only get one chance to drop one just see how many used ones have headstock repairs They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play I deal in used guitars picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap I didnt mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars even a lot of higher end guitars need it I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done Chinese version from 2011 and only needed a slight leveling would have played fine without it but I am very picky It didnt take much to get it set up small truss rod adjustment new set of 10s for strings little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bitnote it played well the way I got it just like my stuff perfect Got it setup and plugged it in to check the electronics and thats when I started to really become impressed with this guitar Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character these sounded pretty good actually very good nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks It cut through really well I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didnt lose any highs when turned down The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice I popped off the back cover to check what was in there full sized pots maybe not the best quality but much better than expected I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix whats not broken Yup I said on my personal guitars because I am keeping this one for myself The neck is very fast and comfy its NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine once again if it aint broke dont fix it Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut Ive setup hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work doesnt matter what price point you are at This also has a bolt on neck A lot of players say you have to have a set glued neck I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound IMO I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking My advice is to go try one my taste may not be the same as yours There are a lot of good value well made guitars nowadays I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special Get one get it set up for a few bucks if you cant do it yourself and you will have a good instrument Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar Good Value LP,positive
The fact of the price for this and the 18 cent shipping is pretty damn good Because I have 2 Silverstone SS11s and a stratocaster and I took parts of of one ss11 to fix the other then I bought these strings for it Fixed it up And now that guitar sounds better and less Buzzy than the strat Also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase I lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow Anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and REALLY cheap shipping I will buy more later to fix my other guitar when I get the bridge nuts replaced Great tone,positive

This switch goes with the Fender Blues Jr III series of tube amps The connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it These are single channel amps the foot switch activates the Fat Switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups For an LP or other double coil the switch is almost overkill But this is the switch for that amp This is the switch,positive
I recently acquired a Vox Valvetronix AD100vt combo amp from my local Music shop I use this amp mainly in the Modern UK preamp setting for most of the music I play When I tried it at the shop it sounded great Of course I couldnt go stage level in the shop so I couldnt really get a feel for the soundI took it to practice the next day and was really put off by the floppy sound of the low end when chugging on the low E So I went about experimenting First I converted the combo amp to a closed back speaker cabinet instead of the original Vox openback design Small improvement but not close enoughAfter couple of weeks I also noticed some volume variations as I played With a little research I found that it is one of the signs of a bad tube I did a little more research on the 12AX7 tubes and found that they are not all created equal of course and was looking for one with tighter low end This one came up in the specs of doing just that I believe it was x where I got that infoI got the tube this morning put some gloves on an went about switching out the tube YES TREAT THESE LIKE HALOGEN BULBS THE OIL FROM YOUR SKIN WILL CREATE HOTSPOTS AND DAMAGE THE TUBE QUICKLY I pulled out a GT Groove tube from the amp I was totally surprised Groove Tubes were THE tubes to have in the late 80s Now a days I read they are rebranded Chinese tubes So sadAnyway total tone improvement Got the bottom end I wanted and I had to make some significant eq adjustments from my original settings and easily nailed the tone I was so looking forward to Tighter Bottom End in my Vox,positive
Great tool I used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys but this trims steel and nylon with ease The quick slack takeup winder is nice also but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars Nice tool,positive
I was very anxious to get this pedal in the mail and try it out so that I could write a review of my own The reviews on all Joyo products are extremely polarizing Some people love them and think theyre every bit as good as boutique pedals costing three times as much while other people including a significant portion of the hardcore techie community despise the whole concept and wish they didnt exist Having tried out this specific product the Joyo JF15 California I can tell you that Im extremely impressed for only having spent 40 to 50First a word about Joyo Joyo is a Chinese company which for a lot of people loyal to American products starts them off on the wrong foot Further adding to the controversy is the fact that many Joyo pedals appear to have virtually copied the circuitry of wellknown Western boutique pedals such as the Fulltone OCD Joyo Ultimate Drive Ibanez Tubescreamer Joyo Vintage Overdrive and MI Audio Crunchbox Joyo Crunch Distortion If you find that disturbing or appalling I wont try to change your mind but consider the following Joyo has found a way to manufacture surprisingly faithful clones of these very successful pedals at a price that even entrylevel casual players can afford Larger companies such as BOSS DigiTech and Ibanez openly copy ideas clone sounds or borrow inspiration from other successful pedals Finally if you want to pay more the boutique pedal nobody is stopping you from doing that There are certainly areas where Joyo cuts costs by using cheaper materials and the Joyo is absolutely not a oneforone clone My personal opinion is that if Joyo has found a way to take the concepts of these pedals and make them cheaperpower to them But again reasonable minds can differ My primary concern is How does the pedal SOUNDThe answer to that question is surprisingly good The specific pedal cloned by the Joyo California from what Im told is the Tech 21 NYC Character series which was a pedal series apparently now discontinued that modeled popular amps such as Marshall Fender VOX and Mesa Boogie Like the Tech 21 pedal there are 6 onboard knobs including one called Voice which essentially a transparency control the more you turn it up the less is sounds like your original amp and the more it sounds like a Mesa Boogie There is also a 3band EQ Low Mid High which seems to do a pretty good job crafting your tone Finally there are Level and Gain knobs that work as if they were the corresponding knobs on your amp Fortunately I find with the level gain at 12 o clock the volume is basically on par with your original signalTrying to describe the tone in writing is difficult and is obviously going to vary a great deal depending on your guitar amp and other cables and effects I run a Gibson Les Paul through a small VOX Valvetronix combo and the resulting tone was good Most importantly it sounded very different than the normal tones I would get through that amp Admittedly I do not have much experience with using an actual Mesa Boogie amplifier but I think people get a little too wrapped up in making that direct comparison anyway Obviously if want the true sound of a Mesa Boogie half stack youre going to have to go buy the real equipment But the tone that I found with this pedal was very fullbodied yet still retaining clarity on the high strings The Drive knob works better at the lower and midlevel gains it is capable of higher gains though I did find the pedal to become somewhat noisy with the Drive knob past 3 o clockThere are two ways to think of this pedal First you could use it as an always on amp modeler if you really like the tone it produces In that case you could turn the Voice up and keep the Drive low while adding other distortion pedals effects to that base sound Second you could think of it strictly as a distortionoverdrive pedal and turn it on only for parts of songs where you want that effect However one very nice and very amplike feature of the overdriven tone provided by this pedal is that the tone cleans up very nicely when you turn the volume down on your guitarOn a final note the build quality on the Joyo California out of the box looks to be fantastic The switch is a click metal button similar to those used on MXR pedals There is a back cover for a 9V battery or there is a wellplaced DC 9V adapter jack which works with standard 9V adapters such as BOSS and OneSpot Sorry for the length of the review but I wanted to provide some good information based on my experiences since I struggled to find honest reviews while I was doing research I cant promise everyone will like it but considering the poor quality of the 40 pedals I used to buy from DOD Danelectro and Ibanez SoundTank growing up its pretty hard to regret giving the Joyo California a serious look at that same price Enjoy Outstanding value and versatility for thick Mesa Boogielike sounds,positive
What a great multipurpose guitar tool It works great I really like the fact that it is cutter a winder and a pin remover all in one The quality is really nice Next time I place an order Im going to get another one as a spare Id be lost without this tool fantastic tool,positive
These strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers My acoustic guitars seem to like them too all except my 12string I have not switched form Martin strings on that guitar smooth,positive
This is actually quite good no problems after 2 seasons of work and the neutrik knockoff connectors plug into devices well The funny thing is they dont connect that easily to each other like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run but a little finagling will get them to mate Im not one to cheap out on a lot of things but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays Im not saying there isnt a place for high quality cables but If you have jobs were you dont need cables made of pure spun 100 angels pubic hair these will get the job done Good enough,positive
great microphone at a very good rice super mic,positive

If you are like me my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam I recently purchased and then returned the iRiffport I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement Here are the reasons why1 The connector on the iRiffport the one that goes into the iPad is not a strong connection at all it feels as though it could disconnect at any time I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way With the Apogee Jam the connector is just like the iPads connector except it ALSO has the prongs that come out of it securing the connector into the iPad To remove the connector from the iPad you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the prongs go in so it can be removedvery very secure I use the Gumdrop case on my iPad which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used IMPORTANT if you have such an iPad case like me I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport In fact the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large that I felt that it did not fit well through my case On the other hand the Jams connector is the same small size as the iPads original connector This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad2 Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport you can hear sound directly from the iPad With the iRiffport you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward Nonetheless with the Jam I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers With the Jam I have this3 The Jam has a gain meter ie an LED and a gain control The iRiffport does not When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad but not to any software blue light or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application green light There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport4 I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam If the cord breaks I simply replace the cord not my iPad connection device The iRiffport uses its own cord and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my normal guitar cable I used with the Jam5 Although a fairly minor point it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple look at their website and their Garageband video And since I have Garageband on my iPad I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with GaragebandSo far Im very pleased with the Jam Apogee Jam vs iRiffport,positive
This is a genuine Fender Switchcraft brand input jack It is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but thats an easy adaption if using a copy strat It works perfectly Great price from the seller as well If you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets As described,positive
If you need it good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap Leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes Price was right Delivery was immediate Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument since it comes in at least two distinct color tonesPlanet Waves Mandolin Strap Brown Also comes in Black There is also an embossed model Brown offered at minimumly higher price Mandolin Support Strap,positive
So good that I bought another one Love the heavy cord and gold connectors Bass sounds great I just learned last night how to coil them up I guess I should read instructions more carefully But no harm done still works great The Best Cable,positive
If you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about DigiTech effects pedals theyll tell you to stay away from themexcept for this one Thats because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the 100 TS9 TubescreamerIn fact the TS9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone Notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock But since the pedal works well as a levelgain boost Ive heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects to really push them to new levelsBut the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the twoband EQ Virtually any distortion pedal has a Tone control that will make the tone darker or brighter But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble or vice versa you may not find the sound you want Thats whats so great about the Bad Monkey if you feel like your tone is too weak you can fatten it up If its too muddy you can add treble And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you likeConstruction is extremely durable die cast metal and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal but I find that easier to useIf youre a beginning player or a player on a budget this would be an outstanding pedal to own along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal Theres really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear But even for player where money is not an object dont overlook the Bad Monkey It might just be the only tube overdrive pedal youll need Outstanding value for versatile tone,positive
As far as amps that model vintage tones This is the bestFor my ear Line 6 Vox Crate Digitech etc are nowhere near the Fender Mustang if you are comparing Vintage tonesI have played amps and effects from many companies as well as many of the hybrid amps that combine tube and digital tones and if you are looking for the best recreation of Vintage Blues Rock Hard Rock Country tones the type of tones that you get from some of the famed Fender amps the Mustang Series is as good as you are going to doI originally bought the Mustang I for my 9 year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him I could hardly let him playThe tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp It is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs When you add the Fender FUSE to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value not to even mention the Ableton recording software that comes for free with the ampThe reason I love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great Fender amps like the Bassman Deluxe Reverb and Twin Reverb I have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this wellI have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvyFor the Tube amp snobsNothing is going to match the sound of a really great Fender Tube amp But if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the Mustang will be a great practice amp for you OR if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your Fender Tube amps weighs the mustang is a great choice I am selling my only tube amp now that I have the Mustang II because I dont gig and really need an amp that I can practice with at night while the kids are in bedFor the NonComputer folkThere is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer And if you want to give it a try it couldnt be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tonesFor the MetalheadsThis amp probably is not for you Go try and buy a higher gain Line 6 or the Vox ADT series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones There are some decent metal tones to download on the FUSE but the real strength of this amp is Vintage tonesLet me make it clear I played my sons Squier Mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing I have a Fender Strat Squier Tele and a Les Paul and they all sound amazing in this ampThis is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely NO buyers remorse Unbeatable value A great toy A perfect practice tool You cant beat it Best Modeling Amp for Vintage Tones,positive
I found that these were OK but the heads were bigger than I could stand to use on my cramped for space pedal board So they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables Good enough patch cables,neutral

In 40 years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality Ive never broken or worn out the capo I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars The spring tension remains strong after several years which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing The only problem I have with them they seem to disappear when Im not looking I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily My 5th one,positive
I was concerned when I bought this that my microphone stand would be prone to tipping over since there isnt a counterweight However not only does this thing lock in tight and not slowly tip down like other boom stands Ive used in the past but it hasnt tipped over yet after quite a bit of use My concerns were unfounded,positive

Ive been a Jazz III fan since 1997 starting with the red too buttery and rounded sounding and then moving to the black durable but a bit tubby sounding Eventually I tried a 10mm Tortex of this pick which had good attack but was somewhat mushy sounding through amp simsBut then I tried this 60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups More mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack and less lows Now youd think this would make your guitar sound thin and indeed it sounds thinner but also clearer by a factor of twoThus when recording through amp sims you get a clearer more dynamic more attackish sound When using the 10mm the fundamental was a bit too strong which made for a mushy amp sim sound but this 60mm did the trick It just sounds heavier tighter and more articulate While it does wear faster for recording purposes its my current ultimate pick of choiceSo if your guitar doesnt sound clear articulate or aggressive enough first give this pack of picks a shot But you dont have to take my word for it danehhnan Improves DI guitar recording tone,positive
Im normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever It was used and the strings were dismal sounding so I bought these DAddario EXLs They hold pitch beautifully My only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings Having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric dont like my heavyhanded approach to pressing down the strings As a result the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until I relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch It will take some getting used to or else Ill simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing All of that said the strings are pure joy to play What can I say Excellent strings,positive
These headphones are amazing They are absolutely fantastic for the priceThe only problem I face is that they hurt my head from the pressure of wearing them But I just need to stretch them out Amazing,positive

I wasnt sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since I was just starting out I bought this to work with Rocksmith 2014 and it did the job just fine The guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible It turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbageI put new strings on it and fixed the intonation adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar and it sounded a lot better Unfortunately theres no 22nd fret on this guitar That probably shouldnt come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have 21 frets but theres this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the 22nd fretThe single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesnt pick up much of that hum or else you resort to using the 2nd and 4th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the humI think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too I havent gotten that far yet Ive had it since February changed strings on it twice in 4 months and so far its proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn onexcept for that 22nd fret oh well A decent starter guitar,positive
I was a little disappointed Dont know if its a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots 1 was out of spec 315k and 2 were almost out 289k 205k 1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10 They are CTLs so Im a bit confused Other than that they work fine they have the nut washer and cap included no knob I will be upgrading the caps I was a little disappointed,negative
Great precise tuning with the SN2 versus the other Snark versions I would only go with the SN2 Butlike all the Snarks they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint Treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart Great tuning but very delicate,positive
I bought this tuner over the TC Electronic poly tune and I am very happy with my purchase Very simple to use great visibility and it does not color the signal when not engaged It also has the ability to daisy chain from it into other pedals but currently I have no such need I highly recommend Nice and simple,positive
Got this stand to mount a Studio Projects C1 condenser mic The stand is very stable and works well It is very reasonably priced as well VERY STABLE STAND,positive
This is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right I like to ride my bike and take my uke along The small size means it fits my panniers just fine The thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes The larger foamnylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they dont fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well Highly recommended for the adventurous uke player love this minimalist case for my soprano,positive
It does the job The only problem is that it sticks out a little to far down underneath the guitar neck thus impeding the fingers from taking the right position for some of the chords You slide it up and away you might loose pressure on strings and your guitar will make funny noises especially if you use hard strings For the money it does the job ok Its a good one for beginers like myself For the money you cant buy anything better,neutral

For the most part this is a well builtdurable gig bag I only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding If you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you If you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case Remember you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that Good bag for a non expensive guitar,neutral

review updated after more time spent with the micWell theres definitely some detail missing in the mids but it has a generally pleasing very fat aka muddy tone Makes a fair snare drum mic Needs a bit of EQ for almost any practical application I dont think Id use it to track the vocals on anything but it works Youd be better off with a similarlypriced smalldiaphragm condenser and a windscreen Cheap and really not all that bad,positive
This is great idea to clean guitar strings Ive always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the topSimple to use small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensiveUsing this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time Great idea,positive
Works with any strap For a quick detach system of so you dont have to drill for a strap button to hold your guitar Great product,positive
I see mixed reviews here At this price no telling what the quality control is like but as I wrote in another review on this type of item you can buy 3 of these and if one fails youre still ahead of the game Theyre so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store well worth taking a chance Mine seems to be fine doesnt look or feel flimsy at all I cant see any difference between this and what I buy in a retail package Works for me,positive
I have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there Ive used ernie ball fender prs just all kinds When I bought my first real fender guitar it came with fender strings and I loved them So when I needed more strings I just got fenders I am happy to say that I will prolly never buy different kind of strings again They are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them GREAT strings Fantastic,positive
I recently picked up a used Casio Privia PX320 and it had a cheesy little square sustain pedal that slipped around and had a terrible feel I heard that Casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway It worked I needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to openIt also worked perfectly on my Roland RD300NX but I expected that What I love about this pedal is it has a fantastic feel that rivals a real piano and is the equal to the feel of my expensiveRoland RPU3One main reason why I gave this five stars in addition to the compatibility is its built to last Its heavy all metal exterior except for the bottom pad and has a six foot cable that allows you to place it practically anywhere Plus the price is right In fact the entire package is impressive when I compared it to other models that I considered And its light years ahead of the OEM pedals that Casio ships with their Privia keyboards Beautiful feel and works with my Casio PX320 and Roland RD300NX,positive
I love this cable They last for ever and NEVER cause buzz or noise These are the only ones I buy now Love this product,positive

This Dunlop Ergo Pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar This is a great way to always have picks handy especially if you drop one while playing Here are my observations Small Size is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar Easy to Attach just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed Good Capacity easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoidRecommendedCFH So Convenient Recommended,positive
Nice product I like the great feel as the handle angle is large and makes it very easy to remove Great product,positive
I bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case I like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases It works okay for 6 string guitars but not even okay for 12 string guitars plus the spring became loose You get what you pay for in this case Use only on 6 string guitars,neutral

Ive tried every gimmicky thing you can imagine and have always gone back to what simply works these Dunlop Tortex 73mm picks Ive tried different brands shapes and sizes and they all just get in the way these arent slick like some of the others they stay in my hand and they wear ok as long as I dont get too wild and if I ever do drop one they show up super easy on the floor due to their bright yellow color I would be lost if they quit making these or changed them any hopefully they dont these are great The perfect picks for me,positive
I have tried a few and this is the one I settled on if you need a multitool The cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up The winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good Best String MultiTool,positive
This is a great quality microphone and at a good price Keep it mind it is XLR for those that havent noticed XLR is a better quality than other connections Its the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone Looking for a good comparison and is MUCH better quality Its flawless in quality and doesnt give any feedback I would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price Great quality microphoneGood price,positive
as I said on my last Dunlop strap reviewI love the Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of themwhen I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment another great strap,positive
Long time Shubb user but decided to try something differentI think Ive found how lazy I am I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the pegheadReaching my hand to an always available position on guitars ie the peghead for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations eg maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room maybe a table or the floor in some other places for the Shubb Convenience won,positive
I like replacing the pickguard and other plastic parts to give my guitars a different look It takes under 40 accessory kit pickguard to give your guitar a make overMoney well spent LIttle money big change,positive
For what this does you cant go wrong for the price I have a small recording setup and play guitar and bass with friends This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording It does all of those jobs well There is no hum when the unit is on I have two small grips thoughand they are minorthe EQ isnt that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like Maybe Im going deaf A nice little mixer,positive

This works great with the Mustang I amp Switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot A great addition to an already great amp At this price its kinda like the amp itself a no brainer It works nice addition,positive
If youve never had a pedalboard before Id say pass on this one and look for one that is more userfriendly The pics and description dont show just how insanely large this is Its too big Patch cables are crap and the power supply didnt seem sturdy enough to be kicked aroundBesides this I had trouble using it even for practice because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedalsI ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator bone and a seperate power supply Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with micscables rather than being a whole suitcase on its own Resist the urge,negative

Totally perfect for holding my guitar Super sturdy easy to put intake out Wide enough stance that you dont have to worry about it falling over on carpet Perfect,positive
Quick and accurate I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though Worth what I paid,positive
I got one of these and now a week later I have 3 what a great learning tool simple and sweet Snark Rules,positive
Im very pleased with this purchase The cables are flexible quiet and no pops or loss of signal Not much else to say Buy them Quiet and great price,positive
so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locksI tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe but alas I was too slowIts a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle capSo the Fender ones will do just fine plus they come in 2 colors and say FenderTime to open another Carlsberg cheers Fender I drink Carlsberg,positive
Work awesome Five Stars,positive
Good Quality cable and price Works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cablesIt does not make any noise Excellent product,positive
I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58 While I did not have either one of those to do an ab comparison I DID have 2 highend over 100 mics to compare these too One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey but far more resistant to feedback even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2 Cant speak to their longevity or reliability yet but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks Great value highly recommended Incredible bang for the buck,positive
I recently ordered 5 different ukulele models while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few optionsOkina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard NaturalDiamond Head DU150 Ukulele NaturalMahalo U30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele OrangeLanikai LU11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under 30 at the time and within 2 price of each other Of the three I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20 and 40yearold ukuleles which had the original strings A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly but even then the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price levelThe Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a nice for this price little gig bag The Mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Heads That being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since its so near the same price compared to the Diamond Head and has heavier strings already installed Ive also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pagesOn an almost irrelevant note the Diamond Head was the only instrument of the 5 to arrive in something close to actual tunedup string tension It takes several days for these nylon strings to stretch and settle in but I didnt have to retune the Diamond Head so much because it was already virtually in tune This would not be my primary concern with purchasing an instrument for myself but may be a significant headachesaver for a nonmusician parent purchasing a ukulele for a young child Nice Ukulele with bag for the price but the Mahalo is a better option,positive
Ive played guitar for 5 years Seen many different capos but none that quite satisfies me as the KyserYou really cant go wrong with this capo It is very mobile easily adjustable sturdy and durableWhats good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo The transparent rubber piece does the same jobIt comes in different colors alsoI own the black silver gold and camo Kyser caposI also own the Cut Capo for other stylesI recommend itAll the capos Ive had from Kyser are still in great conditionsUse them all the time at church and at home Best capo out there,positive
Thought about buying the expensive G7th capo but Im very glad I didnt The tried and true Shubb works great at a great price I dont use it much but its nice to know that when I do I wont have to mess around with or detune to make it sound right The difference between this one and clamp on style is night and day Fantastic Capo,positive
Its a pop filter it works well and does the job However the neck on this thing is a bit long so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way Otherwise its a good option at a good price does the job slightly longer than normal neck,positive
outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with hossen the pedal is everything i expected from it and a little more Good crunch nice light distortion when you want it and it is not at all midrange sounding like a tube screamer A definite improvement on a classic stompbox Nice work Joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist Joyo JF01 Vintage Overdrive,positive
Great tone and tuning stability Was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat Really helped with the bigsby tuning stability Great tone,positive
I couldnt believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price Especially given what I paid for it this case is unbelievable velvety cushioning inside heavyduty outside and a little compartment for picks or capos I cant fit much else in there but I dont really need to A few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze at first I didnt think my Ibanez mandolin fit in here but when I finally applied some pressure it went right in Now that Ive been using the case for a while it seems broken in and I dont have to fight it so much to get it to closeThe only downside is that after a few uses the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge I used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since its on the bottom its not very noticeable but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through I didnt take a star away for that as its purely cosmetic and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin I can forgive some tape on the edge In this case I still got more than my moneys worth Amazing for the price,positive
Ive owned a bunch of tuners over the past 30 years and this one is the best Ive ever had for an acoustic guitar It is easy to operate has a nice large display that you can easily see and its small enough to carry anywhere It is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever Nothing to complain about here 5 stars all the way Best Acoustic Guitar Tuner Ive Ever Owned,positive
I bought this because it was cheap and figured it cant be that bad I was surprised that it was good I had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldnt tell the difference Really good quality for the price,positive
Once I switched to these cables I never use anything else now Great connection sounds good and no issues at all Love them,positive
Use this alot on all kinds of electronics It gets crackling knobs going again Ive use it for years recommend Good stuff,positive
the winder works really well and same with the cutter but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome i guess for taking w you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool but if using at home then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter thats what i do anyway still i think is a good tool to have just ok,neutral
they are just great what more can I say They product is high quality and a good price I am enjoying them picking,positive
The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me but this thing is fantastic clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out only complaint battery doesnt last too long get a power adapter otherwise GREAT PRACTICE AMP Its a Champ,positive
I ordered this so I could plug my guitar into my computer and record music Works well Quality German manufacturing as always Nice I would definitely recommend this It worked with my windows 7 starter Acer netbook Nicee,positive
Ive been using Slinkys for so long now I honestly dont see me using any other brand ever again They are tough well made and simply work and sound greatdo what everyone else does and try them out and see for yourself what a difference a great string makes to your playing The bestNuf said,positive
This item really speaks for itself It is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop The base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy Its a solid piece that serves its purpose and offers convenience for anyone looking to place a microphone on their deskI would recommend you grab a shockmount with this if you dont already have one as it transfers vibrations though the stand But that is honestly to be expected Brass Tacks,positive
Id give this 1 and a half stars if I could This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touchmove a cable plugged into it It is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this I can only hear in one ear in every headphoneoutput and hardly anything in the other I have to always adjust my cables connector to get any full sound for a second I can still use this but hardly I really dont like this Behringer HA400 4Channel Stereo Headphone Amp,negative
Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s Generally Dampits can be used over and over for years Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air This is the first instrumentspecific Dampit product that Ive ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well In addition to the standard Dampit theres a soundhole cover In case it is not clear just how it works the clear soundhole cover has a short string with a loop on the end You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument something very important on a solidtop classical guitar I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the soundhole cover is so convenient hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 4050 humidity Deservedly Long History But With a New Twist,positive
I just got this yesterday so I dont know how long it will prolong the strings life but I have noticed a difference already Its a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone Also its cheap so I would give it a shot if I were you Im really happy that I discovered this product in fact Im already ordering 2 more really makes a difference,positive
I love these strings been using them forever and via Amazon Subscribe and Save I get them for a really good price Love the tone,positive
I just received this mic today and tried it out I purchased it after rave reviews from other Amazon purchasers This is a heavy solid high quality mic Are you kidding me at this low price They giving it away Heck the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and its worth 10 all by itself I recorded a song today with it and I sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping You cant beat this deal Awesome nice mic ARE YOU KIDDING ME,positive
When placing my guitar in a stand on the floor I always worry that someone person or dog will knock it over This hanger works great for hanging my guitar out of the way safe and secure Yes I could put it in the case but when Im playing on and off all day long that becomes cumbersome so this hanger is convenient and secure for my beloved guitar Guitar Hanger,positive
These patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like bandaids kind of a gross plastic smell The smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first Good function but,neutral
This box is small but packs a great punch I dont notice any difference in audio or loss in sound The two dials for MIC and MON levels are nice and stiff and feel like they will lastThis personal monitor station is much smaller than I thought it would be which is definitely not a bad thing The connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only 20If you find you just arent getting enough mic in your headphones grab this ASAP Perfect,positive
Super low capacitance on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami Canare etc The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves superhandy elastic cord wrap These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors but with these I dont see the point The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too of course Amazons return policy is still 30 days so be aware of that youd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange that is if you ever had to My goto instrument cable,positive
Ive been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years Ive learned thisif you are a serious guitar player there are many musthave items you need in your arsenal One of them is a capo By clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in Essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device They are quite common inexpensive and the basic design really hasnt changed in many yearsuntil nowThats where this product comes in This capo is great because it doesnt simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down It has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob The reason this matters is because depending on the guitar sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension or not enough when clamped Too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch Not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes Either one is not good This new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner I highly recommend Improving on an old design,positive
I love these little guys The small size forces me to hold it so just the very tips is exposed They have a nice textured grip I bought the red ones this time so I can see them when I drop them Great little jazz picks,positive
I rarely play with one as I prefer a thin pick and these are more along the lines of medium but when I do pull one out of my pocket to play it always gets attention Definitely novelty picks,positive
Ive never had one of these pots fail on me Never had one go scratchy Im sure they will as most pots will but Ive either been fortunate or these are very well made pots These have always worked flawlessly for me,positive
This microphone clip becomes loose at the hinge very quickly and needs to consistently be tightened Too much of a hassle really Its Alright,neutral
after trying to rig something up I decided to just go with this mount for my Yeti It did not disappoint the fit was perfect install was easy use your logic and the microphone looks sexy as hell on it Finally gave in,positive
Simple and compactNo clicking or buzzingPerfect for old Van Halen solos like in 34You Really Got Me34Plus you can get a swooshing bright sound you cant get with a Flange and Chorus when backing it down and playing cleanPlay some old KISS or some Rob Zombie65 bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser isnt available in most amp emulators34You know your man is working hard hes worth a deuce34 MXR Phaser rules the sound waves,positive
I was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle Combined with the OPTECH work mat that I purchased I can now turn almost any table or bench into a handy guitar workstation In my experience Jim Dunlop always makes good products and this one continues that tradition Great,positive
Ive purchased a couple of of the blue 25 foot mic cords from this seller before same as these Ive had them for well over a year used in live music at least 5 times a month Theyve been stepped on and treated pretty rough They are still supple and easy to wind up In contrast I have other mic cords from a different manufacturer and the set screws have fallen out they are stiffer and just havent held up as well Having the multicolor cords makes it a lot easier to see which channel on the mixer is connected to which mic Very inexpensive yet reliable cord Highly recommended Very Nice Cords,positive
Very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely Especially when you take off the guitar for a break Either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is needed Very Good,positive
This holder and just about every holder Ive ever bought doesnt hold a harmonica at the right angle for me They all need one more joint to adjust the angle Ive had Hohner racks before so I was prepared I use harmonica holders for kazoos This one has a decent spring and may not require the use of duct tape or wire to hold the kazoo in place I may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic The angle for kazoo use is fineObviously not everyones head and neck are the same as mine This holder may work well for harmonica for some people If you can you should try on holders before you buy Not Particularly Good for Harmonica for Me but Not What I Bought lt For,positive
Used on an old tiesco 34 size guitar i refurbished for one of my grandsons Guitar tuned easy and holds tune well He plays it for hours at a time they worked,positive
Strung these up on a Seagull guitar to replace some strings that were several years old and the gauge and action of the guitar killed my fingers so it didnt get played much These strings feel great and sound fantastic Very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows Great sounding strings,positive
No lie these are the perfect strings for an electric archtopSmooth but not dull sounding Will defiantly be buying more Dig em,positive
I wanted an upgrade to my TU2 which I had for years This TU3 is easier to see and is more precise in its tunings I recommend it Oh Yeah,positive
I dont think I can say enough good things about the Samson SP01 Shockmount Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording A shockmount is an absolute must especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surfaceThe build quality is fantastic I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcastWhat Ive grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount Nearly all do but some companies like Blue Snowball snowflake etc are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts I have used the MXL 007USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version The MXL fit like a glove perfect The AT2020 once threaded in seemed just a bit loose so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movementIn short I havent found a better shockmount for condenser mics The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand Fantastic Buy two of these Thanks Samson now just make better mics Superior shockmount fantastic price,positive
Good cable and has m et all of our needs As all of know who use cables only time will tell whether they will last Meet our needs,positive
I bought it by mistake cause I dont own nor play the bass but it works for my guitarfits well good quality too Fits well,positive
I didnt like the arm through one part and your head through the other so I cut it apart and just hang my uke from my neck and the top of the sound hole Works like a charmis more easily adjusted and the felt lined sound hole clip has not damaged my uke at all Simpler would be better,positive
I liked the string spacing on these nuts You could just drop it in and play but you will soon realize it will need some refinement My open B and E strings with somewhat aggressive picking would buzz like a sitar This was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners Some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges The base of this bone nut does NOT have a radius So if your nut slot is radiused you will need to have it done or you will have poor sustain and possibly crack the nut in half at string tension This is more common in vintage guitars thoughMy guitars sustain was definitely improved with this nut I highly recommend it Perfect fit for a standard Strat nut slot,positive
I tried another miniamps but all sounds like toys This is totally different its the real thing Made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound The only thing I dont like is that its hard to get clean tones from it and with a Les Paul its harder beside that its perfect The best,positive
Bought this amp probably about two years ago The amp has 3 levels of 8 presets each for a total of 24 unique presets ranging form heavy metal distortion sounds and reverberating clean tones The 65 Twin Reverb on the Orange Level is by far my favorite The amp includes gain a volume and separate master volume knob in addition to bass and treble knobs I feel like it is a bargain at any price A great amp for practice and beginners Fantastic Amp,positive
Despite the sensitivity of a compressor microphone I still use this to record heavy metal guitar Only thing is I use a small amplifier only a fifteen watt Line 6 spider 3 I can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar Anyways the only thing is when I use recording software I have to not record the guitar too loud And oh my it records good Now I no longer have to record straight into my computer where I get all loud over compressed guitar sound I can record with drum loops and with the microphone it goes into the computer and I no longer get the loud overcompressed guitar sound that I never like very much Glad I purchased this For those who would try this for guitar remember this is a sensitive compressor mic and you will get a very loud recording you will not like So you just record as quietly as you can This mic is sensitive But oh boy I like it Man I can play for hours and the guitar goes way better with the drum loops And as I said before the amp is not gonna be loud enough to bother the neighbors A good buy well worth the price I use this for heavy metal guitar recording,positive
I dont have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes but enough to know when I have a winner Behringers TM300 is made from tough plastic The 3 other Beheringers I have had about a year dont look warn and scarred and sound as good as the day I got them The tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones Fender clean bright British crunch and distortion a hot Gain and sweet smooth California sound I am playing out of a Peavey but I hear a tweed Amazing clarity and worth the 28 and change You wont be disappointed Huge Amp mode effect minor cost,positive
I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck They are a great idea I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap but eventually got it on I have two of these and I use them Id definitely recommend them to anyone who doesnt like tying on their guitar straps Very Handy,positive
This item did the job its made for Made well and you need to make sure you open it fully prior to inserting it onto your guitar neck to keep it from snapping back on you because its strong but it wont damage your guitar and its effective Does the job very strong,positive
I wanted to try the Clayton Beehold picks to see if the hole would help me grip the pick better so that it doesnt rotate in my handThe 80 pick is a little too heavy for my style of playing but the hole is a neat idea and did seem to help a bit but I gave up on the pick pretty quickly due to the stiffness Good picks a little to heavy for my style,neutral
This Fender Treated Polish Cloth a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is asimple product The classic Fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth The resealableplastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read FENPC1 and states its size as being 12 inchesby 15 inchesWell its size as I measured it is actually 12 inches by 1458 inches Just wanted to mention itbecause I have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this Me no problem The missing38 of an inch is a minor detail Go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s Now you wontactually find any actual 2x4s Theyve been shrinking for over 50 yearsI am not sure what this cloth is treated with but it does not feel any different than the UNtreatedGibson polishing cloths I have purchased I also gave it the nose test I thought there might be a hintof or a whiff of some polish or something Nope No scent No whiffWhat I did find disconcerting is the warning in Product Details section on the Amazon web page It isthe fourth bullet down California residents Click here for Proposition 65 warning Below is thewarning verbatim from Amazon Kudos to Amazon for posting this warning Californias Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels We care about our customers safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions We are providing the following warning for products linked to this page WARNING This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm Just thought I let you know about that one I guess the missing 38s of an inch is really no big deal atthis point You just need to worry that in your concerns for keeping your beautiful guitar sparkling cleanyou could get cancer WoW Back to the reviewThe Fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the Gibson cloths but not much differencebetween the two Well the Gibson cloth does have a whipstitch edging around it Other than THAT notmuch differenceWhen I use the Fender cloth on my Fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left I like tokeep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that Idont use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as theneckSo based on the fact that Fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar I will give thisamazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth 4 stars It appears to do what it supposed to doand that is polish your guitar without harming itIt gets one less star because of the California Prop 65 warning I suppose I need to take this a somewhatseriously so I docked it one star I will definitely be washing my hand right after using itSo far no harm has been done to any guitars in the writing of this review For the future I am not so sureabout me Thank you and say Goodnight GracieNote About Vendor GODPS responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time It was 4 dayspast the delivery date I emailed them They responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail tome that came in an appropriate amount of time For such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service I will use them again in the future 1458 X 12 and a Warning Fender Treated Polish Cloth Photos lt,positive
Maybe its because I cut my musical teeth on Motown and 60s rock but Ive always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound or even ground wound strings It might also have something to do with the fact I play upright as well Flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more uprightlike to my ears It doesnt hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever too I use DDaddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as Ive found them to be very consistent from set to set and the sealed plastic packaging means that I can buy a set today put it in my case and its be as good as new a year laterI used to use LaBella flats on my fretless and then switched to Thomastik Jazz Flats Then a friend told me hed switched from the Thomastiks to these He found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well Im now a convert too Excellent strings,positive
I bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs the same heads I bought over a year ago are still sounding great and havent torn these heads are amazing and a very good investment make your kit sound very professional and I just love em to death definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads Indestructible,positive
This particular brand Ive seen around and havent heard to much about them but the one that I got worked fine for about a couple days It went out and I sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that I MIGHT have gotten a bad oneAnd I requested in a letter when I sent it in that they send another one in exchange That didnt work out so well with that being the only way I COULD RATE it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one Id have to rate this one at the bottom Dead Digi,negative
Warm analog delay very natural sound not sterile at all very ez to use no harsh digital BS I like this way better than the BOSS Plus is is MXR and built like a tank to last a lifetime Best sounding delay I have ever used,positive
Terrific way to tray out various picks without committing to a whole pack of something you might not end up liking And high praise for GODPS Music These guys had the product out the door the same day I ordered it sent some great sale information on other gear and included a catalog explaining the specs of all the picks Id ordered I only spent 199 and I really felt like they went out of their way to earn more of my business which they did Great,positive
Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward I may order another if this one performs well Cheap and hopefully effective,positive
I love this stuff Ive tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best And in case you are wondering it comes with a cloth cap attached to the bottle under the twist off cap so all you have to do is turn the bottle upside down and clean away You may need an additional cloth in the beginning to wipe off the excess liquid because the bottle is full when you first get it of course I highly recommend this product Very Good,positive
works greatgreat little tuneri would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed nice little tuner,positive
They do what they are meant to do No complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them They do what they are meant to do,positive
Pretty crappy cable It works and gets the job done but after purchasing this product and using it I will shell out the extra bucks for better quality Eh,positive
I read the reviews on Ernie Ball strings I have to say that I love the strings They have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive Great Acoustic Strings,positive
First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected I give it 4 stars as a microphone period without even taking the low cost into consideration They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra 5 for sure I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go However we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound techs personal SM58s are busy at another job I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500s however they may have moved on now for all I knowThese are not Shure SM58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shures have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eqed correctly They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq It also is if anything more versatile than the SM58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM57 to pick up It doesnt overload easily has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM58 It has a reasonably decent blast filter so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you dont have to add a windscreen Another strength of these is durability My 3 have sustained numerous drops a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall No damage at all to any of them I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise but on the stand handling noise is no issue Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable If you want SM58s you need to buy SM58s If you want a good all around microphone in the 20 to 40 class then try one of these No onoff switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM58s we use and frankly the onoff switch is a liability I dont think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent allaround microphone for the price You can pay more and get less Bargain Microphone or Just a Cosmetic Knockoff,positive
This set of strings is fantastic Ive been playing for over ten years now and have tried everything from Elixirs to DAddario to Martin to John Pearse you see where Im going with thisand many moreI have to say that for the money these strings are in a class of their own When I first started playing I loved the coated strings I wouldnt buy anything but Elixirs for years Then I got married and money became tight and for 15 a pop a set Elixirs wasnt looking as good as they used toSo I tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three yearsI finally landed on these Earthwoods by Ernie Ball AmazingThey are not coated but after a while I got used to that and now actually prefer noncoated stringsThese really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought And the Medium Light set is just perfect Nice size high E string so I dont feel like Im going to snap it when I do a pull off and good bass responseAll in all a fantastic set of strings that you cant afford not to tryAnd at 5 why wouldnt you give them a shot Great Strings,positive
It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk When received the package did not appear to be damaged but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument True bypass no effect,negative
very happy Holds my lies Paul and schechter guitars very well Had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened Great stands,positive
Its a good banjo capo Inexpensive and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune End of story Its a capo,positive
I bought this because I had a new baby at home and this allowed me to practice without rocking disturbing her Its affordable and does the same thing as more expensive adapters Awesome way to practice,positive
I have a Taylor 514 ce acoustic guitar and Elixir Strings are what this very nice guitar came with from Taylor when new I figure they have done the research on what works best and I see no reason for a change other than going fro the extra light strings to the light weight strings The sound you get with the Nanoweb strings are amazing and they enhance the results from an already great guitar They also last a long time before they go dead Elizir Nanoweb strings are top of the line,positive
Im a little surprised at this one Just today I was emailed confirmation that the picks were shipped and I found them in my mail box the same day I like fender mediums because I use them on both bass and guitar Good picks Clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone good picks decent price fast service,positive
Years ago I used the Clayton 34small teardrop34 picks I couldnt tell from the picture that these were full size and I didnt check the size in the description I still had a few of the small ones so I used them as templates to cut these down I would have rated them higher if I could have used them as is Its my own fault for not looking at the specifications I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks but found Dunlop 423R60 060mm Orange Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks 36Pack which are a lot cheaper I had been using 15 mm picks but needed teardrop picks for shredding,negative
What more can you ask for in a pedal that runs you twelve clams and ships for free This is not the highest quality pedal in terms of construction or tones but it gets the job done nicely for cheap If you are just starting to experement with stomp boxes or you are addicted to collecting stompboxes like yours truely you cant go wrong with the FAB line I find the placement of the knobs just slightly annoying but its a nitpick at this price point If you are looking for something like the Boss DS1 this will pretty much cover the bases at less than a quarter of the price of the Boss pedal If you are looking for more of a light breakup kind of box on the cheap get the dano overdrive instead the silver one I also find that for about ten bucks more Behringer makes some great clone pedals Nice for price,positive
My Les Paul is heavy The strap would constantly fall off So I decided to get a set of strap locks These installed in minutes and really dont change the look of the guitar at all You will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap If you dont have locks on all your guitars you cant interchange your straps easily any more so I recommend getting them for all your guitars The other added benefit I found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back With these locks the strap sits away from the guitar so it fixes that problem as well When I buy a new guitar I get new locks Are there better locks out there Im not sure but Im committed now as I wanted the same locks on all my guitars Has never failed me yet I have these on all my guitars now,positive
while learning how to read these things better I picked these up I need to read better becaseu I have 4 Ukuleles all different size and right now my tenor has a wound string on the third string so now I am more careful with buying strings not that a wound is bad I just suck at playing my concert is my favorite and just discovered that it fits in the case I bought for my soprano and I can take it on travel always glad to have a spare set,positive
No complaints at all I use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a Pod Studio UX2 Have had tons of compliments on the sound People cant belive its a 50 dollar mic when I tell them Such a fantastic price on this cant beat it Fantastic Microphone,positive
I PURCHESED THIS BANJO FOR MY PERSONAL HOBY AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL INSTRAMENT THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE Playability IS GREAT ALSO I AM A GUITAR PLAYER FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND I KNOW QUALITY WHEN I SEE IT FOR THE MONEY YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BANGJO FOR BEGINNERS OR JUST ONY ONE WHO PLAYS JOHN R PLAYER IF MANNY STRINGED INSTAMENTS NOT PROFESIONAL,positive
I purchased this item sometime in August and think its pretty good I have not had any problems with it Not that I can remember Pretty simple it does what its supposed to do Hamilton NuEra Tabletop Mic Stand,positive
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country musicthe case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard but for 20 dollars its well worth the price this is a great product and i highly recomend it slap echo,positive
The best nonrackmount reverb I have ever had So many options clean transparent and whisper quiet This is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain The Toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb Excellence once again from TC Perfection,positive
I use this capo all the time on both instruments A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also I did and they love it Kyser Banl Mandolin Capo,positive
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money But all in all works well Good display and very easy to use Good,positive
I have tried many picks in my 25 years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best I have been using Dunlop for the most recent years but these are the best The Carbon Fiber of these Dunlop Jazz III make them as long lasting as you want when playing rock slides and picking they are better than any other material and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz Their grip is excellent and they feel awesome Gotta try them Highly recommended Cheers Best pick ever,positive
I purchased three of these three different colors to make a minisnake for my keyboard to their Dis I typically used Mogami 2524Neutrik but need cakes while in the road I usually roll my own to exact length These have worked well quiet no handling noise seem well built I treat cables well so I dont really test them with under tough circumstances and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future They are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems I recommend them plus for live the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well Nice pieces pleased with the cables,positive
Delivery was Amazon fast installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months and we expect it to continue for years For the price you cant go wrong Mic sound is pristine no noise we use it for vocal recording in studio run it off an MAudio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power Top Recommendation This works,positive
You really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly The single order wasnt really enough to do one guitar and I doubt you could do a bass either I used the copper under a clear pickguard which matched the rest of the guitar pretty closely Then I finished the pickguard compartment and the jack area with aluminum foil tape from my local hardware store Good stuff but,neutral
I love love love these strings Super great sound and super long life Ive had these on my acoustic for over 6 months before and the sound is still awesome Ill definitely only buy these from now on These Strings are Awesome,positive
Not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys YellowThey play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble nontouring musicians opinionAlso its nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer As a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeveIn summary if youre searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably arent reading this review youre out experimenting For others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more Good strings,positive
Its a simple strap button dont know what else to say I cant imagine a strap button not serving its purpose I hate minimum word review requirements Its a strap button,positive
This is the only brand I would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play These are well worth the money Amazing product,positive
Its great if you need to quickly drop your hats but not the other way around I bought this drop clutch because it was cheap and I was on a budget Overall its build is solid the only problem I have with it is having the clutch lock back into place Its great if you want to quickly drop your hats but not so good on coming back up,neutral
The music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion I needed a music stand that could support a note book of music I have assembled over the years This was great I added a clip on LED light as well PERFECT Rugged and practical,positive
I use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar Got tired of losing picks in mid jam digging through pockets scavenging for another pick Now its right there It Works,positive
Wow Very cool gadget and well executed This review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks I have not tried it with other stringed or nonstringed instrumentsThe thing is quick and accurate The display colors are bright and easy to read It does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing In fact if you play a chord it will usually guess the root note of the chord It clips on easily and firmly It is very sensitive I find that I have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work But I can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune usually without having to pluck it again before I have it rightAs an added bonus in my case the color happens to be a great match for an Epiphone SG G400 in Cherry Red Very Well Done,positive
This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesnt really work As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input Input jack bad,negative
I bought this just to see if I might enjoy learning or if my shoulders Im gettin oldlolwould allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice I wouldnt say its agreat instrument but WAY more than I expected for 60 After I changed the stringsI used the extra set that came with it it actually produced decent sound I bought anew bow for 62100 so and found I like the one that came with it at least as muchThe case is excellentIll prob use it with my upgradeSo for the price you really get far more than you pay forps the shoulder rest is kinda useless though Wow,positive
I already had this pedal but needed to add a little delay to two separate channels stereo I liked this delay so much that rather than buy a stereo delay I bought another MXR Carbon Copy Simple Basic Awesome,positive
no problemit came today like the computer said it would the box was mintto my surprise there wasnt even any tape on it I opened it pulled it from its plastic sleeve and set it up on about a minute it was holding a speaker cabthanks again Amazonand why would I shop any where else Pylepro tripod speaker stand,positive
Awesome quality strings Love em Just restrung my 12 string It was a hassle but I got it done nicely Gnarly Strings,positive
What more can you ask for at roughly 2500 This is a very useful guitar compressor It is a simple compressor thats it Easy to understand with responsive controlsI use compressors quite a lot In my PA rack I have a Yamaha rack compressor and an Alesis rack compressor In my home studio there are compressors in my 24 track DAW and in my computer I have the TRacks Deluxe mastering software with several VST classic analog compressors like the Pultec as well as VST optical compressors I only mention these as a way of saying that I am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them I have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratiosattack and release points and I have learned to use them sparringly and with care The Behringer CS400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor It is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp In recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working its not being used correctly The Behringer CS400 is quiet almost transparent unlike the Behringer DC9 I discuss below Yes it is plastic but its fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years If you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long timeIf money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around 7510000 and up KeeleyMXR Digitech etc Unless you go over 10000 I dont think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle If your signal path aready has hum and static this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because thats what compressors dolower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound If you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch this little Behringer CS400 will do itBehringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the Behringer DC9 It is all metal and attempts to clone the classic MXR pedal I personally would stay away from this pedal for live use I bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain You can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference I dont use the DC9 when I play live but I like it on my guitar when I record using my VOX VT30 amp I like it better than the built in compressor on the VT30 Does the job A simple compressorperfect for guitar,positive
These things are so great I get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and Id have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick With these I can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere The 88 thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups Very nice One thing yo note is they like to cling to each other so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it but not that big a deal Definitely recommend these if youre sick of picks slipping out of your hands Greaaaat picks,positive
This is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrestThe height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved I am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle The seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne I apologize but that is my best reference for comparisonAssembling is simple and fast I had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances I managed to get it done with no problemsAnother thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists The foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals However this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good postureI used this with drums but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bitThe final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport Its not a deal breaker On the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience Solid construction and ergonomically sound,positive
I dont know how much you can say about picks but this is a versatile pack You get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness If you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks this is for you Nice variety,positive
I had just bought an electric acoustic and while I was ordering that I just went ahead and picked one of these up as well because I figured what the heck its under 20 and maybe my full size acoustic might work well with it So I got it and th only thing I had an issue with is that it slide around a little too easily but it does work well I recommend it for those who are looking for a simple solution to making their acoustic electric so that they can play it through their amp Works well considering the low price,positive
For players that want a high quality guitar strap that weighs almost nothing last forever stays in place and has classic good looks there is not a better strap than Levys natural leather suede strap without the piping and stiched edge The dying of the suede side is deep and flawless and the strap is a quality piece of hide without bulk or unnecessary weight from padding Feels great to the touch and you quickly forget that its even touching your shoulder It can be a little bit of a chore to get strap locks on but once on I have never had any worries or failures so that my guitars are nick and ding free Plenty of color choices This is a simple elegant strap that inspires envy Planet wave has a nice strap that is the only one Ive seen and owned that even comes close but there is no other suede strap that is even in the same ball park as the Levy MS26 I own 4 and they are admired by everyone who sees them and slips them over their shoulder It could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps It did for me The best guitar strap made,positive
They are half the size of a regular pick Bit too thick for me Sound nice Will last forever Wish I had sized them before I bought them Too small,neutral
im a beginner on play guitar and most time i play strumming in church praise team when i play faster songs thick gauge picks are very easy to lose so i like to play with thin gauge picks i have used the 046mm whiteone and i want to make the guitar sound more brighter i pick this gray one and i played last friday and sunday worship it made sound that i desired and it wouldnt fly away from my hand while i was plying fast praise songs play like porsche pick wouldnt fly away,positive
I got one of these here on Amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp an older Fender 25 watt blackface twochannel that didnt have integrated EFX that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my churchGreat little amp Only had it for a couple days but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing Clean tones are pristine Distortion tones a bit on the transistory side but again I havent played with the setting enough or even tried all the emulations Controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on It is a bit lacking in lowend to be expected from a small 8 speaker But that is okay for practice and rehearsal It is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer depending on the style of music I did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any TWO settings you defineHave not had a chance to mess with the included software but intend to do that when I have time I like the fact that I can tweak the amp to my EXACT preferences and it stays in memory I only really have to do it once Great featureOnly suggestions to Fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord standard computer type and optionally the included USB cableOverall for the price it is an incredible value Great alternative to lugging my full rig Marshall 2X12 cab racked Rocktron Pirhanna ADA 100 watt tube head Alesis Midiverb IV and some other stuff Get yours while you can at this priceUPDATE The Fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing I now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via USB and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET I am going to buy a second one probably the larger Mustang III cause I want the larger Celestion speaker You know pretty much every Fender product I have ever purchased has been first rate and this amp is no exception And I dont care if it is made in Mexico my guitar is a differnt matter though Amazing little amp,positive
Perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike As strictly an issue of natural acoustics I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitars output and resonance I have an Aria AD80 which is a very wellmade Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D42 It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a sound canon for its great natural volume Adding the OPort deadened the lows It just didnt provide any plus at all anywhere else It is however pretty inexpensive so if youre a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself its not going to break your bank But again if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person voiced it in his or her manufacturing process this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything Im an acoustic nut and Id love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box The Oport seemed to corral the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole Sorry to be a crab about itI like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the Humidipak recall a few years back But this product was a waste to me Sorry Waste of money for me,negative
These are great little tuners You can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly which is especially helpful when youre breaking in strings or any time Ive played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strummingSO these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts Perfect tool for its purpose,positive
I havent picked up a guitar in 15 years but this was a LONG Winter and I needed something to occupy my timeI broke out my Strat and discovered that the amp was dead mice had eaten the wiringCrapSo Online to see what defined State of the Art This is ItIf you need a basic practice amp that with a decent laptop and internet connection can help you produce ANY sound with a few simple instructions THIS IS ITNo Foot pedals or expensive addons until you really have to have them Just pure creative sound that wont break the bankBuy This Amp Best Purchase YET,positive
Ive been hooked on DAddarios for quite a while The perunit price on these is great and I never worry about breaking one of these Some of the best strings,positive
Wow This little amp packs tons of tone sound Hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully The clean channels are really clean the dirty channels are just plain nasty 75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off Lots of bang for the buck here Great small amp,positive
I had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things Needless to say the strings were at least 5 years old and I was about to replace them with new ones but thought I would give this a try I am amazed at how good the strings feel now They really are like a new set of strings Saved me 20 bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves My only reason for knocking off 1 star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be They could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done Like a new set of strings,positive
I bought this to replace the inexpensive Musedo T50 tuner that came bundled with my Kala KAS ukulele The Snark SN2 is much more accurate but its LCD display is not very bright and has a narrow field of view Yes I did try a fresh battery but it made no difference I wish it were brighter and easier to see Still its a very good tuner overall Works well but could be brighter,positive
This pedal work although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal even running the delay on the output side of the M195 The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig when using fuzz and distortion Works,positive
Its comfortable Its adjustable The color was a good match for the guitar Unless you regularly gig for hours at a time why spend 50 smackers on a strap when this one does just fine Put the dough into the guitar not the strap By several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time Nothing Fancy More Than Does the Job,positive
These picks are perfect They are just the right feel for medium and look awesome What more can you say about picks other than they are perfect wonderful,positive
I did get 5 thumb picks in my order a previous reviewer mentioned only getting 4 and I always really liked the classic turtleshell look far more purtylike than the plain thick white of Nationals and others But these are large And yes I double checked the packaging to ensure I was shipped large The National mediums I was using before had a looser fit boggle But nevertheless the Planet Waves far tighter fit actually feel better than the National mediums which certainly had a clunky sensation there is probably a small weight difference between the two that would explain the overall feeling of quicker movement while having good solid interactions on the strings All in all 4 stars Still these were a large Hate to see how the mediums fit So this is a Large size,positive
If you play a string instrument this one is a must I have several and a Snark for each one Unfortunately in the span of about two years theyve gone from about 6 in bulk to about double that Its a good product but shop around wisely for the best price and hint read the fine print if they include a battery youll pay lots more I even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store Five stars for performance take away one for greed And another comment in 2013 I decided to buy 4 more but went to another source which only charged ONE shipping price not 4 Great product too bad theyre going up up up,positive
A little small for my taste very thin but works well and Dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician A little small,neutral
My son plays electric and acoustic guitar He uses Elixir for both and swears by them He has had other brands but they just dont stand up to elixir Great strings,positive
I used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from Paul Gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of 1mm These things are great and yes I can shred faster now Just about perfect,positive
In case you were wondering this is a clone of the Boss compressorsustainer It does a very good job reproducing the original at a fraction of the cost You add noise to your chain with any compressor because thats what they do they elevate quiet signal and minimize volume spikes to even it all out When it is off this thing had pretty decent bypass but I would not string an entire board together with pedals that are not true bypass because it would suck tone The box is plastic but it is solid ABS plastic and is perfectly adequate Ive not yet heard of a Behringer stomp box failing because the plastic box crushed when someone stepped on it People do like to complain about the battery cover being annoying and I have to say arent they all Seriously when you can hook up a daisy chain and not ever have to deal with a dead battery ever again in your life what are you complaining about The knobs are solid and work just fine I own like a dozen of these cheap Behringer pedals and I have never had a problem with any of them You get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box PriceValue ratio deserves 5 stars,positive
Admittedly I dont use these on my high end stuff I use these on my cheap axes to bang on Why The are strong durable and sound good The tone isnt as pure as some other strings on the market but for the cost they do the job The really good strings I typically have to change often as I like a light stringThese hold up well taking a good bend and beatingIf you have a teenager who isnt light with the pick or if you have something you tend to get very aggressive with these are perfect5 stars for what they are great strings great price,positive
These strings I put on my Taylor GA4E They had a very nice and balanced mids and highs These strings fit very nicely for a acoustic guitarist that is playing with a bassist and supporting instruments These strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely Nice mids and ringing highs Not a lot of bass But very nice balance as I said YMMV Not bad,positive
This is a great basic mic stand for live and studio use although I dont suggest using this and playing guitar Great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments it does not come with a mic clip so youll need to get one its a great deal buy it Good stand,positive
I chose this for its good looks but was pleased by its construction as well A very wellmade strap with great looks and a super price My only complaint which is very minor is that I think the webbing could be thicker and have a more sturdy feel It just feels lighter than I like but thats a personal thing I have no complaints about the construction the looks or the price I use mine on an Irish bouzouki and it really looks great and works great I dont like straps that have smooth liners that allow the strap to slide around This cloth doesnt slide around and thats a good thing Great vintage strap for a great price,positive
This capo seems to handle quite nicely Spring loaded trigger like a Kyser still my personal fave but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring In time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune The only issue if you could call it that was that I have always used the Kysers that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one after many years of playing muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly Nice Capo,positive
3 long 3 short Drop in replacement for both my MIM and MIA strat Added mass easier to tune Good cheap easy upgrade Drop in replacement for both MIM and MIA strats,positive
I have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these Planet Wave Picks are much nicer than the others They are clean cut smooth finish Nice texture and looking I reach for these firstWould and will buy again and recommend A nice pick good feel,positive
I owned this pedal for many years before finally trading it in on some other equipment It produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing The sound it does very well is the late 60searly 70s fuzz sound White Room Black Curtains Satisfaction Ina Gadda da Vida Note this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack As such it will not really do the Whole Lotta Love sound As I said it does one thing very well but its range even with classic rock is quite limited If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound this pedal gets you 100 of that sound If you want to also cover other classic rock youre gonna need at least one more overdrivedistortion effect One trick pony but its a good trick,neutral
I like the picks a lot They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape Recommended Great,positive
I love it and there are a lot of bold type enhancements to my acoustic now the chicken picken is much fun and I am still experimenting AS with all digitech pedals I just seem to love their ease of operation the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible main squeeze,positive
This my second Hosa guitar cable The other one is shorter Like my first Hosa cable this is a high quality item Id definitely buy more cables of this brand Nice Cable,positive
Addario strings are ok Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder Aquila seems to be the most popular now I have used both and I am satisfied with bothI play the soprano concert tenor and baritone Each one different in it on rightAlso play the the concert scale banjolele Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times Getting strung along,positive
Good little instrument to pass the time with while setting on a porch or at a campfire with friends Buy this I feel like a blues brother,positive
I havent used it a lot yet but I really like it so far Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using and it works for my guitars and my banjo without putting them out of tune It seems to be solidly made as well and not too much pressure as others said My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does P and was much heavier Id assume it was made out of CastIron or something instead of Aluminum I like this capo so far,positive
This is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for 300 bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers bad ass high quality guitar that is worth every penny,positive
TC makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank Ive had it for over 2 years and done many gigs and a couple tours and all my TC pedals are in perfect condition Now for tone this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when Im leading worship n my band we play heavier music so I was messing around with this overdrive so I could use it there as well and I discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal it makes your tone really muddy but if you send a dirty tone overdrive or light distortion into it it screams beautifully TC Electronic MOJOMOJO Overdrive,positive
There really does not need to be a 10 page review that breaks this thing down to every tedious detail This is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar and tunes it in perfect pitch For a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat These are a staple on every single guitar in our band Bright and easy to read Best headstock tuner Period,positive
This is an inexpensive sturdy sustain pedal that I immediately buy every time I get a new Yamaha keyboard This pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano much better than any footswitch Only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity it may or may not work properly with nonYamaha keyboards Great sustain pedal for Yamaha Keyboards,positive
I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars but thought I would just be careful with it But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes In fact I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head The string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works and though it is a tighter fit than I expected it does work and means I dont need to find a pliers Overall I am very pleased and saved time on string changes Great Tool for guitar owners,positive
I havent owned my electric guitar for over a year but Ive only replaced its strings once Ive been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new At this rate it seems that the current strings I have installed would last forever Would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set Lasts a really long time,positive
Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue adhesive during installation You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar Going to get them for all my guitars,positive
serves the purposeI NEEDED A STAND AT HOME AND THIS DOES JUST FINEI LIKED THE PRICE I WOULD PREFER THE CRADLE NOT TO SWIVEL BUT I AM HAPPY guitar stand,positive
Its really not a 200w system The booklet even says it is only 100 watts and I doubt it is really even that powerful The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar but its not 100 watts loud I guess its OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals Its really not a 200w system The booklet even,negative
I needed this balanced cable to connect a clipon mic pickup for my acoustic guitarIt works perfectly and my recording are rich and fullGreat price too Good quality good price,positive
It really makes your guitar shine Also I use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny 5 stars Also the price is right Nice product,positive
Sounds like a great concept and they seem well made I just dont care for them I know others love them so I guess its just a personal thingIt took weeks to receive them in the US Dont be in a rush Not crazy about them and took a long time to arrive in the US,positive
I once dreamed of something like this around 1979 when Guitar Player magazine had a plan to build such a thing It has 9 volt battery adapaters so that if you have a few MXR pedals from 1979 they will work on this setup for those who have 9 volt power adapters of the more modern kind they fit these too I got all sorts of stuff plugged in mini amp flanger has AC equalizer compressor fuzz wah Love my gizmos Say good bye to batteries This is very affordable too given the high number of effects it will supply I could find nothing better on the market for the price and features So versatile heaven sent,positive
Very nice strap is comfortable as this type of strap can be it will with heavier guitars feel like its wearing on you after about an hour I ended up switching to their padded strap I still think this is a great strap and use it on a lighter guitar now Well Made,positive
A VERY handy item Great for sitting by your practice amp when you dont want to be bothered with stepping all over your 10footers The wire could be a little heavier but you cant beat the value The plugs are the standard screwdown type with well soldered joints Ive used this now for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord Handy and a good value,positive
In fact its beautiful and totally functional The only reason it gets four stars is due to the fact that it doesnt come with a felt washer to protect your instrument and I had to fashion one myself Id buy it again but they should really include a washer very nice strap button,positive
I dont gig It is unlikely that I will ever play in front of a crowd But if youre like me play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres this amp is a blast It is very likely that I will play a Johnny Cash song on Tuesday and a Metallica song on Wednesday Pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound No pedals no hours of minor tweaks just punch it up and learn the song Virtually every genre is represented here I also have to mention that although I like metal I rarely play it I prefer traditional RnR sounds and the Spider IV recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds Even with the best modeling in the world my Les Paul does not sound like a Strat being played through 65 Fender It sounds digital No getting around itSomething else that weighed into my purchase was durability Although I only play for fun I still play 23 hours a day My 9 year old also is learning to play so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily The one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of Line 6 amps was that they were long lasting and durable I have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger 120 just becuase they can take such a beatingUltimately I decided that for the price 300 at the time I couldnt beat the Line 6 There is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp They sound better more prefessional They are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes Although the Line 6 sounds tinny and at max volume for in home play it sounds terrific There are mountains of reviews that compare the Line 6 to Vox Marshall or Fender They are ALL better than the Line6 every one of them But be prepared to pay 10 times the price for effects pedals head units cabinets cables etc to get those flawless professional sounds Good amp great value The Hobbyists Dream Amp,positive
I love the idea that you dont need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick Further it will not add something else to findloose in my pants pocket Love the concept,positive
Thats why I got thisI needed light without the heat It works fine Just sorry its a little pain to keep taking battery out if I want to use the AC connection Other than that its fine and pretty well constructed Seems to take a few bangs without problems Wonderful and bright did I say BRIGHT but NOT Hot,positive
As with all Dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional It does what it is intended to do holds my picks It actually works well The picks go in and come out nicely Good Pickholder,positive
This is an awesome amp There are SO many settings on this amp you could spend hours with news sounds and effects so sick Its fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new Sometime I want to get the pedal for this amp to preset effects I like Great amp if youre just looking for something to either mess around on or practice with I play a lot of different songs on my electric guitars and this amp makes it really fun I would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player Freakin awesome D,positive
IVE ALWAYS TUNED MY UKULELES BY EAR NO PROBLEM BUT I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SOPRANO UKULELE FOR MY GREAT NIECE AND KNEW I COULDNT ALWAYS BE THERE TO TUNE IT FOR HER I WAS LEARY ABOUT THE USE OF THE SNARK DESPITE READING MANY FAVORABLE REVIEWS PRAISING IT BUT IM NOW A CONVINCED SNARK USER SO SIMPLE SO EASY TO USE SO ACCURATE SO LIGHT PLUCK A STRING AND TUNE IT TO THE DIAL AND EUREKA SUCCESS BUY ONE YOULL LIKE IT THE SNARK UKULELE TUNER IS A DELIGHT TO USE,positive
This came in the mail today in a rather large box The blue LED light is fine you can put about 5 medium picks in the Pick holder More than enough to keep me and a friend in picks for a few songs It is not bad but I dont think I would purchase another one Good little lightbut the fob is not the best,positive
Overall dimensions 6 34 x 6 12 x 2 14 Very nice travel size Sound is about what you would expect It is basically a toy If you use more than 2 of 10 max gain it sounds awful I turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level Tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies I am using it with a Fender Starcaster when I travel for work hotel friendly I think its over priced but I think it looks good and it seems durable Dimensions of Amp,neutral
I love these pedals Inexpensive to purchase easy to mod to your likingThis pedal received the gain and JCM modI will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of themThis pedal is also good stock for a lead boost Love this pedal Great pedal,positive
I always keep a lot of these on hand These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars strumming style vocals Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks These definitely last longer for me than other brands similar weight that I have used For example I can 34roundoff34 the end off a Musicians Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks The weight is great for my style of playing They seem more durable than other brands Theyre inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand I love em use them daily and rely on them Only Picks I Use for Acoustic Strumming Style,positive
I bought this for my Takamine EGSF15SC acousticelectric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very wellI am very happy with the low price I got and am very pleased with the overall quality of this caseIt has exceeded my expectations Great case at a great price,positive
this tremolo arm needed to be bent outwards a bit in order for it screw down enough while still clearing the volume and tone controls overall a pretty good purchase pretty good,positive
Works great for what it is designed for Works perfect,positive
What can I say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place they fit in the factory hole without a problem nothing fancy they just work screws,positive
So if you want to play just in your garage this is really good for the priceI like it its ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion If you like warm sounds you should see something else Good,positive
i love it im using this mic to record my vocals for my home made demos it works just awesome quality and price im just satisfied awesome,positive
Item body is plastic rather than metal This is to be expected at this price I would not call it sturdy but at least its 25 instead of 125 and it works Professional musicians may not be impressed as there are some occasional noise issues as Ive found to be true with many Behringer products Nevertheless for what it is it works reasonably wellReceived this item in good time Theres only one real dislike I have about the item The battery access is goofy To access the battery one must take the foot pedal off by inserting an ink pen into the hinges Two hinges two hands a tricky process at best Not the easiest battery access Ive ever seen However to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable I became relatively skilled at it in short timeInitially the product didnt work All I could hear was static out of the amp and thought I had a defective unit But then I noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box Turned it down and the sound got much better Traced an additional problem to an old unshielded guitar cable replaced that with a good one and sound smoothed outThis is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range It has excellent Bass and Treble tuners It did seem to be somewhat sensitive to movement noises so apparently there is no noise filter of any kind in the box Jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cutout That could be cord issues or box issues Ill experiment more laterIt does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment Behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why But once the sound comes out its difficult to discern the hiss its not extremely loud or annoying its just thereBottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price It does the job and should work fine for most instances where such a device would be needed such as with passive pickupnon powered acoustic instruments Id recommend it for those who need such a thing simply because of the relative ease of use foot petal onoff switch and the relative low costIts just soso in my estimate but in some cases soso is good enough It works with proper care,neutral
This is a nice pick holder especially for the price It sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use Works well,positive
The pedal works as described The draw back is the battery installation You have to take the pedal off to access the battery The other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use I purchased a power supply to go along with it The problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for Its ok for the money and works good I run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound I am looking for I mainly use it with a large body 34F34 hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings The lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth Priced right,neutral
The guitar picks were exactly what I was looking for I like hard picks and these were the ones I needed Great guitar picks,positive
This is the best capo Ive ever owned Its a little awkward in that it doesnt just clip to the headstock with one hand and it takes me two hands also to put it on but not having to retune my 12string makes it all worthwhile I like the choice of colors too Great Capo,positive
These strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good If you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced Saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the playerSo I and many others play nickelBullet end If you are playing a Stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a wholeThose two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time Ive been using these for years have proven to me to be the optimal string for the StratocasterThese are durable Do they last Well yes they do I rotate guitars on the gigs so I would say that if I was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as I do through the week I end up changing them out every 2 to 3 weeks and Im playing 4 nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and I put them through a rigorous workoutWhat would that equate to in hours Hmmm 60 to 80 hours perhaps maybe a bit more Add to that sweat natural oils oxidation and that I dont use cleaners or chems on the strings although I do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel Pure Nickel Bullets,positive
Does what it is designed to do it holds about 6 picks Small piece of adhesive tape on the back The supplier refunded some of the postage Amazon promised to credit my account 10 credit never appeared for the highly inflated shipping costs A 2 item cost 1770 for shipping Be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order Simple and effective,neutral
TheDanelectro Honeytone Mini Amp Beatnik Burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar The color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color Paired with the Zero Hum AC Adaptor its a highly portable amp setup Ultraportable by using a 9V battery instead of the AC adaptor I do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig thoughA headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amps impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouseIncluded with the amp is an Owners Manual with simple startup instructions Youll need to have your own cord the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isnt provided as part of the amp package The manual has several control settings for the following sound tweaksClean SpankyWarm JazzBig Amp OverdriveKiller BluesDistorted RhythmThick SoloWoodstock FuzzSend the Cats Under the BedTwangMondo SustainBrit Solo TuneSparkle CleanEarly 80s Clean SoloLate 60s Neck Solo70s Brit70s SoloI paid under 20 for this amp and couldnt be happier with the product Dont hesitate to pick one up for yourselfUPDATE 71912There is a space in the back of the unit for 1 9volt batteryDuracell 9V Alkaline Batteries 4Countor you can use the included AC adapter to power the ampUPDATE 91912 Per reviewer Paul Stewart As a point of clarity the current version of this item does NOT ship with an adapter nor cable Be prepared to purchase these in tandem FYIUPDATE 111713Almost 4 years ago I bought this item and its still going strong Great dealUPDATE 71114YUP Its still kickin along Super buy on this miniamp Impressive Sound from an Inexpensive Source UPDATE 71114,positive
Ive been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between Over the years Ive tried several different brands of string The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them Its just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel the Martin string sets relatively low cost is a nice bonus The Best of the Lot,positive
I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900 Its a big step up from that one I am pleased with it The old one had a lot of handling noise This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it My next one will be an SM58 but that will be awhile from now Im very happy with this PG58UpdateDecember 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider It would keep me from buying another one of these Other mics I own dont have this problem to this degree Good Mic,positive
Ive had a few of these things not all the same model This one was hard to read I changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit Overall I like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal I Like It,positive
Whats not to love about these strings The sound is fantastic they ring like they should But my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long Great strings,positive
This hand full of picks saves your fingernails they are not the best but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size I am used to A hand full,positive
I just picked up a Pod HD500 and I love it Of course a couple days later they announced the HD500x but it doesnt look like theyve made any major changes Anyway if youre thinking of getting one here are my thoughts in no particular orderThis thing is versatile You can use it in a number of different ways Just as an effects board with 8 customized effects with effects and amp sims as a midi controller and as a recording interface to name a fewLine 6 gave you access to the guts Everything is tweakable assignable and flexible They trust their users to read the freaking manual Im amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs Want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay No problemoFor live performance this thing would be perfect It allows you to organize your presets in Set Lists and name everything whatever you want You can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselvesWhile not all the effects are my cup of tea in particular some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear there are enough options to make anyone happy For example I love the distortion I get from the tube compressor with the drive turned upThe built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects Fantastic Its built like a tank Metal exterior everything feels solid and like it will last longer than I willIf youve got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance take a look at these and the new 500x version Just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates not to mention the amps would cost you more money assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones Truly a great piece of gear Line 6 must love me I sure love this effects board,positive
i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better dealbehringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and qualitythank u guys great for my acoustic guitar,positive
Bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design Works great and base is out of your way Much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around The standard,positive
Ive used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting This one is the worst The plastic screw yes plastic that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to is completely incapable of supporting its own weight at nearly any angle Badjust badSecondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement After twisting on it twice I stripped it out Now the thing is worthless Im returning it ASAPI would rather go to a ladys bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6 pop filter If you dont youll wish you did Avoid this one like your motherinlaw,negative
I bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly The holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender partIt isnt completely black though There is a white stripe running around the outer edge Not a problem for me but it may be for some Its a backplate,positive
Good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly Mostly for Electrics I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric Fender Good picks mostly for the Electrics,positive
A great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality if you dont have something heavy on the flat end the rubber piece moves and before you know it your axe is on the ground I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight but Im not so hot with that idea especially if the can is open The lip need to extend down longer and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around If I had a permanent place to mount this Id gorilla glue it down but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and Ill get an extra guitar stand instead Good idea but it doesnt work Good idea in theory but Im tired of my guitar falling over,negative
great rack small enought to fit on top of a table or under it light weight but holds a lot at some point I had 2 behringer amps power conditioner and 2 single unit audio processors good deal for the money,positive
Ive played guitar for some 35 years and have found DAddario strings to be of consistently good quality They are one of maybe three companies I trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument Whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel their strings produce excellent sound and are durableLike any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style That comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing But Ive never played a set of this brand that I didnt like They always provide vibrant tonal qualityAnd no I dont work for DAddario just a longtime fan Its DAddario,positive
Quality is there in construction and signal passing We never have problems with our Monster gold cables Conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically Get what you pay for This is quality,positive
I am extremely happy with this product I own several shoulder rests and this quickly became my favorite and stays on my favorite violin I have no problem whatsoever keeping it on the violin as long as its in the proper position The adjustability is a key factor and I can turn one side low and the other side higher for a highly customized fit The padding is also excellent and comfortable A topquality product Excellent shoulder rest at a great price,positive
This pedal is supertons of verb if you want it makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this I highly recommend digi stuff I have this coupled with other pedals and a Jamman stereo and it is awesomethanks love shopping through Amamzon digiverbdigitech,positive
These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings I use the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads Great for my Gibson Hummingbird,positive
It is a string winder what more can I say It works as it should and saves time Very useful when restringing a guitar Works fine,positive
Not much to say about patchesthey havent given me ANY trouble which is as good as it gets with cables works fine inexpensive,positive
Having to send the first Snark SN8 back but the replacement thus far has been flawlessI made a slight adjustment to my guitars truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot onA couple tips to tuning a guitar tune it like you play it If you strum play softly then pluck tune each string softlyHowever most people dont play softly so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out so they are generally tuning each string as it begins softly resonatingSo in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flatTo tune your guitar correctly you really ought to pluck each string hard like every 2 seconds and tune it that way rather than waiting for the sound to fade out If you do it this way you might be surprised at how good it sounds when youre strumming the living daylight out of itAlso please check your intonation Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings You pluck your open string hard tune as described above Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DONT TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK on the same string but 12th fret and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT sameIf they are off 12TH open then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment Please dont pay someone to setup your guitar You can do it yourself so easily Go on u toob and search scott grove tuning your guitar wrong and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3000 guitars he spends almost an hour explaining all the details Also watch his video on how to setup adjust intonation truss rod action etcBtw if you cant get your Snark to tune your guitar hint its not the tuners fault The first 3 saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down Then your next 3 strings d a e should also look like another staircase going down If not break out your philips head tweak your intonation Love my SN8,positive
Its really flexible on how youre planning to put on top of it The only small con is the top surface you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything I put my guitar amp head around 40lbs I think and two monitor speakers without a problem Love it Great versatile stand,positive
This is an good stand for situations where there arent too many threats to your guitar running dogs on the porch reeling drunks at a bar Get a heavier stand or a wall hanger if you have a fabulous vintage Martin or a handmade Henderson Overall well worth the price Pretty good little stand,positive
This stand is small compact and sturdy It holds my tenor uke just fine and when folded fits into the pocket of my uke case Its perfect to take along to a gig or practice and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down Just what I wanted,positive
I like to attach ALL of my guitars by the neckheadstock instead of using thetop button and have just used the typical shoestring in the past but no moreOnce you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhereI have a few of these installed on guitars and one bass I play a lotThey obviously give a lot more support than a string and will not dig in tothe finish as a string mightGive it a try you just may like the way the guitar sits as you dont get the neckdrop that comes with just attaching to the body of the guitar Perfect for electric guitar,positive
I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings They dont have as nice and clear a tone as my daddario or curt mangan strings nor do they have the life expectancy however they are cheaper and really easy to bend Since I cant afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time I go with these when Im practicing They do break alot when I play some crazy solos which blows and is the main reason why Im not giving them 5s No its not my technique Ive never broken a string on any other brand strings Ive tried When Im in the studio recording I prefer like I said before Daddario or curt mangan strings however to save money I practice with these strings and I think its not a bad method as I go through strings like doritos I eat doritos alot Good for backups,positive
Fantastic strap Nope it isnt leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff But it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my CCOT banjo that has a really tight spacing all the others I tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets Had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass once again extremely comfortable and sturdy so had to buy another so I can just have one on each Just bought my 2nd one,positive
Ive used this mic with my Tascam US800 Audio Interface and PC to record a high school chorus concert and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone and one as a pianoinstrument microphone and have gotten great results from both The reproduction of the sound was very good The mic seems very solid in build and able to possibly take a little abuse which is good with a travelling recording system but I definately wouldnt TRY dropping one even though theyre a nice metal case and metal grill Id recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals and instrumentals on a budget I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps but thats my next step as well as drums Great mic,positive
Theres just no way Im going to give five stars to a piece of rubber Thats what this is It doesnt even look quite as good as the picture largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up Without those picks its just black molded flabThe damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful I bought this on a whim and cringed when I opened up the box But for the last two weeks its been propping my Takemine up against a coffee table The rubber is thick enough and nonskid enough that it keeps the guitar in place Effortlessly It may not be much to look at but it works really wellThe top portion that rests on a table surface is about 14 inch think Theres a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place Thats about 58 inch thick The cost of materials is probably not more than 50 cents but its the design that sells this thingIf you can find this for less at a local shop go for it I paid Amazon 6 Even at that I consider it a good buy An inexpensive but functional piece of rubber,positive
Im going back to what works best for me Martin SP custom light While the packaging sealed for each set is a good thing and also the individual color coding of each string I do prefer Martins I liked them but,neutral
Its oilwhat more do you wantTurn upside down squeeze hard use your 34man34 level strength and soon the tip will darken apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion IMMEDIATELY wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away Let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with clothIts okay to soak the wood as long as its momentary Dont saturate the fretboard and walk away wood absorbs oil too much oil absorbed fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling losing shape and flatness Not a good situationLemon oil isnt like other oils it isnt very slippery and kind of makes things grabby Its oil but it actually works more like a solvent cleaning things and making them sqeaky cleanlike your fretshint hintJust be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you restring and youll be a happy camper Easy to put on due to ingenius applicator tip,positive
This little tuner is sweet I put it on my stratstyle guitar and it works brilliantly Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics but for the 6in line guitars its perfect It is very precise and accurate leading you to perfect tuning every use I totally recommend this product you wont be dissappointed Sweet Little Tuner,positive
Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply I didnt see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase nor in the package This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics Wheres my power supply,negative
A good tool for study and applying to your music Keep on hand to help understand theory Also great for those starting out learning an instrument Good tool,positive
I agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup It has a very natural sound is reliable and amazingly strong The suction cup issue is easy to solve it just needs to be a bit humid and it will stay well I also bought for comparison the Cherub WCP60G which is not bad but has much more of an unnatural metallic sound plus it seems more feedbackprone than the AXL I can only recommend if you have a nice classical guitar and want to amplify it with true sound the AXL is an excellent and inexpensive solution I doubt that the 200 stuff is much better works excellent,positive
Simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capoThis is the original Shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar Heritage Cherry Sunburst aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar Vintage Sunburstelectrics The primary use is for a Laguna acousticFollow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension Its key to not get too much tensionWeve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo Mostly it goes in a pocket Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesnt clamp tight on the headstock Not a huge deal but a consideration Simple Well Built Works,positive
Inexpensive Light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar Folds up and can easily be stored Highly recommend this for the guitar player Great product,positive
Ive seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before so im going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything Its pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones so with that Im going to say youre either going to get a great product or something that you cant even use In this case you can look forward to getting a great product here The stool is very sturdy no rocking no swaying no moving at all Very comfortable in fact my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me Worth the money great product Solid Sturdy and Comfortable,positive
Was using a box and this is a great help My stomach doesnt feel wrenched anymore I use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg Maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me Works great,positive

Bought this to use on my 1962 Strat Reissue After a year or so of playing the rosewood fretboard become a little dried out and rough of course covered with 100 hours of grime and sweat This kit has everything you need to make your guitar feel look and play like new I put new strings on after using this and man Felt just like the day it arrived from the factory Can slide and play much smoother with this Serious speed improvement Awesome cleaner Rejuvenate your guitar,positive

This is actually my first experience with a Biyang pedal I heard good things about the build quality but didnt end up with a Biyang until I needed a reverb pedal Turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal Most of the popular options or 100 and upAt around 5999 the TriReverb has a distinct advantage in price but dont underestimate its quality As some other reviewers noted the reverb can get EXTREMELY deep and lush if you so desire I found myself with the Blend and Time knobs around 30 for a practical spring reverb Theres a multiswitch for Hall Spring and Room There are subtle differences between the three but Id be lying if I said they sounded dramatically different The AB switch isnt well explained but if youre in A mode the effect is much more dramatic I found that operating in B mode was similar to the type of reverb I had enjoyed on my amps Note it has a stereo input and output but I only use one InputOutput so I cant comment on thatAt the end of the day its a fairly simple alwayson effect and the Biyang does the job without costing a fortune But what makes it 5star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality Having a thumb miniscrew to open the 9V compartment instead of a plastic door or needing a Phillips screwdriver is a big deal Also love that the 9V jack is on the top of the unit away from the other jacks The pots are smooth and easy to turn and the miniswitches and footswitch are boutique level quality This is a great reverb pedal I dont think Ill ever need another one The best and one of the only quality budget reverbs,positive
Not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar Great stand,positive
No cable noise works well with pedals that dont play nice with other rightangle plugs like the original line of Aguilar pedals Great little product and I would buy them again Great cables,positive
After taking my guitar lessonsI never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars My instructor told me that I need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand and to see if I could pick out some melodys without too much problem I realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work and I have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes flexibilities and strengths Just go for the gusto and find what you like Colors of the rainbow can make your strumming and picking fingers really crank out a tune,positive
One was Dead on Arrival the other one works like a champ I like the old version more These are a little tricky to mount but do track well and are not obnoxious looking like the Snark tuners One was DOA Other works great,positive
Ive been playing guitar for 25 years and when I was first getting started for what ever reason I hated Super Slinkys with a passion I was a Fender or DAddario guy and EB SS were beneath meFast forward to a few weeks ago when I got a used Jackson with DEAD stings on it I wasnt sure I was going to keep it but wanted to give it a chance with new strings ALL of my guitars are setup with 10s but the Jackson needed 9s and I didnt want to bother setting up the Floyd Rose for 10s on a guitar I might not keepI came onto Amazon to find some inexpensive Prime eligible strings and these came up WTH Ill give them a shotWow these are some good sounding strings I have no idea why I didnt like them before maybe my hearing is much worse than before Who knows Anyway I ended up keeping the guitar a Jackson DK2M Gave them another shot,positive
Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water Luckily I keep that on hand Easy to install,positive
a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good exl 160s,positive
This was so perfect that we bought 2 more of them for our music at home Music stand,positive

These picks are fantastic but smaller then picks Ive used in the past but easy to hold onto due to the shape and texture very durable believe these are smaller for Jazz use Carbon Fiber Picks,positive
I bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a GLS mic and it doesnt fit either A little too small Too Small for some mics,negative
I revised a previous 4star review after playing with the Joyo British some more and especially after using it for direct linein recording I now rate it at 5 starsThe phrase Marshall in a box gets thrown around a lot but usually the people using it have a particular Marshall amp in mind For example the Wampler PlexiDrive sounds like an older Plexi while a MI Audio Crunch Box will do that 80s JCM compressed high gain tone On the recommendations of several people I picked up the Joyo British Sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different ampsDoes the British Sound succeed at that goal Yes and no On certain settings the British Sound does offer a convincing tubelike sound reminiscent of a Marshall cabinet You can clean it up quite a bit and it works very well as a foundation pedal placed last in your effects chain to give the amp Marshall character but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedalsNote The pedal is actually its own preamp so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp or into a PA system or mixer directly You can use it in the effects chain into another preamp but that will diminish its effectivenessBut despite those good traits theres just a few things off about it First it seems to add quite a bit more noise hiss than some of the other Joyo Sound pedals Or perhaps its just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a Marshall so i turned it up Second as several other reviewers noted the Voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be turning clockwise makes it sound thinner On the other three Joyo Sound pedals the opposite is true Functionally this really should mean nothing but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial inIf you read the manual for the Tech21 British upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned they claim that 900 on the VoiceCharacter knob would be JTMBluesbreaker territory 1200 would be Plexi and anything above that gives you the presence boost of a 70s Metalface I havent tried all those amps but perhaps its meant to brighten up as you turn it up and thats just a design choiceI think its possible to get the Marshall tone you want out of this thing but you have to work the EQ knobs with each adjustment of the Voice knob At this price hard to complain too much Not all of its sounds are great but theres plenty,positive
This is basically the Leatherman Multi tool for guitarist By Leatherman I really mean Planet Waves The go to sure shot company that will provide solid guitar products and accessories I buy cables picks straps from Planet Waves so I guess you could say Im a fan of their company And by multitool I really mean this Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter Everything you need to know is in the title It helps to wind your guitar strings the grip is comfortable and durable and once youve tuned your guitar you can clip off the excess guitar string Awesome But wait theres more I should be on an infomercial Theres also a nifty little pin puller for when you restring your acoustic instruments For the price this does everything and more I recommend if you need a winder just buy this Youll take out 3 birds with one stone even if you only needed to take out one bird if that makes sense Cheers Awesome,positive
I have a lot of guitar tuners in the house Ive had few handheld units some apps on my phone the Korg Pitch Black some Fender thing the Boss TU3 and the TC Electronic Polytune I can say that the only tuner that I prefer over this one is the Pitch Black This little CA1 is actually faster and better than the TU3 by a hair and absolutely kills the Polytune in speed and accuracy Korg really knows how to build their tuners and this one is a truly great one Works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric and also does a fine job on basses too I dont know if its accurate enough for a piano but it is what it is Amazingly useful little thing,positive
Works as advertised but the keys are stiff Pads take too much presure to activate Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptopAfter the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective productNot recommending this product OK for the price and USB connection without interface needed,negative
The best look and performance on a Fender guitar Ive used the Schaller Fender pinch top and found these to be the best performing easiest to use and best looking It does have a larger profile but I find it flattering to the fender guitar form Easy to install and have never failed me I like that there are three pins to ensure a proper grip rather than one pin holding in in a channel like the Schaller its clones Outside of security which I find greater with 3 pins it all boils down to personal preference when it comes to strap locks My favorite strap lock,positive
This was my first acoustic guitar and Ive received some surprised looks about its tone and playability both from from my luthier who used to be a tech at Martin to a couple pro players with 3040 years respectively under their belts Its light comfortable well made has a fast neck and is just marvelous in every way for a beginner like myself Wonderfully priced I was expecting to be disappointed but didnt want to invest in a new hobby until I was sure Id stick with itIts possible that I just lucked out with a good one After a year of playing my Jasmine I have no urge to upgrade to anything else Will confess that Id like a 12string but thats another animalI am too new and inexperienced with acoustics to be able to really define the sonic quality of this guitar compared to more expensive models Im more of an electric guy but for me in my ignorant state its 5 stars without hesitationI did need to have it set up however and the stock strings on mine were in poor condition Dont recall if I purchased it on Amazon In any event a 3050 trip to the luthier with new strings and it felt like a guitar far in excess of 100 It has stayed in tune quite nicely and I often change tunings standard mostly Eb occasional full step down Open D G and othersNo fret buzz and I just love the feel of the neck I do wish the body was a tad thinner as I have shoulder problems but Im sure a thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass and richness Nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your backBy the way I have the model with the black pickguard the one pictured looks similar in every other way Quite sure its the same model Wonderful acoustic at a price thats hard to beat,positive
I bought this because I had already bought a 1 spot plug but as i gained pedals I needed something to power them without buying more adapters and this is greatest way to solve that problem Highly recommended Great daisy chain,positive
For the price its worth it I guess If you just want to try it go for it thats what I got it for It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal But for the price its not too badOh and the casing isnt like a wimpy plastic knife plastic its pretty durable Albeit dont throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps Hair metal clean tones hue,positive
Its just about deadon with my Korg which is extremely accurate I had never seen a tuner that you can just clip onto the neck like this and it is hugely convenient to have it sitting right there as you play Its soft enough with the clip that it is safe to have on a high end guitar without worrying about it scratching or hurting anything It shuts itself off when you forget to do that which happens a lot Good little tuner at a steal of a price I like it Works nice,positive
Now that the SN13 is about the same price as an SN8 Ive changed the comment about the price differentialThe SN13 is another great Snark chromatic tuner with a Super Tight display However the black SN8 adds a tap tempo metronome and the ability to set the tuner a few semitones below standard for about the same price No matter for me since all I use is the tuner anyway Still the SN13 is white and for all I know may do a better job at tuning an older iPad Great tuner but NOT a white SN8,positive
My wife was worried about what to get me for Christmas I really didnt want anything other than the Harley I have been asking for for 25 years maybe next and while surfing Amazon I came across this Les Paul I had to laugh since it looks so much like my Gibson Les Paul kind of like a Mini Me versionWell I have never heard of a Les Paul Uke and did not think for 99 that it would be muchbut the reviews were telling a different story So I found my Christmas present at last for the man who has everything it is true my wife told mestill hoping for that Harley though I ordered it a few days before Christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wifes dismaybut I printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway Well Christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing the Uke not the Harley but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when I opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby Les PaulI figured since I was taking my fellow Amazonians word I better order some Aquila Ukulele Strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the Uke are junkand they are shame of Epiphone which I did the Uke arrived about 4 days before the strings but I attempted to learn how to play it anywayOUCH those stock strings were rough on the fingers and the sound left much to be desired so I waited until the new string were installed prior to this reviewWow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers I just love it nowSo if you decide to get one of these Mini Me Les Pauls do yourself a favor and getA set if Aqila stringsAquila USA Aquila Concert Ukulele StringsA Snark Uke Tuner SN6Snark SN6 Ukulele TunerA nice leather guitar strapFender Plain Leather Guitar Strap With Fender Logo BlackandA Daily Ukulele Song Book by Jumpin JimThe Daily Ukulele 365 Songs for Better Living DAILY UKULELE PaperbackYou will love all of these items I am sureWhen it arrives be sure to practice Billie Jean played by Jim Hillsee it on YouTubeit is a riotorJake Shimabukuro Bohemian RhapsodyEnjoy WOW A Les Paul Mini MeDont let the small price fool you,positive
This is the best thing I have done to my Telecaster I had some noise even at moderate volumes After shielding it is absolutely quiet This peel and stick tape has conductive glue so you dont have to solder the overlap joints I overlapped about 1434 and had a 3 1234 X 834 piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity The tape is petty easy to use sticks well inside the cavities and is strong I didnt break or tear any pieces I will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build There is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups Excellent Product,positive
Being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the Snark SN 1 I purchased this bargain priced tuner I could not be more pleased It has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele Not only does it have tone dial indicator but the screen changes color red for flat green for just right yellow for sharp The screen is also very bright and easy to read It is very sensitive no need to constantly move it around like with the Snark SN 1 It is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse I use mine for when I go to the music store and test out ukuleles This makes a perfect main tuner or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners My main tuner is a Snark SN 8 but this one is just as accurate The only negatives I can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate so you dont want to force it and the power button is very tiny but for the size and performance of the unit those low points are almost irrelevant Buy a couple you can get two or three of these for the price of a single Snark or Korg Excellent little tuner,positive
The C has the same numbered base plate top and bottom so the numbers are totally opposite on each side I see what people mean about the taste but thats hardly a problem as I knew what I was purchasing Overall reasonably satisfied will give them a good try later QC must have been asleep the day they made these,neutral

This Joyo JF34 US dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion effect My son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques This box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effectsThe box is very good quality with nice large controls and metal foot switch The unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source not includedThis is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar playersHighly RecommendedCFHNote Manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments Cool Distortion Effects Highly Recommended,positive

I just got this and Ive noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone I have a crybaby that doesnt have the range the 847 does but its 10xs more transparent There may be other factors at play here as it is new but the lesson is try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you tone issues,negative

Rugged good looking efficientsorta like me Have several tuners of different names and quality But this Seiko is certainly the quickest The rubber housing is an excellent idea Would buy another Seiko Tuner,positive
This was my first guitar Ive had it for about 5 or 6 years now My wife bought it at a local center from the recommendation of one of the teachers I taught myself to play on this First the good This instrument is a good beginner piece It has a nice full sound and does not take steel fingers to make acceptable sounds The tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great The fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price It looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas The frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good Tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well Often only a tweak or 2 before a practice session is all that is needed I have never had it go out of tune while playing even when stringbending As you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine It is amazingly playable From simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all The only real compliant I had and the reason for the 4 stars is the stock strings arent the best IMHO for a beginner Im pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound and WONT break they are BRUTAL on new fingers I would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on The only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings All in all this is a great deal for the beginner or even advanced players that just want an extra guitar around to jam on when they dont feel like dragging out the expensive units like playing around a campfire or outdoors If your a beginner just starting out this is a great route to go as the guitar will continue to give great sounds as you advance great starter that grows with you,positive
Ive had my eye on a G7th capo for awhile but this became available in the Vine program so I decided to try itThe capo was easy to pop out of the package The design is simple and easy to understand and use It is very lightweight and works fine on my Epiphone electric guitar The capo also has a handy builtin pick holderThis capo certainly meets my needs and Ive removed the G7th from my wish list Easy To Use,positive
Well thats overstating it a little but several people told me I wouldnt like FW strings on my bass I wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound smoother and more mellow I considered RWs to be way too bright on my guitar So I put these on my 1978 MusicMan StingRay bass I only have a little Peavey practice amp which may account for how bright these still sound But I love them I have to dial the active EQ treble control all the way down this is just a brightsounding bass But I wanted more of a standup doghouse bass sound like early basses had I have a lowlevel Hofner violin bass also with FWs on it it shipped with RWswhat were they thinking but I loves me my MusicMan And I love the sound of these strings Oddly a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut but it doesnt seem to affect the sound As soon as I get a REAL amp I expect these to completely satisfy And they WILL pop but then again this is an awesome bass made during Leos time with MM But if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good Lack of a good amp and not knowing how long theyll last is why I gave them 4 stars Otherwise 5 star all the way They said I was mad MAD I tell you,positive

Like the name implies some very cool sounding 70s distortions not overbearing so your pickups and amp tone still stay in their I like the mod switch in the top left corner sounds good with my compressor infront MXR so ez to use and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and to last A very FUN pedal for some retro distortion,positive

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT The MXR Fullbore Metal is a highoctane distortion suitable for modern metal music Its 3band EQ with adjustable Midrange Q gives the MXR FM the ability to model virtually every other distortion out thereWHAT I LIKE about the pedal is that its small easy to operate and doesnt take much time to dial in the tone you want I play with a Marshall JCM2000 DSL50 going into a 1960A 4x12 using a Les Paul Standard and it sounds amazing I love the onboard Marshall JCMflavored tube distortion but it is more in line with the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal obviously and not entirely suitable for modern American metalcore The MXR Fullbore Metal gets me to where I need to go This is nice because I can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel and then tap the Fullbore when I need to play metalWHAT I DISLIKE is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise so you have to be careful with the Treble and MidQ knobs However I also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amps EQ settings as well so know in advance youll need to spend a good 15minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposesWHAT ABOUT THE EH METAL MUFF I owned a Metal Muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away The big 34selling point34 about the MM is that it has a Top Boost Big deal I wrote a review for the MM on Amazon but in summary the Top Boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical Comparing the Top Boost to the Noise Gate in terms of the big 34selling point34 the Fullbores Noise Gate which has adjustable sensitivity to me seems like a MUCH better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to soundWHAT ABOUT THE BOSS ME70 I currently own an ME70 and being totally honest I think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarists give each other about multieffects is because in their mind they think an oldfashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is 34real34 whereas multieffects pedals are 34fake34 This might be true to some extent but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains that at some point the tradeoff does indeed make sense FYI Dave Mustaine uses a DigiTech GSP1101 as part of his live rig endrant Anyway the Boss ME70 has only a few settings useful onstage but not so much for recording since in the end they do sound a tad digital and the ME70 compresses your signal The MXR Fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it winsFOR RECORDING PURPOSES I bought this pedal because I wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my Metal EP Im selfrecording In conjunction with an ADA GCS3 I created an allanalog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing Check out the ADA GCS3 if you can Its an amazing speaker simulator and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was its own 1x12 combo amplifier Anyway through the GCS3 the Fullbore basically sounds like a MesaBoogieWHY ONLY 4 STARS The Fullbore isnt for everybody it isnt for every guitar or every amp but by itself its really friggin good I suppose if it had a 10band EQ and a 12AX7 preamp circuit it would be 34the best metal pedal34 but for a small piece of gear its probably the best analog distortion on the market American Distortion,positive

I picked these up on impulse 8211 they were on a good sale and I was dissatisfied with my older cheaper set of Panasonic overtheears Im glad I did 8211 these are excellent headphones and theyve exceeded my expectations on just about every level The sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise They feel extremely sturdy and wellmade from the cans themselves to the nice thick coiled cord although a removable cord would be a nice bonus Finally and this is important theyre incredibly comfortable As a video editor I often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time The cans rotate on two axis so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and wellpadded They grip your head snugly without that horrible 34vice grip34 feelingIve heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under 200 I havent tried enough pairs to make that judgement but I will say that I highly recommend them Its one of the best purchases Ive made in a long time Fantastic headphones,positive
I was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of Afganistan I was going to get the Martin Backpacker which I have actually seen and held in a store but other reviews sold me on this Washburn The case was a particular positive point for me and so was the 25 lower price I am more than please with what I have received The case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets The Guitar itself is very well made nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument It does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body common to the type as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body and you cant exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic The thing is this guitar is just plain fun it is always handy durable and plays pretty well Best buy I have made on a product I couldnt try out first A testament to the quality of the reviews on Amazon which have rarely led me astray Great little Guitar bought based on reviews,positive

I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long McQuade located in Canada Its the same as the one Amazon is selling here I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele My reason for buying this is because I dont have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have yeaIt is very similar to a guitar in many important ways It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way However and this is VERY important so please read carefully To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch For example lets take the 6th string lowest and tune it up to A instead of E Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads A It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitarSo heres the breakdown on tuning each string6th A5th D4th G3rd C2nd E1st AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you wont get that beautiful ukulele voice The action is very good and it will not be any harder to playThe instrument overall is fairly easy to play especially in the lower positions I have trouble holding it because Im used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff Also I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others arent so good Almost all Celtic music sounds great Christmas carols are lovely but Spanish stuff doesnt sound so great imho The instrument just doesnt have enough power to carry some types of music Blues are good and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele It seems to be well constructed the tuning gears work well the action is good frets are inserted straight and level so I really cant find anything to complain about especially for the priceI would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun Its just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but thats not absolutely necessary especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instrumentsI took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings something Ive always wanted to do Im quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them DUPDATE 41013I bought another guitarlele this time from Amazon and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it Weve been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do Classical Guitar Instructors Review LOVE IT,positive

I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends They didnt care at all for nanowebs which are widely available but swore by the quality of the polywebs By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake I requested a return to get the proper item and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble I havent had a chance to test either set of strings out but Im sure theyll be greatIts my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy with some proper care Ive been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings they dont measure up to the polywebs A minor mishap averted thanks to the kind seller,positive

Always buy DAddario strings for my 7 guitars Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types They have a great rating from other musicians and the price is very affordable Highly recommended by this writer It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar stringsit is a bit like discussing our likes in food musicians moviesetc We all have our likes and dislikesFor my taste DAddario EJ163D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings I like their full sound and their lasting tones DAddario Strings Are My Favourites,positive

I acquired this recently I did not need another strat style or copy of but its whitejust gotta love that vibe Anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good heres a few add ons in case Its routed hsh under the hood but looks tight Think its bucker size upgradable top and bottom didnt measure I like single coilsthe white is a poly finish love poly durable and crackfade resist and exquisite nicely done alder body but its hefty alder like 8lb or so Not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice too nice to change like I was thinking till I got it Nice quality control on these really smooth rosewood board with medjumbo thats what I call anyway frets good fretting Standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed no missed screw holes etc Was set up with standard action etc out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc great fit and finish best I can tell its a standard f type plate if interested looks to be easy changerOverall its a solid piece assembled well for me the body and neck is what seals the deal better then most out there this range It is alder and hefty but durable I look to change most hardware in time so wont comment on that whats there is installed well2 things I forgot tuners wanna say 151 10mm standard import style Seem good not legendary and tremelowhammy standard zinc block theres the must upgrade part its standard 105 string space import I got one pet peave its steel or brass blocks A shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe 50 best money ever spent I cant afford the gotoh or Callahan stuff On this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder youll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better Also the neck I say nice but I mean its nicer than most in the shape its slightly chunky c shape Not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 13 its beefier I have avg size hands I find its a good fitIn all If your looking in this price range its nice and upgradable as you can or learn more Have a lot to compare it to,positive
The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitars surface the strap is actually connected What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitars weight The 34fulcrum34 is the surface of the wood if this makes sense and I cant help but wonder if it could eventually eventually over much time and use cause cracks or splits as a resultI found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap unless youre going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders and no additional stress on the guitars body Ive ordered a set So far so good but may have found something much better,neutral
Theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves The heavy bottons 32 42 and 52 adds a BOOM in the tone The others 10 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also I dont rate it 5 stars for the lack of VCI When i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection The high strings were plenty of flakes If fender solved that it would be perfect Its almost perfect,positive
This is my second set of these I bought the 1st set in the 1980s and Im still using them on the guitar that they matched black hardware I was impressed with the quality of the 1st set and the 2nd set is just as good Money well spent schaller locks,positive
It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better1 It slips off if you go too fast but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this2 It didnt come with much of any instructions so I was using it wrong at first There is a big and a small slot3 The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use The cutter works great you just have to be careful4 The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose Sure I can tighten it but it just means the design could be betterAll and all its one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master I hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesnt scratch the chrome off my turner pegs That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose And well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find Everything I have seems to be jet black Handy Little Gadget,positive

I recently purchased this ukulele from a local Guitar Center When i first got there i was looking at the Lanikai brand but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that I felt like a strong wind could tear it apart Then I saw this one It has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range I have already learned the basic chords and cant wait to become proficient with this instrument Great First Ukulele,positive

This arm hold the weight of a ATR2100 microphone fine It stays where you put it and it works as you would expect The packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works The shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts I did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me However it works great Not too big and gets the job doneTip just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit My ATR2100 is a 2 inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around 3 inches I just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great Great for the price,positive

After getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings I finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too I didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great It also has a pin puller which I havent tried yet but Im sure its great as well This would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician or if you just want a great all in one tool But this thing All you need,positive
I doubt you can beat this for 25 The uke is a solid little guy I shimmed the bridge a little because I can play hard but it wasnt bad Pretty well in tune up the neck Strings are ok but I do have some Aquilas to put on will see if it matters muchThe tuners ARE geared not friction like in the one picture at least mine areThe carrying bag is just that with no padding or other protection but keeps the rain off Good deal for the price,positive
Once you setup your pedalboard thats it you arent going to move stretch or step on these cablesso the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue They do however allow you to make the most use of the space on yourpedalboard packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require GET MORE PEDALS ON YOUR BOARD,positive
Ive been playing for nearly ten years and Ive used all sorts of strings on many different guitars Ive had ball ends pop off for no reason ball ends rolling around in the bottoms of containers when Ive bought them new and a lot of unnecessary string breakage and fast corrosion all top brands I have also overpaid for fancy gimmicks on strings that are supposed give you magic tones ect Then I tried Daddario they just work and work well Im not asking for anything magical I just need what I need when I need it and these string have never failed to deliver Ive been using them for over three years now I dont know why I didnt give them a shot sooner I could have saved a lot of money trying them first Bottom line is these strings do the job without any drama giving me more time to just play DAddario Ive finally found my strings,positive
Ive owned several multieffect pedals in the past even one Digitech Up til now they all had one thing in common layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments It was a pain Then I saw this onewith KNOBS I did a lot of research and was torn between the RP255 and the RP355 I decided to go cheap and got the RP255 So far that was an OK decision The RP255 has plenty of features and is a good compromise between menus and knobs I recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientationTo sum up the device quickly the RP255 is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want but you may need to work at it As with many multieffect pedals there is a selection of 60 factory toneeffect profiles to save you the trouble of programming new ones These are mirrored by 60 userdefined profiles which are identical to the factory presets The difference is that 160 can be modified by the user or left asis The factory presets 61120 are not modifiable So you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory You can also reset the entire device if you want to but if you do you will lose all of your modificationsIn addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer there are also two additional features which are very useful a pretty basicdrum machine and a 20 second looper The looper is really why I bought this pedal Its easy to use and it overdubs I only wish Digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper 20 seconds really isnt much FYI you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time No biggie for meOK all thats good so why am I disappointed in this unit Pretty simple Im an older guy who has been playing for approximately 50 years Ive played every kind of music there is and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets This may be a slight exageration but it seems like 95 of the presets are some sort of obnoxious distortion Come on guys not all of your customers are 13 years old I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices Now Im faced with working out all of my own presets Im back to programming menus again ughSo thats about it Its a solid piece of equipment with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from In all honesty if I had been aware of this I would have probably not gotten this unit inspite of its good design and quality Disappointed,neutral
The strap is of good quality and since its new it still feel stiff but I am happy that I got it Stiff but good quality,positive
This baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price One does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesnt know which in or output is actually making the interference but once youve established that its all good baby WORKS LIKE A CHARM,positive
I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion sweat fingerprints dust what have you I take some of this spray it on a cloth give it some elbow grease and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back It has a fresh lemon scent I recommend this to everyone a lot of product for an affordable price Perfect Clean,positive
Im a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices I play guitar mandolin and ukelele And this inexpensive tuner is the best one Ive ever used by a long way Ive paid a lot more for a lot less It has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone The dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles And it has the fastest and best response of any tuner Ive ever used It doesnt require a loud volume to hear the tone Finally it doesnt seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone If I detune by about 116th of a turn on my tuning machine an difference I cant hear with my own ear this device detects it immediately All in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning A Newer Tuner,positive
This is a good durable mount I like the look of it as well as the lightweight feel Not much else to be said Good Durable,positive
I cant play real guitars but i did buy this for Rock Band This is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way This has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it I even use it when im drumming I highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players Well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has Oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried Good and Solid,positive
Im pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years I havent found a wireless unit that I feel comfortable with on stage yet I was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until I purchased these At first I purchased one just to check them out but after six months I decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these There just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too They last forever Definitely worth the money A very well made cable for working musicians,positive
Ive owned two of these pedals and they both had the same quirk The delay is amazing the repeats trail and decay beautifullyThe controls give you a wide range of tonesBut Theyve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me One constant high pitched screeching toneMy signal chain was low gain And its done it when it was the only pedal In the chain so Its not another pedals Influence I love the sound but I wont use it live in case of feedbackThat being said its still a very good pedal Good effect one problem,positive
I use these strings for my Telecasters and I have to say the tone is wonderful beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use Very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar Tone,positive
I have a lovehate relationship with compressors For 4000 you cant go wrong with this one I use it a lot on my practice rig If you need a top notch compressor hands down the Keeley 4 knob I use a Keeley in my live shows Expensive but worth it As for this Joyo I cant complain It does its job pretty good but it does color your tone some what True bypass is nice its noticeable in your chain but not to much to take it out I love for my practice rig Good buy if youre on a budget all us musicians are just dont expect to blown away by it For 40 give it a shot I did and dont regret it Pretty good but not great,positive
doesnt last as long or sound as bright as Elixirs but these are half the price Good bargain though for 699sounds all right to me bright and well balanced soundMy little brother cant tell the difference since hes new but it works well on his guitar Works well,positive

I needed a single button switch for my little Mustang I that I practice on Ive never owned the Fender model switch but I know what it is It will do the job but its lightweight and wont sit flat on the floor if the cord isnt laying exactly right I searched a little further and ran across this switch on Amazon by scrolling down a bit Marshall Footswitch One Button With LED by AmplifiedParts Folks this thing is built like a tank The casing is made of heavy duty I dont know what gauge solid steel Theres nothing rinky dink about it I plugged it in to the FTSW jack clicked the button the LED lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset Again light went out and back to the original It felt solid under my foot and I dont think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb sledge hammer I dont know how well the electronics will hold up I just got it today but the switch again feels solid like its supposed to It cost me 2090 with shipping It takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what were use to with Amazon but it ships directly from AmplifiedParts I believe Im a Fender fan but this beats their single switch Thanks for reading guys Lane H Better Switch,positive
Ive had this for nearly a year and I have no complaints Works perfectly Sounds awesome Lots of gain tons more than my Boss SD1 wthe Monte Allums SD808 mod If lost or stolen Id buy another Highly recommended Great overdrive,positive
Compared to the SnarkSnark SN1 Tunertuners I really like the low profile leave it on the instrument design of this tuner The Snark goose neck is easily broken and hard to keep safe in a gig bag This works much better in that regard This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine Tuning accuracy Hard to say it just indicates high low on pitch really I prefer the more precise and wider scale 1 readout of the Snark They are much more precise nearly good enough to intonate an instrument But this is probably good enough for most just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gigThe negatives and why I cant recommend it are as follows The battery cover on mine fits very loosely I worry the battery will fall out very easily I may end up gluing it in place It isnt immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it and theres no indicator which way the battery goes in is up I think The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user thats right sideways On a bass I dont really need it to tell me which string Im plucking or tuning but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it It wouldnt be so hard to read either if the letters werent so highly stylized but then turn it on its side and it is just unreadable for me anyhow I just cant for the life of me work out why they designed it this way I like the low profile design but a it has several problems,negative
Very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it I would recommend this product to a friend Cherub WCP60G Acoustic Guitar Pickup,positive
Great highs and lows but rough on the fingertips and difficult doing barre chords slides and single string progressions OK with more effort Hard on the fingertips,neutral

Tascam had the first inexpensive multitrack recorder on the market and even as competitors entered the market theyve managed to stay on top Ive owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use I had a Boss Micro BR80 for a while but I found the allmenu interface annoying and difficult to use I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks record and mix down and ended up having to repeat things over and over I soon sold it and then replaced it with a Tascam DP004 when that appeared on the market The Tascam wasnt really any more powerful than the Boss and lacked the built in rhythm tracks but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassettebased recorderAfter the DP004 Tascam produced a followon six track unit and this recorder the 8track DP008 When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit There were plenty of 8track recorders out there but none that were that small and that inexpensive Its also more than just a DP008 with more tracks The DP008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ compression and effects individually on tracks for the mix down while leaving the original tracks unaffected Like the DP004 it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording Unlike the DP004 it comes with an external power supply in the box a 24 option with the original 004 and can use an external battery packIve been playing with my 008 all weekend doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings One thing I noticed right off was that theres a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings but the noise isnt there in the finished playback I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004 the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual As mentioned previously theres an awful lot of capability there and its going to take some time to be able to use it effectively Most of that functionality is menubased rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel and I have to say thats one thing I dont really care for The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel thats not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpadMost of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms At home I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USBequipped Alesis console for input Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and for ultimate portability iPod Touch All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP008 and much more powerful Of course theyre also a lot more expensive and lack the builtin stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface Having XLR connectors as well as 14 inputs is a really nice touch something you never saw on portables from a few years ago I like the oldschool approach of the DP008 as well as the allinone package approachIf I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and didnt have a lot to spend I think the DP008 might be a good choice Its really good enough to produce music for a bands first CD releases and costs less than a decent microphone WIth 8 full tracks theres no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down and if you really need to you can bounce and add a further six tracks giving you 14 in all I dont think its going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality Garage Band gives me a full orchestra keyboards and drums as well but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year Most powerful of the ultraportable multitracks,positive
I have finally learned my lessonI have purchased a number of these over the last year or two and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say good for static applications as the cable conductors are prone to breakage even along the length of the cable not just at the connectorsBut they are dirt cheap so i figured that was okBut now after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to workA week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain yupthe cableSo by all means buy these on price but when you get your itemsplease fully check them out a simple does it work yesno is clearly not good enough as i learned no longer any confidence in this brand,negative
This pedal really hits the spotWarm vintage analog slapback delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate which if you are a fan of Johnny Greenwood you will love I also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound with the modulation on and very short delay time sounds almost like a phaser A classic slapback vintage delay,positive

I read the reviews with low stars the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head We use it to hold the musics and dont need to turn the head The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too if they turned they could not fit into the music stand rack This one work great for usWe have several music stands we didnt like them not because the heads cant be turned but they are unstable and cant hold thick book Very sturdy and heavy duty,positive
These things grab the mic and wont let go They are worth the extra cost Buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping Great Worth It,positive
An old school delay that works very well Simple to use Adjustments for intensity and length Uses 9V batt or power adaptor Reasonably priced Analoge Delay works great,positive
One of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps is a great analog delay for under 17500 Using bucket brigade circuitry true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit Utilizing the modulation switch you can achieve a slight chorusing sound like the flutter from old tape echoes which can be adjusted via the internal trim potThe unit has a small footprint like most MXR pedals so it is very pedal board friendlyThis is truly a great sounding delay so try one out Great echoechoecho,positive
Ive been very happy with all of my Joyo pedals Ive gotten but I really love this one I use it with a crate amp with a tube preamp on the clean channel with my strat and it sounds great I really like this pedal,positive
These are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine Ive always been a huge fan of Jim Dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come The guitar will not fall,positive
This tuner clips on easily to all the instruments I have shows pitch quickly and accurately The screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time It actually just dims the display as the battery is dying and can last like that for months Ive banged mine around a bit and its stayed in one piece The plastic is solid but not unbreakable The size of the tuner is a bit large its not the smallest on the market but it is small and light enough that when I leave it on my ukes headstock I cant feel the extra weight Easy to operate easy to read I like it so much I got another one right away when I thought Id lost the first Now I have two and am considering getting a third to keep in the travel bag Wonderful tuner,positive
This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4 Its always on it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted There are only two knobs I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound I do a lot of recording I also checked the sound after recording Cant reccomend it enough especially considering the price Great pedal at the end of your FX chain,positive
This shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle No adjustment is required once it is set for the instruments size 34 or 44 arrived set for 44 It simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place Good value for the price Easy to use,positive
I have too many guitars and dont play them all so instead of buying an extra case or stand I figured I could use some wall decoration This works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws Definitely recommend Very Convenient and Nice looking,positive
Worked perfectly for my needs I dont have a ton of pedals and just needed a few patch cables to connect them all When it comes to quality of cables Im really not to picky about it I know theres a bunch of gear snobs that turn their noses at anything they consider 34inferior34 in quality which usually from my observation has to do with cheap affordable prices equaling bad quality and higher end merchandise is always super expensive If you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine Just what I needed,positive
Item shipped earlier than Ive expected When I opened the box was surprised as I didnt notice the usb cable But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it wasI have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds It is working fine Though it has no motorized faders it doesnt make my work uncomfortable at all I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and its just working perfectI recommend it to home studios also those who travel with recording gear Nano is small but quite durableI am happy with it exelent,positive
I was looking for something like this for a long time if you are like me that likes the analogical pedals this is a good option grat product,positive

I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs I just miss the mecanical click of a mechanic metronome The rest is just great ive bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better Good tuner and metronome,neutral
These are great strings and were my favorite until I found Fender Pure Nickel strings Some may like the sound of these some may like the Pure Nickel Made in the USA,positive
Cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired At least its long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures This should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra lengthI am comparing it to 10 guitar center straps which have double leather ends which are much sturdier than the ones on this Ernie Ball strap which are thin and single ply I wouldnt trust this strap without a strap lock cheap,neutral
If an initially unfavorable opinion changes I owe it to the maker to say so so Im saying soFor me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be usedIts not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down In many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers So a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involvedAs far as the SN8 is concernedWRONGIve found the SN8 to in fact be Super Tight BUT one has to insure that there isnt even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green barThis is what I dont like about the other type of Snark display Its not symmetric It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit If the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat When Im on pitch I want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanishIn that regard the image shown here is wrong It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow UhmnoThe SN8 is Super Tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semitones if thats what floats your boat and as they say on TV All for an incredibly low priceI keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case At this price I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way Eating crow its a fine tuner,positive
I have this hooked up to 4 Pedals so far and its awesome Real cost saver on batteries You really cant go wrong for the price Great Accessory,positive

i use this cable to patch my effects pedals together and it does what it needs to do the right angle ends make it easy to connect your pedals and keep them close together good patch cable,positive
Installs with two screws I dont trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws I drilled into wooden studs It is firm secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla These seem very well made The prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument Some of the foam padding used in hangers and stands may cause a reaction with nitro cellulose finishes so I will keep my eye on it for a while Over all it is a good way to display your instruments it allows easy access and unclutters the floor in my very small music room I bought 4 and going back for more Wall Mount Insturment HangerDynomite and reasonable priced,positive
Replaced the stock tubes Groove Tubes in my Blues Junior with a matched pair of JJs Much better tone IMHO The sound is exactly what you want in an EL84 and the tubes have held up very well I am coming up on needing a complete retube of my Palomino V32 and I will also be using JJs Warm reliable EL84 goodness,positive
this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm pretty decent price compared to GC as well seems to be of good quality,positive
This cable is very well constructed I use it in my DJ business and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it This is simply a great cable,positive
Easy to hold onto Im a big fan of the Dunlop picks and these are great for playing live because you simply wont drop them The max grip works,positive
This is heavy but strong Very comfortable I cannot carry it around with me but it works well at home I recommend it Great Heavy Duty Foot Rest,positive
every single guitarist thats plays live or even just practices standing up at home has that worry 34is my guitar gonna cut lose for my strap and fall down to the floor34 well there little fellows are a solution they work just fine and i think they are reliable wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger but i mean good price no need to change the guitars built in strap buttons 100 recommended also i read a review bout it not fitting some guys lp well obviously that depends on the strap but it use these strap locks on my lp standard 1959 vos and they fit just fine use it with a gibson asfbblk strap very very good,positive
I was very disappointed when I tried this thing I bought it so that I could play along the songs that I have on my Ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted dont thing I havent tried changing the settings on the effectsamps Also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables If you want to record what you play youre probably better off saving some money and buying the Boss recorder or something like that Being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it it sounds so horrible is unbearableUpdate July 8 2012 Against my better judgement I brought the Slash Amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better I guess the tittle of this review stands the free app sucks but if you pay for it itll be actually useful I added two stars to the product you get what you pay for,neutral
Love the very fast tracking So convienient to have a cheap but amazing tuner on each of my guitars For 10 bux each why not The screen articulates so there is always a perfect view I am finding myself making much more minor adjustments to my tuning than I used to just because its right there and so convienient so my playing sounds better than ever before simply because I am always in perfect tune now Way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet finding a expensive 9 volt battery selecting a note you want to tune and waiting for a needle to stop moving on my crappy old tuner Just an amazing product I even clipped it onto my piano and bought a 30 set of tools online and saved 100 tuning my piano myself Great deal for the money life is too short to be out of tune,positive
If you need a well made cable in a short length I wouldnt hesitate to recommend these Buy one now Quality cable,positive
Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice GOOD PRODUCT,positive
does a good job for a basic delaygood for rockabilly and 50s slap echo I needed it for nothing else so Im happy ModTone Guitar Effects Mini Mod Series MTMDLY,positive
I have tons of picks and these are well made and easy for me to hold in my hand without slipping around too much Easy to grip and use,positive
This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at 40 The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube ampDifferent distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom endThe guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite toneI may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass The classic Boss distortion pedal for 40,positive
I already liked the Jazz 3 picks by Dunlop these made from the Ultex material sound so much better and the surface of the pick is niceeven with sweaty fingersthey stay put I do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick Sweet These are clear yellow picks I would love to see them in red that would be brutal NIfty little picks,positive
If youre a metalhead STAY AWAY I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion Its GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch But if you demand metal get far away CRAP,negative
I have ordered several of these like 6 or 7 I love them They are great for holding picks make wonderful gifts I have ordered several of these like 6 or 7,positive
I usually use the Pro Steels by DAddario but these sound and fit nicely with my Squire Fender P Bass Amazon seems to have great prices and its nice to have them delivered too Great Pratice and Live Strings,positive
I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made it sounds really really good The capo is very easy to use as well Great product I love the capo they made,positive
For a long time I never thought much about guitar strings I pretty much thought they were all the sameIn fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days DAddario has gotten into the act with these NYXL strings and I have to say that they are not like any other strings Ive usedThe feel is different and the sound is different Different in a WOW way Yeah theyre more expensive but theyre worth it Im a cheapskate and I cant go back to cheap stringsNow Im spoiled and Ive become a guitar strings snob Cadillac of Guitar Strings,positive
This thing works great and it looks very stylish with the guitar hanging on the wall This also keeps it away from the kids who always seem to want to play it Very good idea and holds it perfectly Works great,positive
I was unaware when I originally purchased these that there was a threaded mic mount on the back extension pole I already had a couple 13 posilok boom arms that I popped on them and was able to reclaim two floor mic stands and save a little bit more floor space They are fairly well constructed for the price and fit perfectly in my small home studio The mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore Great price and a real space saver,positive
I placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer Stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock Ping tuners This is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed To those who say it doesnt stay in tune should have their guitars bridge checked as flaws in the bridge can cause problems in tuning stays in tune,positive
I usually use 9s but decided to try these 10s instead I didnt notice much of a difference at first but after a while I noticed that its easier to tune between the G and D string 3rd and 4th strings because the gauges are closer Sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that Fatal Blow Helps me deliver a Fatal Blow,positive
I only needed one I havent use it but Im sure its going to work well This is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on topffsalsa Great stand I use it for a small amp that I purchase for a piano player it holds well,positive
One of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers Well after starting to use it on Windows 7 x64 I was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings I went to the Behringer website I found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days Needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use Windows 7 I am using this with a Behringer 1202FX mixer it is a good combo The build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough I treat my gear with care I figure itll probably last for years and years and years I am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation Awesome once you figure it out,positive
We bought this rack tray for our sons new sound rack It is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet It is a short shelf so it only goes about halfway to the back of the rack cabinet He uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet Inexpensive Rack Tray,positive
I have limited experience with these types of product but it does get finger grime off quite well and does not leave streaks like another guitarbrand name product I also have Would buy again,positive
This is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming I Love the added level of control the grip surface gives me Great Pick,positive
Excellent guitar picks of medium hardness Picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly If you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more Guitar Picks,positive
Quite resistant and reliableGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Thank you very much Good,positive
Zero issues with this cable so far It feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in unplugging and packing between practice spacesIll update this review ifwhen it breaks Pretty cheap cable that has lasted so far,positive
I use these light guage strings because I have arthritis Makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again And if you buy them in a 10 pack you save a bunch of money Best strings made,positive
I recently purchased this recorder and have compared it to my older MAudio Microtrak II The Tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement The internal mics are adjustable the interface is easy to use the battery life is long and the batteries are common AA and easy to replace on locationIve not tested the external xlr mic preamps but have recorded with the internal mics with absolutely wonder results The internal preamp is very quiet the mics on acoustic grand piano are very dynamic produce excellent detail and have what appears to be a very wide neutral frequency response The recorder produces a very wide and deep soundstage and does outclass my older recorder in every aspect To me the price is very reasonable and the build quality is reasonable for the price Highly recommended Excellent recorder,positive
It works well for holding up a guitar and it looks good doing it As long as you dont ask it to hold up a bass youll be fine the price is hard to beat too Fine Strap,positive
Ive had this for about 2 weeks now and this capo is simple and works great It feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well If you know how much pressure to apply to the frets the capo works great though I always have to do a bit of fine tuning as was expected in the first place I love how cheap it was compared to the other capos and yes its not made of plastic Works as good as any other capo for a lower price,positive
Compared these all in Medium 013s on a Taylor 210 dreadnought Martin SP Bronze Phosphor Bronze Martins Lifespan SP Dr Daddario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze and Elixir Nanoweb 8020 Bronze and Phospher Bronze I tried them back to back Switching back and forth Narrowing it down to Daddario and Elixirs I did the same with these 3 sets One day Id try all 3 playing along with a cd Then Id try a different set every 3 days The Elixir 8020 comes out on top Best sounding of all smooth on my fingers Second Elixir Phospher bronze last was Daddario Id be satisfied with the Daddario they do sound good But the Elixir sounds feels better Best sounding strings,positive
I recived this guitar today2813and its perfect After I tuned it it sounded greatit plays welland it does not hurt my fingers like my old guitar This guitar is amazing Best acoustic guitar i have had,positive
fist off guitar center had this for 29 bucks I KNOW RIGHT It was in front of the tag for this 30 bucks and the sp1 for 1499 so I got it but it was in the wrong spot I went got the price tag and after minimal drama they gave it to me for the price they had it INCORRECTLY listedthat said the pedal is great The problem people have with the pedal as I can see it if they say it or not is that some sounds DONT HAVE THE SAME SUSTAIN AS A PIANO OR SYNTH SOUND It has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to pump the pedal to keep sustain and not wash out the tone this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth I have a casio wtk4200 I believe it is as good as you need As said any oversustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again which is the true art of it 30 bucks robbers great pedal funny story about getting this thing,positive
Amazingly sturdy for the It isnt as sturdy as some but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands It folds up very nicely Id buy it again Nice stand for the,positive
these picks are nice Theyre great for metal if you like a durable pick The paint fade away after a while but dont let that stop you It leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time Beast Pick,positive
First I dont like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my Fender Blues DeVille 410 sound distorted they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal Theres a difference Think about it if you dont get itSecond I dont like having a lot of pedals I play in a rockcountry band were we play music that sounds like Neil Young Tom Petty CCR etc Just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of 145 chords and an occasional minor 6th I just want an overdrive my Digitech Bad Monkey and my Arion tuner but I need distortion when we do covers ACDC Hendrix etc The DeVille can do Hendrix if you turn it up to 7 But of course then its too loudBased on those criteria the DigiTech CM2 is PERFECT The Classic overdrive setting allows me to sound like Hendrix or rocking Neil Young or any other rock band from the 60s and 70s The Modern setting allows me to sound more like 80s and 90s rock eg Guns n Roses and SoundgardenAnd this is important both settings make my amp sound like IT is being overdriven It sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point It sounds fricken awesome It does not sound like an amplified pedalSo I can use the Bad Monkey Ive reviewed it on Amazon if you want to read it for boosting my clean sound I use the CM2 if I want to play dirtier and for covers Two pedals plus the tuner and I can play everything I want Im happy Can I rate it ten stars,positive
I admit Im not the guitar flatpicker some of my friends are but I find this pick to be perfect for picking mandolin The picks have almost zero flex to them meaning the player has solid control I like emeven if they are purple Perfect Picks for Flatpicking,positive
It works perfect with Cakewalk Music creator 5 and a Digitech vocalist Best price out there I like it,positive
I have Snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews When I use my music stand I just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job This is that deviceI leave it on my stand and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger and its on and I can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the Snark head tuners In addition this one has a metronome I like this very much and may well buy anotherEnjoy No complaints,positive
filter works very well and looks professional only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure works well and looks pro,positive
simple easy to use tuner awesome price works on guitars and basses i am very happy with this product very portable too great tuner for a great price,positive
These have the correct thickness and texture that I want but they are smaller than a typical pick So be sure to try them out first before buying One just cannot tell the size from the picture Amazon has I wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick may be dim the ref image a little so people wont get confused Some people swear by these but I that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two May be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration I wont be buying these again Smaller than normal picks,neutral
I seem to have problem with getting it to 34hear34 low E of all strings but it is very compact and convenient to use Works fine,positive
I got this for our church I got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall They where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly Stands,positive
Having a neckheavy Epiphone SG G400 I really like this strap because it is not only comfortable but also provides enough friction to keep the guitar in place without much effort Leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button nice comfortable strap,positive
THIS is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest Ive tried dozens of od pedals in the past I hate this term boutiques and non boutiques before I finally stick with SSBS Mini OD as my alwayson pedal cos that thing is a supersonic bad ass since it could cover my needs on clean boost edgeofbreakup clean sound distortion or even a messed up broken speaker fuzz tonez only with your guitar volume knob please note that youll need to have a treble bleed circuit to do thisOkay back to this EHX Im kinda tired of messing around with guitar volume knob on the mini so I bought this Hot Tubes as my clean breakup sound so that I could hit it hard with a cranked up Mini OD And this my friend JESUS APPROVED The point is this pedals so great and has a great range of dirt also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range Its literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps I can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeperPS Look at the price do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal Just get it try it and see if you like it jeez Best kept secret forget them boutiques,positive
If youre a professional and youre JOB is music then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality However if youre just doing it as a hobbyside job or even just want the mics for a PA system then its really hard to beat what you get in this deal here The deal is fantastic I use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and theyve been perfect for me Great Budget Mics,positive
This little guitar stand works very well I like it much better than the larger stands that support a guitar by the neck Great little stand,positive
They feel great last longer than any other string I ever used and most importantly they sound terrific The medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges My Taylor is much louder now that I use theseHowever you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light My Favorite Acoustic Strings,positive
Wow I have been impressed with a lot of Joyos products but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended and hasnt disappointed I held off a little bit until the price came down but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny its sold for and then someAs the description says this is a mild overdrive It wont give you the Brown Sound Its not meant for metal Its almost like adding a tubeamp gain knob to your existing rig add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out Unlike many tube overdrive pedals this thing has tons of volume on tap You can set the Drive to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone as opposed to an effect that transforms it In that respect it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD3 Overdrive which is a vastly underrated pedal though the OD3 probably offers more gainThe Focus knob is interesting it doesnt act exactly like a tone knob As you turn it up it doesnt remove bass but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone The lower settings are bluesy the higher settings are bright and dynamic But chances are both will sound goodThere are some concerns you could have about the build quality the switch may not be built to last 20 years and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying I also wish theyd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side But those are mostly minor gripes Its an excellent overdrive and an incredible value Everyone raved about itand they were right,positive
The tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode The screen could be a little brighter Otherwise no complaints Nice tuner Could be brighter,positive
This thing is useless Good idea but way too lightrickety to be useful Unless youre constantly aware of it 99 of the time youll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it Pass on this Pass on this too light tips over constantly,negative
Quick release around the neck strap system Unbeatable for acoustic especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy I would recommend this to anyone 8203 Best acoustic strap holder anywhere,positive
I bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great There are 2 light sources and each has a choice between 1 or 2 lenses for brighter or softer light The plugin accessory is great and my pedal board has an outlet It runs fine on batteries also Very pleased A wonderful light for the music stand,positive
This mic has amazing quality I was recording my music on a USB condenser mic for about 2 years Feels great to finally have professional sounding music Check out my soundcloud soundcloudcomljaymusic Really dope mic First Professional Mic,positive
Having 250 feet of xlr xlr mf cables that can be used any way I want eg 2 ea 125 foot for stereo 1 250 foot for mono or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work is very flexibleThe packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord white to store them when not in useAs all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job I ended up using all 10 of the 25 cords for mics and amplified speakers plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect You can never have enough xlr cables or adapters Absolutely no complaints,positive
Works for me But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it They made it thinner so it doesnt stretch the strings too much as a consequence it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona California is concernedSuggestion to Planet Waves I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings redesign the mount say with a Velcro so that its still hangs on the sound hall but its attached to the strings Its possible to attach your product in a different way because Ive modified mine to my personal preference works without splitting the screen As advertised,positive
First of all I use this as more of a 6 band EQ using the lower and highest more for LP and HP filters The middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone You can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders The box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but I tend to set and forgetIn reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpfulIf you turn your gain way up you will have hiss Period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that I have been exposed to Have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or ampEQ is to ENHANCE your tone not create it A Strat cannot be made to sound like a Les Paul and vice versa Your tone is made up of many many variables The resulting tone can be SHAPED or COLORED by adding or subtracting certain frequencies That is the function of an EQ nothing more IT can range from dramatic to very subtle Very small changes can have large effects Small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics I am able to produceI tend to put the EQ in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment If you know how to use EQ this box is ROCK SOLID,positive
I bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers Thus far I am very pleased Some of my guitar effects require at least 320 milliamps which this adapter handles with no problems I have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either It does its job reliably and well I would definitely recommend it to a friend Great product Works well for most of my devices,positive
This is better than a gig bag for sure and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric Now its not padded really well and doesnt look like itll hold up for more than a few years but it was cheap It seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly which is why I drop a star Its oknothing special,positive
What makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to 8 pedals It comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using Powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc Even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal Also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clipOne of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they dont stick straight out on pedals that have side jackstakes up less room on your pedal board Also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cablesThe other great feature is the power capacity is greater than bossit can put out up to 1700mAwhich is how it can run up to 8 pedalsA great item at a great price No brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more Best inexpensive adapter kit for your boss type pedals sorry boss,positive
Works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well Ive tried other passive volume pedals that didnt workthis one works Worth every penny Great functionality in a wellmade pedal,positive
These picks are comparable in shape and feel to Grismans Dawg Picks and frankly cheaper The thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and depending on how you play this may or may not be acceptableIn my opinion if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge youll get a woody warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume Varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end I play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks For guitar I prefer a 1 mm traditional tricorner shape but thats a different review If however youre really a fan of a biting high treble sound these picks are probably not your best choice unless youre willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper In fact a pack of 12 three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if youre searching for your ideal toneIf you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin chances are your attack tone and volume are generally softer and I think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone Tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though youre not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and its just slowing you down For such a lighter stroke Id recommend the 1 mm tricorner I use for guitar Consider Your Technique And The Tone Youre After,positive
My son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar It hasnt failed him yet Its easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly He says its a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings Highly recommend Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter works Great,positive
The ultimate guitar cleaning tool I love love love this kit Ive been using the products for years and Ive been nothing but happy with their quality Get that guitar squeaky clean,positive
I sure wish I could afford a Fender Twin Reverb with the old spring reverbbut I dont have the funds and I dont have the back to lug one of those around anymore So my Baby Boom does the trick Its close enough for my needs I miss the old spring reverb but this pulls a close 2nd,positive
Ive tried several 34portable amps34 For the price the HoneyTone cant be beat It has volume tone and overdrive knobs the overdrive can go way too over so easy on that one Comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter important note reverse polarity negative central Interestingly I have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acousticelectrics or piezobased pickups better than magnetic pickups But for a small portable lightweight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone they dont come much better It has a belt clip on the back but youll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them Battery is included Of course a guitar cable is a required extraWell worth the money Awesome little amp,positive
Another excellent gadget from Planet Waves What a great idea Already has made my life easier Keep a pile of Jazz IIIs in the concave pocket shallow depression for holding stuff I dont own any very expensive guitars so Im not concerned about resting their bodies on my carpet The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible and that means youre more apt to grab your axe and play moreWhen unweighted by the guitar neck the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily No big deal at allEDIT Just purchased another one an axe close at hand is an axe you will play Thats been my experience After living with this for a few days one thing has become an annoyance when theres no guitar holding it to the table its very easy to knock it off the desk The way it is designed is such that the leverage has a seesaw effect that will have it fly a few feet across the room Because it sticks out horizontally just a nudge with a knee and there it goes So if you have picks or anything sitting in the round holder area it can be an annoyanceI do use these for my guitars but I feel much more comfortable using a proper stand The product is worthwhile for a quick location for setting down your axe without searching for a standIf the product had a way of either using suction or tab to secure itself to a surface it would earn another star Simple and useful but doesnt instill a lot of confidence,neutral
I purchased this product to replace the pins on my Martin 016NY I believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably Additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar Very Impressive,positive

Ive been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend When they finally gave out I got in the habit of using the noname cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones eventually fail midcable I dont mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable This cable is actually cheaper 12 or so shipped and its holding up pretty well These are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I havent needed it Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs 12 shippedIncidentally these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amps input Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab You want to use unshielded cables for that purposeEdit More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended there are probably better values from Hosa Monster or Planet Waves So far so good Will revisit at the 6 month mark,positive
I play guitar and stand behind the vocalists If this does not bring their voices back to me I can8217t hear especially on some of the female solo pieces It is big help 8211 be better if we could eliminate the buzz it causes in the church8217s sound system For the guys in the back row it is a must,positive
This is my second black suede leather strap Ive bought from Levys I love them The 2534 is wide and comfy The strap is soft I have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart Theyre high quality And they offer plenty of length adjustments without any buckles or metal of any kind Soft comfortable,positive
This is not a great quality microphone But thats not what I was expecting when I paid 25 for the mic and stand I bought this for my group of kids in a worship school I need some less expensive equipment to play on So it works well for that Its worth the money,positive
If you have a better mic you can plug that into the transmitter as its a simple mini jack 1834 and that helps this sound wise quite a bit I will say range is not great it wont go 500 feet like my expensive Sennheiser kit but this will go about 30 feet line of sight before cutting outNote its VHF not UHF so it is more prone to interferenceI find the transmitters to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well I also wish it was an XLR connection A lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so dont toss this around or it WILL breakFor general use in doors its decent and for sure worth the pricebut if youre looking for something clear you should look to spend at least 500 on a wireless lapel or handheld system Decent needs a better mic,neutral
My Epiphone SST Classic didnt have the strap pin so I took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place as I dont want to do another hole to my guitar I left it there but Im afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground so I bought these Fender strap blocks and I use it on my two Epiphone guitars that I cant use the Planet Waves Strap lock with My other Epiphone guitar is an Epiphone HummingbirdThey work great I would buy these again Works as a charm,positive
These cables are good XLR noisefree cables With these cables I am able to get good sound out of the behringer XM1800S microphones ships as expected,positive
If you are picky these are all eye candy nice flexible easy to hold and I received on time at a great price Nice group of Picks,positive
This stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it The only minor problem I have it with it is that it begins to get a little wobbly once you start to bring it near its max height Great Stand for the Price,positive
Ok so I just installed these things for my KRK 6s no standsjust sitting on two other speakers What can I say The bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk but these things have made a ton of difference My stereo image even feels wider nowSure theyre a little pricy but heyTHEY WORK If thats what they want to charge for them and people continue to buy them Im cool with that Im happy with the reults my 40 got me55 Auralex Does It Again,positive
Always the best string I buy I like the Martin coated as well but I prefer the elixer This is the first set I baught for my electrics but so far so good Always the Best,positive
I use different kinds of picks this one is very special the strings rings out really pleasant and great for speed picking too Dunlop Jazz III Pick,positive
I wasnt quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards I figured Id give this a try I am so glad I did I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board yuk Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color Id like to say it looks like new but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretchBut it looks a heck of a lot better almost new I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics but its still a 67 USA made Fender I have such faith in this that Im going to do my 77 Gibson acoustic nextThen I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them This stuff is great Fantastic Product,positive
Purchased this for my son to use on his guitars He absolutely loves it Has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars Prompt shipping great price great product Fender Treated Polishing Cloth,positive
Behringer doesnt have the best of reputations but some of their gear does a great job at the price This is one of them This gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones I run a project studio with an Apogee Duet as my interface I needed this because sometimes I need to monitor something while another person in the room is recordingmonitoring a trackMy main headphones are Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro Sennheiser HD 555 Sony MDRV6 and then I have some others All of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and I get very good volume and even at the exact same volume as the input I find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp Its hard to describe but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger Ive had a Presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little Behringer headphone amp and the sound was no betterThe volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that I can hear that is introduced by this amp Make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in For instance if I run a cable from my iMacs builtin headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume I can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds but thats not the amp its the source Running the output from my Apogee Duet the sound is very clean and strongThere are some annoying things about this amp Obviously the external power supply is annoying theres no onoff switch and its light enough that when everything is plugged in it doesnt want to stay in place However thats nothing that Velcro tape on the desk cant fix and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones Sometimes Behringer gets it right,positive
But dont let that deter you That just means it will breakin that much more quickly My favorite strap is not padded in any way like this strap but a little wider I use this on a Telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar I hooked a couple4pcs Round Head Strap Locks Black for Guitar Schallerstyleon it and away we went The strap is made in Canada from decent quality leathernot bonded and the gold Fender logo is understated yet classy Its a classic strap from Fender What else is there to say Its really thin,neutral
I bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano Ukulele I found I like the snark better for the dollar more in cost the other has multi use bass chord ukulele and seemed cheap I liked the snark so much I bought this one for my concert ukulele you might ask Huh why one for each ukulele if you play then the answer is simple for 10 bucks I do not have to hassle swapping tuners out and can just grab my ukulele and go Love the snark,positive
These things are terrible One wouldnt fit in my soundboard another wouldnt lock in my mic Plain and simpleif your looking for crap that doesnt workbuy this Crap,negative
I pretty much just leave these on all the time It gives a good boost and body to my tone with out being to distorted and dirty but if you want that type of sound you can get itGreat price too Great multinational pedal,positive
Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that Ive ever come across Ive been a Kyser Capo gal for many many years but this capo has that one beat by a mile There was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars I tried it on or which fret I placed it on As I strummed each string to sound was so clear Its also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open without any stress to your hand until you release your grip to clamp it into placeI do believe the folks at Planet Waves have developed the best capo ever And the price aint so bad either Best Capo Ever,positive
This is an awesome capo Its sleek lighteasy to install you can do it with one hand and looks nice on the instrument I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do I love the dial its very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where I can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz Awesome product much better than using a Kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck Sounds great on my SG and my acousticFor those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough I think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me Great capo,positive
I love this uke it came fast such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdysounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it amazing ukulele,positive
My aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it Its been in heavy use 1 hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and I dont think weve even had to replace the batteries yet Its got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust We tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasnt loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust This one is great Great metronome,positive
I ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly It arrived in a large box and within in the Fender Amp box I guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection Sadly when I tried to use them amp it didnt work I checked the wall plug cord flicked several switches and knobs but still didnt work Needless to say I sent the amp back to Amazon which was quick and painless I wanted an exchange I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me But I was shocked to find out that as soon as the return UPS label was recorded at the UPS store they shipped out another amp And it arrived in 4 days since I returned the first one WOW Thats customer serviceThe amp is great Small footprint sounds great for what I want it for which is bedroombasement practice amp Does its job very nicely I explored the FUSE software and the potential is almost endless Honestly I dont think I will every fully utilize the full capability of the FUSE software I just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there I may use someone elses uploaded presets and play with the various options later on In summary 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service it didnt work,positive
The picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order They work well after adjusting them to fit The thumb picks did not work so well for us it was too big for me to get to fit in any way and too small for my friend to use Good picks for price,positive
It works great not much I can say beyond that good product,positive
i ordered a couple from my guitar sellerenjoyedsaw these and tried againthe box for tuner was a little smushedbut well packaged and arrived on timewill order again if neededenjoy i own a few,positive
This is a pretty cool product I have mine next to my computer because I am constantly waiting on video to render and I am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand It is also good to have when I am using Garage Band and need to set the guitar down for a second If you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it wont work the guitar wobbles and falls out but it works great on carpet The pick bucket is a nice touch keeps picks from scattering all over my desk The rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves I would recommend this Great product but only works on carpeting,positive
When they say small they mean small I had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger and my hands are not large by anyones standardsFind the same slide in Large and I wrote a complimentary review there Great slide poor fit,positive

Besides looking cool they are for sure not going to malfunction you have to pull up on the tab to get the strap to release they spin nice Good locks I like them better then the dunlops These are cool,positive
I purchased 4 of these of the four 1 was no good on arrival another failed after 2 short time uses I will not buy more The first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed Suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these For the should be more dependable Quality control at manufacturer not so good,negative
I have several Behringer pedals all placed in a Behringer 6pedal board Most of the B pedals work quite well I have no quality issues with them Some people complain about the plastic cases but they are tough and reliable unless youre in the habit of abusing your pedals by smashing them around or cant control your 34stomp34 pressure Some are better than others and this one works perfectly I have 6 B pedals one of them is a tuner and each seems to add some noise to the amp output especially when it is in quiescent mode no signal inputThis pedal placed at the end of the line just before the signal goes into the amp quiets all that noise that the other pedals generate I had to check this because I at first thought my amp was making the noise but when I bypassed all the pedals my amp was quiet which was a relief Then I needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trickThe controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust The 34sendreceive34 function is for quieting the noise you send to an additional effects pedal which seems pointless as the best way to use this is to put it at the end of the chain to quiet all the effectsThe mute function may help but when I turn on my pedal tuner this also functions as a muteI had to do a little modification of the B pedal board to make this fit in as I already had 6 pedals in place But with the removal of a couple of screws it fit into a slot meant for a longer pedalI dont actually need the onoff function on this most of the time so placing it in that sideways out of the way spot was no disadvantage I just leave it on all the time so it always quiets the noise when Im not actually playing However I can still operate it if necessary for example for the mute function if I needed thatIts aggravating to have to have a pedal to eliminate noise from other pedals but at least there is an easy solution in a noise gate like this one Works great to correct other pedal noise,positive
I can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulderActually I like the smooth side on my shoulder so it is easy to adjust position without pulling on my shirt very nice strap,positive
I put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the 34G34 string and it sounds great What a buy for the price You may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot Whatever spot you find is best for you its worth it Im going to try it on my resouke next angled it toward the G string and it sounds great What a buy for the price,positive
My hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder The gel is pretty dense so its kind of hard and squishy and very heavy I found that it just added more weight Im not using it I would look elswhere for a different product Not as good as I expected,negative
When I originally went out to place this order I was planning to order the TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function As I looked over that device and some alternatives I finally ordered the TCHelicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect how could TC Electronics put out the 34Mic Mechanic34 with a pitch correction function that didnt do anything Well those reviewers were right the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT Also I couldnt see any effect between engagingdisengaging the tone button I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects but Im very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it Should have listened to the other reviewers,negative
I purchased this as my first guitar slide I loved it for about one month then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces I almost cut myself I will never buy a glass slide again I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier mellow tone and glass is crisper louder and does not break I would not suggest this to anyone The metal ones are about the same price they dont break and sound way better Theres a reason ALL pros use metal The review below is wrong Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger all the way to the tip You dont bend your finger to play slide You retune your guitar to an open tuning Just thought I would point that out Not So Great,negative
Just like the ones in the store We mounted our two ukes on these Put our hangers in studs but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall Heavy duty and nice looking Great price You just cant beat the speed and convenience of Amazon Well pleased,positive
Good stitching no slippage Awesome strap Fits straps locks just fine Perfectly happy with this strap Thank you earnie ball Perfect for me Awesome strap,positive
Easily the best quality capo for its price Looks great on any guitar I came across SHUBB a few months back when my capo finally gave out after 12 years I bought the C1 stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars but I had to adjust it any time I went to use it on my Les Paul which has a 50s neck and fretboardOrdered off of Amazon and it shipped the same dayI just got it in the mail yesterday and it snapped right on the LP with a firm click I didnt even have to adjust it It looks amazing in use and is just the best and simplest designYou know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what Dont forget to remove it when you guitar is resting Its easy to forget its there Forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos this never effects my fret thumb or forefingerexactly what I was looking for in a capoI will have these 2 for a long time and Im a Shubb guy from this day forward Best Capo,positive
This is a modeling amp IT has several presets to emulate different sounds They factory settings for these are pretty good and all but the first bank of three can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp If you get the fender fuse software license comes with the amp you can get some pretty amazing 34pre34 sets from fender and other usersThis is not a massive cabinet so you arent going to get that 34big34 a sound regardless But for a small room its greatCommon complaint I have seen No clean channelpresetThis is not the case There are a couple of factory presets that are 34clean34 although some people want cleaner You can either adjust the gainvol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums That said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp Another doesnt and is very clean even on the factory preset cleanI very nearly got a different amp I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II I was sold when he showed me what all it could do then showed me the price for a Mustang I For 100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask forItll keep me busy for a long time A lotta amp for the money,positive
Good upgrade Fender vintage springs Use 5 of them in my case and they work well I would recommend this Awesome,positive
Ive been using these strings for many years They hold their tune for a long time and have a nice rich on the low end sparkly on the high end tone Quality has always been very consistent I play classic rock 90s alternative modern country blues and 80s metal on Les Pauls Strats Teles Rickenbackers and Gretschs Live and in the studio these strings work for everything Just great guitar strings,positive
A bargain at the offered price Gives you virtually unlimited sustain It is a good cheap addition to my effects board Sustain,positive
Possibly the best quality mic cable I have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear For the working musician or home recording man this is great Extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over Southern California and the nation Highest quality for an amazing price,positive
I compared this side by side with two other reverbs1 The Boss 63 Fender reverb2 The Electro Harmonix Holy GrailI found the EH Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switchThe TC pedal did sound nice but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy GrailI thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty badPros of the pedal several settings and with all the knobs highly adjustable mono or stero 2 inputs 2 outputs standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals I liked the spring reverb and the mod reverb which was lushCons Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail but close and still good I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot To my ears the rest were less distinctivePriced at 150 seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost moreOverall a nice pedal I cant really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars I had to compare a couple times to the EH holy grail to make my decision In the end the grail was cheaper simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion Nice pedal with lots of options but I preferred the electro harmonix,positive
I wanted a guitar I could travel with something small enough that I actually would carry around after the novelty wore off This is a great size I love the large neck size while it is smaller than a full size guitar you wont feel it much while playing The sound for something this size is really good do not expect to get a full acoustic sound This guitar is just for you to practice scales practice a tune you wont be performing with this guitar I did alot of research bought a cheap travel guitar which I hated threw it out and decided I wanted a better one compared this to the Martin Backpacker and this has the better sound the better bag and all around GREAT travel guitar The travel case is great its about the size of a violin case so you know the size Great Travel Guitar,positive
The Rogue Analog Delay is wellconstructed and feels very high quality given the price Its similar in size to an MXR stompbox though the knobs are more reminiscent of a BOSS Delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entrylevel pedalsI really have no complaints about the Analog Delay in terms of how it performs and sounds It does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about 320ms or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats Its just too bad that they werent able to stretch out the delay time a little longer perhaps to 450ms or 500ms Once you get into that territory theres a much broader array of things you can play including the U2style phrasing repeats That being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anywayBut it isnt fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy and if youre looking for something cheap and surprisingly highquality to provide ambiance the Rogue will do just fine Great value but limited to slapback and shorter delays,positive
The strap is adjustable on both ends and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder I cut it off and glued the material back together with ShoeGoo and now its great Padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring Almost perfect,positive
The Fender Vibro Champ is a great little amp Im amazed at how good this amp sounds A small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of soundThis is a 5 Watt Tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp This is a much better and louder amp than the small 100 solid state starter practice amps by all the major manufacturers Fender uses two very standard tubes for pre and amplification 12AX7 and 6V6 both are Fender branded tubes These are nice clean tubes that react consistentlyThe amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 WattsThe cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings In reality the amp packs effects for 7 different amps Tweed Blackface British Hot Rod Metal Jazz and Acoustic The first five have three different levels of style each Our other two amps are Marshalls an acoustic and a half stack If Im being really honest I like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack This is a clean simple amp to use The Marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly rightThe volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched Some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet Switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot Sadly the volume only goes to 10Once the voice is selected there are 5 effects settings possible with two or three level for each Vibratone Delay Reverb Chorus and Tremolo The FX level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied set to 1 the effect isnt used at all This is probably the least useful part of the amp There is no pedal selection so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in youre kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again Theres no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a songThere is a gain knobI like the speaker on this amp It is nicely detailed with a good warm sound The internal speaker is connected with a 14 inch jack so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple 14 inch speaker cable Very nicely done Fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker The back panel also has a 14 inch jack Line OutThis is a great small gig or practice amp The sound is outstanding The amp is used with a 1983 Gibson Lucille and a 2008 Les Paul Standard Plus An Excellent Practice or Small Gig Amp,positive
I literally just took this pedal out of the box an hour and a half ago and it has already blown me away Ive only begun to scratch the surface of what this pedal can do and ive made funkyweird loops of sound bizarre cricket noises long delays that instead of fading out actually get LOUDER with time I dont know how else to say it If you are looking for a delay pedal you just found it This thing can do anythingIt feels like the iPhone of delay pedals to me so far like it can do all this crazy cool stuff but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too Wait you can call people with an iPhoneI could have waited a week or so to really learn everything this pedal can do and write a detailed review of its performance but i dont feel i have to Its the latest BOSS delay pedal what else is there to sayAlso with the price range of 130160 dollars its a huge bargin compared to other BOSS pedals that might pull off a similar effect such as the RC2180200 or RC20XL240300 Granted i know very little about the FULL capabilities of those pedals but the DD7 has up to 40 seconds worth of loop play in Hold mode And the hold mode is so much more sophisticated that what I am familiar with since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the DD3Sorry if Im rambling but seriously Im in love with this pedal Perhaps i will post a video demo of some of the weird junk you can do with it at some point Dear god im in way over my head here,positive
If you just need an inexpensive strap that is perfectly functional at a low price then this is the one for you Works fine no problems Great strap for the price,positive
took longer than I wanted but im in cali and they are in jersey so when I got the patches they were better quality than I expected So It was cool cool,positive
I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisychainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained forThe effects are beautifully done Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wetdry knob set to a straight 12 oclock position Wet means more of the effect and dry means lessThere is a mic gain on the left side of the unit and the mic input XLR only has phantom power The XLR out goes straight to your mixer There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that featureThe unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature which I leave on It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding you can set it for minor to major pitch correction I suspect that most folks will want less of this than moreOverall this is a perfect addition to a vocalists toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive Its also perfect for adding vocal effects to small barebones PA systems It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA A lot of function in a small box,positive
Perfect chain for most rock soundsGet the 28 strand for a thicker snapI might try out the 28strand next year Im pretty happy with this one right nowThe place I live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains Has the BANG,positive
I put these on an Epiphone Les Paul acousticelectric and it sounds so great They are very smooth and warm and magical like a mythical unicorn These sound just lovely,positive
I am the kind of guy that fixes everything with duct tape and when the item is more tape than product I go to a pawn shop and buy something used and start the process again I saw this case and thought 50 bucks and its for my favorite guitar so I purchased it 2 days later it was sitting at my back door and I didnt have to pay shipping This thing is a beauty Plush interior hardware looks great and good quality Does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type Deep storage pocket and more My 12 string fits in it wroom to spare and its case is running out of room to tape so I guess Ill be purchasing another soon Fantastic Case great price,positive
XLR cables are hard to mess upthese are great They do the trick Why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap Great quality,positive

The display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle Maybe Im using it wrong but Ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs But from there it works greatjust have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a good angle Not bad,positive
These picks were a good deal They are pretty cool looking and I will be able to use them for a long time They are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks Nice cool looking picks,positive

I purchased one of these a few weeks back and loved it so much that I just had to order another one If you want comfort styple at a good price I highly recommend these guitar straps Customer comments,positive
It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items including my Line 6 wireless receivers Shure wireless receivers and several other pedals like my Cry Baby etc all at once However the transmitter for my Shure wireless inear monitor which requires less power than any of the other two items combined will not run even by itself when powered by the 1 Spot Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesnt get along with For most of my stuff it works great and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords It works great for most low power items,positive
I had bought one a few years ago when i was a little short on cash I was very skeptical that this would work for me After my guy set it up it played flawlessly to say the least Once i got my tele back and my acoustic Gibson back the life of a out of work guitar player always the pawn shops best customer but i was able to incorporate the Dean in with both of them And it gave me another electric to play This cheap little Dean guitar has turned into a favorite for me Plug it in and sit back and enjoy what comes out of it Very crisp with no noise So if your looking for a good cheap guitar to either learn on or just something that you can pick up and play And i have never had anyone tell me that it sounded horrible And it got me through some tough times That is why i just bought another one for practice I hope that you will be able to use this review for your decision Bottom line you cant go wrong with this guitarPEACE Great guitar for the buck,positive
In our acoustic guitar band I often play intros and solos heavily amped but when the rest of the band members come in my strumming overpowers the rest So I needed a way to throttle back to either nothing or slightly amplified in between intros and solos then apply full power as needed This volume control foot pedal works exactly as described Also I had an extra 12 volt Netgear router wall wart that saves battery life during practice I use the battery during gigs Despite some comments Ive seen the battery is extremely easy to change no problem at all The device does reduce some of the signal going to my amp hence only 4 stars Works exactly as advertised,positive
very good item if you are a musician you need it cool for any bass guitar and any instrument that fit into the hanger very cool item niceeee,positive
Easy to use it was easy to put the picks in and to take the picks out of it easy,positive
I bought this based on video reviews on the net My first impressionsTo my ears if the OCD Ultimate OD simulates fat power tube distortion this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube preamp with a bit of edge sharpness the kind of edge the tube amps have The focus knob seems like a tone knob maybe more in the upper mids than the treble but it does the job wellI wish it had a bit more gain Surprisingly this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10 gives me a great metal tone all by itself If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost it gets me exactly where Id want to be a dry tight metal tone kinda 5150ish And while this isnt the purpose of the pedal it is how Ive ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps Its tight its raw there is no fizz and no boomyness just a healthy low end Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metalOver all though this is great for lightly distorted edge of distorted sounds It gave my clean tone a sharper more amp like tone that is midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff it just has that chimey vintage amp character very early marshalls older fenders with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation If your clean channel is overly flat this will liven it up to more sharp scooped tone which to my ears sounds more vintageBasically from Hendrix to modern detuned metal with a definite mids emphasis not 80s marshall mids but modern mids emphasis My favorite pedal great for metal,positive
I really like this stand It has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders It is a nice solid tubuler style guitar stand and either my electric or acoustic guiter fits well in it I highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars Great stand for the money,positive

My newest amp the Marshall JVM410 Joe Satriani replaced the reverb with noise gatesa function I absolutely love But then I needed a reverb pedal Honestly there are more expensive pedals out there but this will do exactly what they do for a lot less money Give it a try Ive been using it for a few weeks and Im extremely happy with it Meets my needs,positive
Cheap quick and easy It serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive its almost painful I havent had it break and it doesnt cause any issues with the instrument so Im more than content with this handy inexpensive capo I love when things are cheap AND good quality,positive
This pedal adds that I dont know what to your soundI chased a sound for years until buying this pedal what a differenceIf you have great top quality cable quiet amps and pedal boards shielded guitars fresh tubes you know the drill you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO there it isIt was THIS pedal for me just turn the knobs until it comes out of your speakersA must have especially if you are playing clubs bars or arenas you have a pedal board and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front give your notes clarity during leads make overdriven chords ringI like this pedal its on my board and its never coming off Something I dont know what,positive

I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70s before they came out with Delrin I like the sound and feel of these picks They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk They are a little expensive but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thingI bought the abalone ones because they look coolUPDATEI am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines and usually during a performance I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon A bit of nostalgia,positive
These strings are beyond amazing Switching to Ernie Ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar and if you do any blues playing at all Extra Slinkies are for you They bend and bend and bend are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos and give a great sound whether youre playing gritty or bright I also play country and punk and these strings let me get enough twang and beef respectively to play those styles as well The best 5 you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put Ernie Ball strings on your guitar The easiest cheapest way to maximize your sound quality,positive
Excellent picks with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth The only problem I have is that I keep changing my mind between whether I want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing These are a great addition to any mandolin players case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a Fender heavy Great mandolin pick for tremelo playing,positive
These will not wear down which is amazing and they have all the same great qualities as all the other jazz IIIs the only problem I have with them is dirt can get between the grip pretty easily which makes them slip but if you clean them well then its not a problem Indestructable,positive
I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d28 and remove the bridge pickup This left the saddle too low to the neck I researched the Tusq products and found enough people impressed to give it a try Im pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain Ill do this to my other acoustics as time goes on Tone Plus,positive
Always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firmYou just found itThis is an exemplary capo No surprise as its designed by Ned Steinberger who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics Its made of serious aluminum and the spring is supersolid The tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it wont come off again until you loosen it No slippage here This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so its even less in the way of your hand a very useful feature which most other onehand capos cant offerIts an easy oninseconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets The rubber is wellbonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least unlike many cheap capos It sits well on any sixstring though is not flat enough for a classical But most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric unless youre Albert Collins who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here so this will cover all your basic capo needsIts got a little slot for the DAddario brand tuner but I use a Snark and these two go together well put on the capo activate the tuner on the headstock tune it up and away you go perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo If youve ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo this is a godsend combo The capo also has a little pick slot which will comfortably take up to about a 73 mm pick It fits 60 picks perfectly by the wayThis NS Artist Capo is well worth 2025 bucks and since I got it my Shubb and Kysers have sat lonely in the cornerIf you havent ever experimented with capos try them out They can really change the way you play your guitar and may help you find you sing better than you think as we all have our best keys and a capo can help you find yours I love playing bluegrass licks in G while capoed at the second fret for instance The extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and its almost like another instrument This goes for every fret pretty much up to about the sixth where it gets a little crampedAll in all this is the best capo Ive ever used especially for this quality at this price The perfect onehand capo for six strings acoustic and electric,positive
It is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor As long as the guitar is on it works great Works for what it is made for,positive
this mic gives a great range of recording purposes Seems well built and rugged the only complaint I have is that the face plate on the front fell off after only a month of light use they must use a cheap adhesive for it I had to clean both surfaces and give it a dab of gorilla glue to get the plate back on great audio quality but the front plate fell off after a month,positive
It took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic But with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio A good mic for the price,positive
This looper is serious worth every cent I spent on it Very simple easy to use and takes up less space on my pedal board than my Altoids tin The sound quality is perfect I can record a loop and play it back through this thing and it still sounds like I am playing instead of a recorded loop assuming I end the loop correctly I run this in my effects loop of my ac30s after the preamp and all the distortion I run beforehand big muff od boost all get captured clearly coming out of this pedal The range of the loop level is perfect just over noon and you match the input signal and over that allows you to boost your loop for a little more dynamicsI chose those over the digitech jamman express xt and I have to say it was worth the extra money even though the sales person was a little disappointedIf you want a simple loop this is the one it takes a little learning but once you figure it out you will love it FanFreakingTastic,positive
Had no issues in the 2 months There is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your real picks which helps with its looks Sticks well looks better,positive
I have them in purple which makes them stick out They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin Already planning on purchasing more Love these,positive
This is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom 505 gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff Honestly the best effect it held was the phaserjet pipe effect I got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted It does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price bodow from Trinidad Boss is the Boss,positive
I have used alot of different mics over the years to mic drums and this Microphone is actually good enough for vocals and sounds decent through my mixer I would reccommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants a good peice of sound equipment Great Mic for the money,positive
I got 2 of these for my Electric guitars They do indeed work and the stand legs are decent DO be careful when unfolding as pinching of skin would be very easy The guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy The guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well I have had no problem with the foam cushion so far I have modern finishes on my guitars I dont think I can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing My Epiphone LP seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the Turser Strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault I also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include All in all these arent bad Not quite perfect but a good value for the money Works but careful,positive
Purchased two of these one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other ampsspeakers Works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect No humhiss from these units at all Works very welll,positive
I was sure glad that I ordered this cable as a backup It gets the job done and seems durable for my needs Nice Cable,positive
Surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable Works well with polish on natural wood instruments I plan to get another one for my laptop computer because of its cling quality to dust Amazing cloth,positive
I occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls Im also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast andor recording audiobooks When I first opened this package I was struck how sturdy and professionallooking this microphone was Even the case impressed me The travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itselfThe microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand One thing I didnt like was having Reaper pushed on me Ive successfully used Audacity for years and even more important its a free program that does everything I ask of it I installed Reaper and immediately disliked its interface It also repeatedly yelled at me about how if I used it past 60 days it was going to make me pay for it I didnt like its tone so I uninstalled it MXL really should reconsider its association with ReaperI tested the Microphone on a phone call using Google Voice Everyone I spoke with said the voice quality was superior to the cheaper mike Ive been using I also tested it with Audacity in recording my voice Again I was very happy with the resultsThe packaging materials said that I should have received a CD in the package I looked everywhere but couldnt find it apparently I need it for something called a custom Grahic User Interface GUI I emailed technical support and Im still waiting to hear back Not coolSo Reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding Nice But Had Two Issues,positive
I am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the Boss ME 70 multieffects pedal This unit sounds good and is adjustable It appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it There is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use There is no 34subtle34 setting on the flanger and so when it is on you know it I think it is pretty cool and I mostly use it on my Fenders when I looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive A pretty darn good flanger,positive
I love this pedal That said I would like to address some of the reviews I see on here I have been playing guitar since I was 14 years old I am now 57 so I have a few years of experience First you guys who complain about the plastic housing Are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals If you are stop doing it All you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works The plastic housing is extremely strong and wont bust when used properly The next thing I would like to address is the battery running down 34even when its turned off34 Every effects pedal I ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it Get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain It will save you a fortune The ones saying the sound sucked buy something besides a 50 amp and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain Thi is a good pedal and Ive used it on stage for 2 years without a problem That means I have spent about 11 a year for a pedal that has earned me Thousands Buy one learn how to use it and youll be happy Good Pedal Get One,positive
As it is with most things in life you get what you pay for and while this Hosa effectsconnecting cable isnt the best quality cable that is out there eg Zaolla Evidence etc it certainly does the job its supposed to at a reasonable price Too few guitarists and I was one of them for many years until recently pay enough attention to the quality of their cables and hence spend too much time on the amps the pick ups strings etc I discovered way too late how important investing in high quality cables is to your sound but I guess better late than never However if you are on a budget and you are looking for effectsconnecting cables that do a job for a good price then these Hosa ones will do a good enough job For me after much experimentation I have foundZaolla ZGTR110 Guitar Cableto be the best for my sound and while they are not cheap they are certainly quality and worth the money for the improved sound they provideThese Hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended Does As Advertised And Value For Money,positive
I like this string winder and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too but the 34bridge pin puller34 is too small and doesnt work on my instruments Thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of five Works well,positive
Looking for a strap that is sturdy comfortable and simple in design I use this strap along with and without the Planet Waves quick release system perfect for use when I am standing and playing I have several for our electrics and acousticsPlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help Nice sturdy simple strap,positive
These are great strings They are the right length and go on easy enough They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you arent color blind They go on sound bright and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever you only have to change them every 3 months or so I had to reply that forever just doesnt last as long as it used to Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 13 less that is a good deal even if they dont last forever That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book Worth the extra pesos Coated they last forever just not quite as long as forever used to be,positive
I been playing guitar for 12 years now I play lead and rhythm I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different some too much on the low and the others too much on the high I dont like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less It has its own level BTW Great EQ,positive
On the plus side it does the job powers your 9V pedals and doesnt break the bankon the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into Neon lighting can raise Hell with this power supplybut who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy Best to have a noise gate handyjust in case It does the job but can be noisy,positive
I quite like the sound of this thing running through a Crate acoustic guitar amplifier It sounds really natural and its easy to dial in a nice sound Its hard to hear it while youre playing youre better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you or trusting someone else to set the amp Like most of these kinds of pickups its quite susceptible to feedback so you cant get out in front of the amplifier and listen Not a slam on the productthats just the nature of the beast Im an honest to goodness terrible violinist but I got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children Its a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful It works great I dont turn it up very loudjust a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room I hate the 34short34 cord and I wish I could use a regular instrument cable but I can understand that they dont want a lot of weight pulling on your violin But the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifierunless you use some kind of little pre amp In fairness the cord is a reasonable length but Im quite tall so its 5 of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder Great sound short cord feedback prone,positive
This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there I play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen It worked but I dont use it anymore It needed to adjust,negative
The mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped There was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke I tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songsI removed the pick guard because I really didnt like how it looked and it looks fine without it The strings that come with it work fine and none snapped Even if you end up not wanting to play it you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than I would have expected The only problem I have is that the two G chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap Also another difficulty I had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on If you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out Magnificent Mandolin,positive
I got these because they were recommended replacements for the Fostex T50RP They fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads For the price they are worth it Great budget earpads,positive
Not much you can say about these theyre knobs They fit perfectly and are of high quality finish They finish off my bass nicely as I like to have the numerals there for reference Do the job,positive
I admit I bought this only because John Frusciante uses a very similar style strap But he has good taste This strap is strong and sturdy Even without strap locks Im comfortable going crazy on stage High quality does not fray stays on the guitar Does what you want and need and looks great VintageClassic look sturdy strap,positive
Tuner works well with acoustic but not so great when your electric is not plugged in Seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound Sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and its okay I also have the NS Micro and thats a better tuner Very convenient but sometime you gotta whack it,positive
Good quality well made Its a simple cable what can be said It was a good deal did the job Its a cable what can you say,positive
Havent had this long but so far its just about perfect I had bought another OnStage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness OnStage MY550 see review This one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable AND only costs a few bucks more fourteen buckos at present Ive got a 13 gooseneck and a lightish condenser mic with a shockmount on it and its as steady as can be Im convinced even heavier loads will be no problem If youre in need of a side boom look no further Rock Solid Just about perfect,positive
Have used it on a couple of ukuleles On my old dirty beginner uke that had been sitting in a closet unused for years it really made it look like new again Im satisfied cleans em up,positive
I use this stand for a smaller 50 watt Fender amp I dont think I would recommend it for larger amplifiers especially since it sits a little high but for my amp its perfect Nevertheless I also dont really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much so I cant imagine it being ideal for portability If you have a music studio and are doing more recording andor rehearsing than playing gigs this is a really nice stand Nice amp stand,positive
I use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough I can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound great sounding strings,positive
I just used this for a gig on Monday its solid well built nothing loose or floppy it stands up straight extending to almost 7 feet tall it folds up easily and is nice and compact when folded good enough for meOne further note when I ordered this I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base which is also an On Stage and screw it into this tripod thats not the case as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base Im not unhappy though this stand works quite well Solid compact and works well,positive
Didnt know what to expect for under 10 but it proved to be worth the gambleThis cable appears to be well constructed and it works fine for meamateur use infrequent setupteardownsIts a decent 15 feet long and has a locking button on the female endIm quite happy with it Good cable for next to nothing,positive
SUMMARYGreat pedal buy it youll probably keep it At its price point 5 stars I am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard Only time will tell but I like adding some vibrato for clean sounds It reminds me a lot of how I used to set up my Super Reverb amp Compared to all pedals Id actually give it 4 stars downgrading 1 star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the Rise control But I liked it so much I decided to score it at its price pointPROS dirt cheap at 25 for a new pedal sounds great does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise I wish I could say the same for some 200 pedals Ive tried LatchedUnlatched mode the best feature on the pedal I love that I can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts Small form factor normal single pedal size Standard power supply 9V Center negative runs from pedal board power or a battery The larger foot pedal surface compared to just a silver bullet switch is nice for the unlatched mode useCONS Cheap plastic case I doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case Latchedunlatched switch is small hard to reach have to bend over cant do with a toe Rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound Probably not needed on this pedal Two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability Like most pedals the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe and the settings are hard to see My favorite pedals have large knobs well marked settings you can see from a distance enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another and in the best cases enough space size and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bumpSuggested Redesign Super Vibrato or Vibrato II1 Change to a metal case2 Lose the Rise control altogether3 put the latchedunlatched modes on a 2nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes4 Increase the size of and space between the other two controls put large foot controllable knobs with high visibility knobsThen again at 25 bucks I might just buy a 2nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode A keeper I really like it,positive
I have preferred Ernie Ball Extra Lights which is a nickel string They have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference The NYXLs have a brighter tone good playing ease and stay in tune better when making new string changes If you have a mahogany body guitar such as the Les Paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same appliesThese are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are Pertaining to output I am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in 34acousticunamplified34 output but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappearsThese do stay in tune better than my usual Ernie Balls nickels when you first put them on The nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch These have their tension adjust better on the first day of use After the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference I find that by lightly sanding the nut with 1000 grit paper and using Big Bens Nut Sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other Having these NYXLs on there is just one more added benefitI would say if you are looking for a brighter tone with better tuning stability these are the ones to have You can tell from the wall to wall 5 star reviews these are the one to have Stay in tune better more top end brightness,positive
These picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness They are also a bit pointier than regular picks and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality Nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery The coolest picks in town,positive
I purchased the Planet Waves 10 Ft Instrument cable for our son to hook up his electric guitar to his amplifier It works wellno connectivity issues whatsoever Highly recommend Dependable Instrument Cable,positive
First Ive noticed that many reviews here are for the original NS tuner the one with only two buttons and coin slot battery cover This one is a little smaller has a metronome flasher and the battery installs differently but the namemodel evidently didnt change I compared this new one the original and the latest Snark on dreadnought guitar mandolin and 5string banjoPros Size size and SIZEReasonably accurateMounting clip better than beforeGood priceMetronome flasher maybe for someCons Display not as bright as othersContrary to their description this one seems less sensitive than originalBattery compartment difficult to openMay not fit well on some headstocks On my wifes A style mandolin it fits but barely On my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits That being said I havent found anything I cant use it onMy take The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy lock in speed and visibility however I really dislike the eyeball on a stick form factor and refuse to use it on stage I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument I even in leave em on in the case The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me Ill keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that DAdarrio or someone improves on it with a better processor and LED Comparison to Snark,positive
After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than regular strings I like the way they sound They are a little harder to play than the D Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar and the Martins that I have used in the past If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost Sound good but not worth the extra cost,neutral
Its a nice little amp for practice it lacks volume and low end for performance I have used it for several months with no problems Good Practice Amp,neutral
It does a fantastic job Ive had it for almost a year now still works as well as the first day Perfect condition Great preamp clear audio,positive
This audio interface is fantastic It takes a little getting used to but after an hour you will have it mastered The sound quality is great The direct monitoring is a little quiet but that is no complaint all things consideredAll in all if you need a budget system at home get this It is perfect for Mac or Pc Perfect,positive
I did the swap myself in a couple of minutes this are the Ping model 181 ratio and they stay in tune just perfect Great fit for my Fender Blacktop Strat,positive
These are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price I bought 2 to try them out and I intend on buying more Great straps at a reasonable price,positive
I bought this USA Fender product to replace an imported piece of junk Imports often have threads other than 14 inch SAE It fit perfectly on the jack socket threads Quick install works like a dream Made in USA,positive
Nice bright light I have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about 4 years As with many things Im a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music This light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything The switch is conveniently located on top of the light The clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to moveunlike my twin lights Nice bright light,positive
If youre anything like me then I know what youre thinking Digitech Digital fakesounding junk Not anymore The Digitech HardWire CM2 finishes what Digitech began with the Bad Monkey which is a great overdrive pedal in its own right But the CM2 offers tone quality that compares to the best on the market and as a pedal maniac Ive owned wayyyy too many overdrive and distortion pedals so in all humility I know what Im talking about and flexibility that is rivaled by none in the market for anything close to the priceWhat makes the CM2 so great is that like several other reviews have mentioned its not just another tubescreamer clone There is no distinct midrange hump and slightly rolled off bass that tubescreamers particularly the TS9 are known to have There is a lot of range to all the knobs the level can add some serious boost bass and treble knobs allow you to significantly change your tone if thats what youre after or you can dial it to be more but never completely transparent Also the CM2 has more gain on tap than most overdrive pedals you can go from basically a clean boost to adding a surprising amount of saturation to your tone Lastly the classic vs modified switch gives you the option of adding some gain and bass by switching from classic to modifiedIve tested the CM2 as both an overdrive to a clean channel Fender Hotrod Deville and as a frontend boost to my Bugera 1990 basically a Marshall JCM 900 The CM2 sounds great in both applications Over the clean channel of the Fender it sounds very full and smooth Even turned all the way up the overdrive never sounded very grainy or fuzzy it maintained warmed organic and tubelike Boutiqueesque is how I would characterize it Great for blues playing and Im sure that playing with the tone knobs you could dial in some good country tones as wellHowever I use it more as a frontend boost to my alreadyoverdriven Bugera amp In front of the lead channel CM2 serves to take my tone from hardrock crunch territory to a more metal tone with chunky bass and roaring highs that make palmmuted riffs sound as at home as if they were coming through a Peavey 6505As a conclusion Im really pleased with the quality of the Digitech CM2 Both the sound and build quality are topnotch and for a price similar to or less than most quality overdrive pedals on the market I highly recommend checking out the CM2 Wow Digitech has really uped their game with the CM2,positive
This is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere One note this does NOT come with any picks One customer said it did but mine did not It has a sticky pad on the back and sticks well to a wood guitar I even moved it once and it still sticks fine It is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out Handy deal,positive
Another great Roland product Really easy to use and well built very good sound great for practice Certainly do not get the RC 2 get this RC 3 model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks laterI did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big Check for sales or demos Amazingly easy to use,positive
The these strings are fantastic The sound is deep and heavy which is exactly what I was looking for Makes the bass sound pretty bad I cranked up the bass amplifier after putting on these strings and the sound is pure powerful and blew me awayWell worth the money You cant go wrong with Ernie Ball strings,positive
These do definitely have more output I really dont know what else to say about them Its all about personal preference so But if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too Oh one thing I can say is that harmonic squeals and harmonics in general are better defined and sustain longer with these Better output,positive
Works perfectly Got the drivers for Mac from the website and it instantly showed up in coreaudio Very easy to use Love it Very easy to use,positive
These strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume amplified than regular nickel steel strings Cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life I recently ordered the new MSteels from Ernie Ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more Cobalt for even better output I use P90 single coils on my Godin LG and these strings sound great They have a nice feel to them and I can bend the heck out of them No breaking No problems with slipping and tuning Im hoping the MSteels will be even better but if not these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that I was using which were Ernie Balls regular slinkys made from Nickel snappy,positive
Lightweight small simple to use and its easy to read in broad daylightCant ask for much more in a tuner Great tuner,positive
This thing works great Tiny and seems to be accurate The price is darn good as well A must for all guitarists pretty cool,positive
This is a great cable at a good price I works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables I have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable works great,positive
GLS cables are quality cables at a good price I suppose you could spend more and still be happy but why not spend less if it works as well Then spend your savings on something else Ive been happy with all of GLS products so far Good price good quality,positive
I dont like the feel or sound of these strings I bought both the 010 and the 011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil I would not buy these again I do not like them,negative
I am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar but I purchased this SN1 to replace the piece of junk first tuner I had Im very happy with the size of the SN1 Its small much smaller than I expected which was a big bonus It takes up very little room on the headstock and does not interfere when I make tuning adjustments The 34chipclip34 style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I think my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tunerThe user interface is very simple and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions The instruction manual is adequate but the SN1 seemed very intuitive for me to use The product arrived on time as shown well packaged for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change Ive had this SN1 for a couple months now and will update this review down the road Thanks for reading and if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will do the best I can to answerSPO Good things come in small packages,positive
I have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly What I love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path and have some nice touches in the way they are madeOne of those nice touches is a strain relief at both ends which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can and will introduce noise and static eventually The plugs are also of the highest quality They mate perfectly with 14 receptacles on guitars and ampsI mentioned that these are for inside playing What I mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface That is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is madeOtherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance Get one as a spare if for no other reason because I think you will be pleased with it Excellent quality and perfect for indoors,positive
The MXL 990 sounds just as every bit as good as some very expensive mikes I have used Just like with any condenser mike its a good idea to invest in a decent pop filter if you dont want those annoying popping Ps in your recordings I would recommend this mike to anyone for vocals or miking acoustic guitars in your recording studio or portastudio Also a great mike for doing voiceovers Big Bang For The Buck,positive
I ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar He uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar He swears by them and loves how they stay in his grip without slipping while picking and going nutso on his guitars Buy them you wont be sorry Plus wow its a great price Excellent picks great price too,positive
This stand easily folds and holds my Mandolin in a scratchproof stance Not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some An attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed but everything from Tenor uke and up did just fine Fender once again delivers,positive
After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar for lap playing and a Dunlop 210 glass overthefinger slide for Spanish style playing I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide Its probably a personal issue but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I dont have to worry about what would happen if I drop it In short its a winner Yes to Brass No to Glass,positive
The harmonica barely fits the holder and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica I cant get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it unless I modify it Great for people with a fat neck,neutral
Ive been using this product for a while now Only for indoor really light use So I cant speak to its durability at this time But I like it because its cheap light and it works Works good,positive
Wrestling the guitar in and out of the case when you want to practice is inconvenient This stand allow for a reasonably safe place to store a guitar when it is out of the case It even has a band across the neck of the guitar to keep it in the rack I like it as a safe stoage place as well as the ease it offers to grab my guitar and practice for a few minutes It is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price It is much safer to have my guitar in this rack than laying about in the house waiting for someone to step on my guitarupdate January 7 2013 liked the first one so much I got two more for my other two guitars I love being able to pick up one of the three and do a few licks Each one is different and now they are all three out of the their cases and at my fingertips The price is right and they keep them safely stored Nice Place to Store Guitar When Out of Case,positive
Its well made Not much else you can say about it Buy it It is worth it Packaged very well Well made,positive
They work and are fender parts Even thoigh they work on many brands Use them on all makes and no complaints todate inventory items,positive
The title says it all Great performance sub par construction I bought this pedal for the compression and sustain though and am very pleased I use it for both bass and guitar and it processes the signals well I am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also Cheaply made though I removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit The removal stopped a terrible clicking noise that would have been audible from the stage floor Plastic encasement means the unit will likely suffer noticeable wear and tear throughout its lifetime Wish it was better made Audio reproduction is great Great performance sub par construction,positive
If you like thickheavy gauge picks but find they wear too fast for you this is the pick for you They have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff but also wear as in dont wear down like nothing else These were a very nice find Incredibly Durable,positive
 This would be a musthave at twice the price,positive
If you have not used Tortex picks before I highly recommend giving them a try They are NOT flimsy plastic that cracks and splits like most of the tortoise shell picks you see These are much more flexible so they last forever The only reason Ive ever needed to get a new one out of the package is because I lost the one I was usingJust be aware that 050mm is really light for most players They do sell these in many different thickenesses and colors so give order a few different ones to see what you like My favorite is the 070mm it has the perfect balance of flex and strength The best guitar picks,positive
I had the red Snark and a couple others This one is the best ive tried so far No problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning 6 stars if they had it that high Cheers,positive
excellent Five Stars,positive
Dont know why quality instruments dont come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement The next time you change your strings check and see if your current nut is plastic If so have a few of these on hand and replace that nut You will hear the difference and they dont wear out like plasticJust make certain you get the height correct so your action isnt too high Rule of thumb grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height You can always remove more material but you cant put it back onThis is a quick easy improvement I have bone on all of my guitars very nice replacement for Stratocasters,positive
Great mic for the price Is it a SM58 No but sounds pretty damn good Its light dont know if it would handle major abuse but wowfor 12 bucks you really cant go wrong Plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup It also looks pretty damn sharp Dont see how they even afford to make these things for this price If you want a really good SM58 clone I would recommend a Behringer XM8500 If you are looking for a back up mic or you are a cheapo this will probably satisfy you I would have knocked off a couple of stars if it was over 20 bucks but for 12 bucksI dont think you are gonna find a better microphone 12 bucks For this,positive
Ive owned this and a couple of other Korge Tuners in the past and currently own threeIn the past I would use a keyboard to get the bottom E on my guitar and take it from there These days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive I keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when I go out with my guitars I also use it to tune my violin and it works greatIf you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets betterOver all for the cost you cant go wrong These used to be expensive noneessentials but today theyre small accurate and portable Small accurate and portable,positive
This was the easiest tuner I had I am sorry I gave it away now when I upgraded LOL Easy to tune,positive
I love guitar picks I have tested alot of them and this is by far the best one that I have found yet They are perfect to hold and very tough although I do wear through them quickly but I do that to all picks Best Pick So Far,positive
Works great Five Stars,positive
This is a standard on my peral board along witht he Blues Driver This little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an Over Drive pedal It is tough sounds like fire and will serve you well For 50 there is seriously no better deal The Yellow pedal everyone should have,positive
Not as sturdy as some Ive used and seen floating around but it gets the job done as advertised Not a terrible buy Construction is a bit on the cheap side though as it is mostly plastic and seems a bit fragile around the edges The clipper and winder work well though even though they are both predominantly made of the same lower grade material However all you really need are the two functions and they work Not as sturdy as some but works as advertised,positive
This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitars output while playing outside on the porch The amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the housesWe also like that this has a headphone jack which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged inHighly Recommend Note We have the Burgundy color oneCFH Very Impressed Highly Recommended,positive
This pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians Awesome tool for any guitarist,positive
I am very pleased with my Frontman 25R I purchased as a practice amp The sound quality is very clear and it has all the volume you will ever need With the gain and drive cranked up to 10 I set the volume at 3 That is all the volume I need for practicing in my home You could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10 I cranked it up to test it and the sound quality was still clear at 10 I would recommend it as a good economical all around amp Impressive Amp,positive
Good strings great for general guitar work but I do prefer the EB rock n roll strings for blues and rock playing Good strings but I like the Rock n Roll version better,positive
Apple threw a curve at me when with the new thin iMac the company eliminated not only the Superdrive but the 35mm Audio In port that had been highly useful on previous models especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord After trying a Griffin and Logitech device I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface there are 2 other very similar models by Behringerthe UCA202 and the UCA222 What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanentlyattached dedicated USB cord Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac though monitoring required more cords in backughFor a committed neophyte like me the UFO202 was probably sufficient I miss the permanently attached USB out cable and moreover am questioning whether Ill ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB which to my eyes has a bit of a learning curve The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual Instead of separate sections the manual uses small thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructionsa minor but unnecessary inconvenience But give Behringer credit for providing a manualI thought I was investing in more versatility for a modest price increase than what the Behringer UFOUCA line of interfaces offered me But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording soundonsound My present programs Sound Studio and Toast cant do it but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better If not the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMacs desk space Apples elimination of the internal burner gives the company thin screen bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and spacethanks to the new requirement of an external burnerBehringer has presented the best solution Ive been able to find to Apples surprising and dubious omissions with the latest iMac If your uses include mixing and if you have the space were talking a mere inch or two the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks But if you have a UFO or UCA interface your needs may already be covered Im not so sure now that I have it a new iMac users perspective,positive
The perfect wall mount for a ukulele My daughter loves it Instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs Simple and Great Looking,positive

My old pair of JBL Studio Pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost At the time mid 1990s these were the best you could expect for computer monitors I do mixing and voice overs so I needed the real deal After extensive research and listening I decided on the MAudio BX5a deluxe For the price they can not be beat Punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range They are also very accurate I hear things just the way they are recorded They also bring to light subtleties in old CDs that I have never heard before Also the wood construction gives these speakers a warmer resonance than others made out of plastic or metal If you have a studio on a budget and need the best speakers for under 50000 buy these Remember they are studio monitors so the audio is going to be very directional so use them for monitors Great speakers for portables like an Ipod One note you need a really good sound card to get the most from these babies Great Monitors,positive
I have always liked these sticks They are solid look good and feel good You will always get quality from vic firth Only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as Vaders Good sticks,positive
I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string Have 2 problems with the strings First the bass E 11th string broke while tuning it up Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not Elixir I have changed strings many many times so I am convinced it was not my stringing but a weakness in the E string itself Second the high D 8th string seems dead it does not ring as it should and as the other high strings do though none as much as other 12 string sets Ive used Considering these strings cost much more than others I certainly am disappointed in them Hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good Not up to Par,negative
JCM800 in a 30 dollar box Not quite You cant really get there without actual tubes being distortedTo me its good for getting that kind of over the top wild 80s midrangey Marshall sound To me though it sounds too much like a pedal and not enough like the real deal To me the Hot Plexi sounds more real closer than this That being said this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexiBUT if you turn the tone down and scoop your amps mids significantly Im talking about 2 of 10 on the knob where 0 of 10 is too much and gives you Kill em all style hollowness that isnt good it gives a nice dark throaty lowermid rich tone that would be great for metal Yes youre not supposed to scoop the mids on the amp but this pedal is nothing but mids and scooping them tames the fizzyness So its like Ghostbusters sometimes you just gotta cross the streams and it works to filter out some of the harshness Im not even talking about Vintage Metallica scooped its just scooped enough so it doesnt sound harsh in the high end and mids and sounds more like the Black Sabbath to Scandinavian metal tone I like to dial in basically dark and dry has a ton of mids but doesnt sound like Boston at allI use it with a Marshall Class Five pedals tone at about 3 of 10 Amps tone controls Marshall Class 5 through a 4x12 at Bass 3 Mids 1 or 2 treble 6 set to headphone mode for a darker tone Cheesy or modern your choice,positive
This is a distortion pedal It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl Its pretty harsh in tone kind of a white noise distortion The DS1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp You can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh soundingThat said the DS1 does exactly what I wanted it to My amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style The DS1 gives me the 80s metal and punk rock sound I wanted and it does so flawlesslyIt took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS1 Its BOSS so it will last foreverTh only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing but word to the wise dont pay more than 40 new for this thing The go to distortion pedal,positive
This was an impulse buy After playing the guitar for many years I thought a ukulele would be a fun addition and I was right This one proved that you dont have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument It has a great sound appears to be good quality and well made all for a very reasonable price At first it didnt seem to stay in tune for more than a day I decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months If your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot this is a nice instrument Nice instrument with good sound,positive
great leather strap nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth it wont dig in Ur shoulder like some other straps out there and u can adjust it i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i dont like to play low like to my knees that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and it gives me A great angle for my wrist to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck so i say great buy i give it 5 stars ,positive
I play with fingernails and just cant control standard metal banjostyle fingerpicks because I cant feel the strings I used Alaska picks for years which are very good These are better They give the control of nails yet the tone and protection of metal and I can feel the strings Muting harmonics everything If you play with nails and want finger picks these are for you best fingerpicks for someone used to fingernails,positive
Good quality cables bright colors make identification easy when hooking up to a mixer this makes it easy to follow whats going to where good connectors and nice flexible cable does the job very well with care they should hold up well thumbs up for GLS Nice Cales,positive
For me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great valueIts the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages However its the attention to small construction details that I love The XLR ends are quality components but cheap ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothlyAnother factor is the strain reliefs at each end Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable which will often occur at cable ends on cables without themOf course the color coding is a godsend I can now tell at a glance what is connected to what both live and in my home studio I have not experienced any extraneous noise using these but I am careful to eliminate sources or route around them Still these are as good as any other cables I have purchasedIll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision I was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk Not the case I can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for Perfect for live or studio,positive
for the price and effect itself u can not get a better dealuse it for my acoustic guitar pedal board though it just does the job and im more than satisfiedit works awesome with electric guitar too just get it awesome,positive
Absolutely Obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock1970s influences I would probably buy the Phase 100 today though as it has 4 different positions to choose from I assume including the original setup as one of themWell I need to correct this This review was for the OLD models The NEW models have FAR too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified I thought I was replacing an old model with the NEW one but alas the NEW is not worthy of a place in my effects chainI will probably get an EH Small stone now though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too Sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by nonmusical business men who care ONLY about the bottom line and NOT enough if AT ALL about the soundquality of their products The capitalists have become too greedy and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live God help us Old circuit was an Irreplaceable Classic,neutral
Ive used 4 different brands of clipon tuners to tune my Classical guitars and electric basses but this tuner is the most accurate It captures the note immediately without errors whether the low E on an electric bass guitar or the high E on my classical guitar It is fast enough to use real time during intonation practicetraining on fretless bass It works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments Takes a little getting used to but simply if the rings spin clockwise the note is sharp if the rings spin counterclockwise the note is flat If you can afford it the Peterson is the best clipon tuner out there The last tuner youll ever need to buy,positive
Regardless of the string itself I insist on honesty in advertising and marketing So when I was earnestly considering ordering this string I read the summary in which it was statedElixir Strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your DNA and other contaminantsOhhhh protects my string from DNA Yeah that DNA really messes up guitar strings all right In fact its the worst contaminant EVER worse even than the oils and acids on our skin worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the DNA from exposure because the DNA is the blueprint of those cells contained deep within protective walls But somehow that nasty ol DNA leaks out and contaminates our guitar stringsHonestly Its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musiciansAs I read the reviews I noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo I noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from Amazon HmmmmThe first honest review I found was one which said These strings sound somewhat artificial Ah finally one of the REAL reviewsLook the product may be good or not It may be the best string ever or not But am I going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently cant stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hypeWere musicians not morons If you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing A quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life No matter how heavy the marketing hype if the string is bad youll only sell one set If its good you dont need the hypeEDIT FOLLOWUP After reading numerous reviews this does actually seem to be a good set of strings Which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldnt need spin to sell Just sayin Honesty is the first key in marketing,neutral
I bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and I found them to be extremely simple and quick to install The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wallIf you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good tight spacing I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldnt be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures so I will have to do new pictures but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with theseThe easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theBlack Decker BDL100AV AllInOne SureGrip Laser Leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 30 minutes I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professionallooking installationAs far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shapeI DO NOT however recommend buying theString Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediatelyEDIT I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole Just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line At any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go Perfect solution for my guitar collection at least some of it,positive

I ordered TM50BK unit but after a couple of delays with my local delivery agent decided to buy a unit locally which turned out to be the Korg Beat BoyThe Beat Boy is everything that this unit is and then some In addition to the metronome and tuner it has a record function and drum tracks in all 100 different patterns The units have an almost identical front panel with the metronome patterns in with the drum options the extra buttons for the record and an external mic for acoustic instrumentsHad I seen the Beat Boy first I would have ordered it instead as I was looking for a drum machine anyway The functions which are shared between the 2 units work really well the tuner is accurate and fast and cant fault the metronomeI will probably keep the TM50BK as a spare but Im also glad my local shippers have prolonged the wait If you just want a metronome and tuner this is a fine unit but if youre considering a drum machine too look at the Beat Boy before making any decisions Korg Beat Boy,positive
I play guitar and its necessary to have the mic angled toward me to sing Long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate This little boom gives me a way to get close to my mic without having a long boom cluttering up the stage Great product Handy dandy little item,positive
Perfect for my obscure useI discarded the mic clip or more so added it to my collection and attached a RAM mount to the gooseneck Now I have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post What to do with it I use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights No more holding a little phonesized thing up to my face for hours on end This stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision Small Portable Cheap Functional,positive

The two violins we ordered came on time and were packaged very well All pieces that were advertised were included The items appear as pictured It is hard for me to rate this purchase as I am still trying to get it in tune I am using a snark clip on tuner and have yet to get the strings in tune We purchased peg drops to help with the tuning but still have been unsuccessful in bringing them into tune Still trying to get it in tune,positive
I usually use Martin SPs but I decided to give these a try Im pleased with them but I would not rank them above the SPs I did a little recording with them and I have to admit they sounded a little brittle Worth a try,positive
This acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever It has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well I couldnt be happier with the purchase Its a very good investment if you play guitar but dont have an electric acoustic I dont think Ill ever even buy an electric acoustic now since I have this thing Prolly sounds better anyway Just awesome,positive
Nice amp for the money but couldnt push a single Peavey SP218 Sub so I moved this amp to push a pair of dual 15s still had trouble getting the range that I needed so I have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single EV18 sub rated at 500 watts it should handle it nicely bridged I will keep you posted Nice amp for the money,neutral
Cables are cables They usually all work And with Amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality Works good good price,positive
Im working on new strumming patterns and these were exactly what I needed to soften things up just a bit Perfect,positive
These strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned I bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand The owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup I like the lighter sounds out of them and using a capo makes them sound great also These seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of Ernie Ball strings and I am planning on trying them out on another guitar soonThey seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well I use them on an electric acoustic and I am happy with the sound when i play through an amp First set of Martins definately not my last,positive
This works just as stated Now I can plug my mic in either way and it gives me more versitility very nice,positive
These strings are great for all sorts of playing styles I bought a set of 9s and 10s and I also have some DAddario 11s The 9s are super slinky just like the name says Theyre great for quick movement around the fret board My only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding I play a lot of rock and sometimes these just dont pack a punch like the 10s or 11s do All in all though these are great strings and I will definitely continue to buy Ernie Ball Ill probably opt for 10s or 11s though Great strings,positive
I use this to run a single mono XLR shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my Tascam DR40 which saves me a step in postproduction The quality is fine and it does what its supposed to do Good price for a good product Does what it needs to,positive
I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands There is of course very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny but hey its just a 9 volt battery I just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device They put a lot of thought into this amp and it is outstanding for the budget price Keep in mind you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it I will at some point run my Boss Digital Delay box through it to check that out The belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice and I got it in red as a change of pace because I always get 34black34 with my equipment It looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character Nice product Danelectro Perfect for outdoor practicing,positive
Stopped working all by itself Fresh battery didnt helpFortunately Ive another plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch Ive 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsThe Intellitouch is simply champion Condolences for mine,negative
What can I say I started out with a couple of pedals then a wah then more then a board for them and sooner or later all those 634 cords are either in the way too short or whatever I do like the malemale offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board youve got odd distances This kit does the trick and truly was easy to use Only once did I create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it Simple way to clean connections,positive
If you like Jazz Guitar picks and if you like Tortex picks this is the perfect marriage These are the best Enjoy Great Picks,positive
I have used a variety of these types of adapters in the past and these are an excellent newer version In this case I bought just one quick release to use for mounting a kick drum microphone that has the stand adapter permanently attached to the microphone With this quick release installed on the stand and the microphone the kick drum microphone now mounts to the stand in mere seconds and stays in place very wellI dont quite know why the locking ring is silver on an adapter that is black everywhere else but at least the ring is good quality and the threads are clean and precise Very High Quality and Excellent Fit,positive
These strings are the bomb I have used DAddarios since my earliest playing days Over the years I have experimented with several different brands and eventually found myself at home with Elixir Polyweb lights After having the frets on my guitar a Fender grand concert redressed I noticed it had been restrung with EXPs which I used eight years ago and loved Since they were on the guitar I decided to give them another try I am glad I did the tone is great They speak with a natural bright and lively voice that is sweet to the ears EXPs make my guitar sound like it should Individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth They blend together beautifully when paying chords They have more punch to them than Elixirs do and the coating doesnt fray after a year like Elixirs either DAddario EXP16s are probably the most musical strings I have ever used They respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking I was able to get eight months out of them before I noticed deterioration in tone I think I have found my strings and I dont see myself using anything else for a while Awesome strings,positive
Ive been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while but I was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings Ive been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller I was intrigued by the promise of long life though I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didnt sound at all like old strings This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when newId just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago so I decided that would be my reference The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D35 Both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding but Im pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars If they D35 sounded dull Id noticeAs I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled Light gauge they had a 0013 E string something youd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings The B was a 017 compared to the 016 of the DAddarios I usually play The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges Turns out that these are HD Light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end The difference shouldnt be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D35So how do they sound The unwound E and B dont sound different from any other plain steel string of course The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer when I switch between the D35 and the Gospel Soundwise Id say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day I wouldnt call them dull by any stretch of the imagination If I didnt know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldnt be able to tell from playing them So theyre good sounding strings and they last a long time That leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated stringsHeres the way I see it If youre a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not Youre probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before theyd go dull from corrosion or contamination But if youre a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run And if youre a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice For myself Im going to leave these on the D35 for as long as they still sound good Ill update this review when I find out just how long they do lastFollow up After playing these for a few days I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH350 an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars They sound great on the Loar and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on Long life and for some players a good economic choice too,positive
This bad boy rocks fits in guitar case it slices it dices it makes julienne fries Well no but it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and windunwind guitar strings thoughIf it had a flashlight tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect but engineers are mortal and I couldnt put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case at least not without coating it with butter firstIts plastic and steel it will break eventually as everything does imperfect world re 34breakfast club34 bolts fall out doors fall off but til then Ill enjoy using this The string winder is a little awkward I have a little fender brand gizmo that looks like a pez dispenser with a swivel head on top its small so I keep it in the guitar case along with this contraption winds strings much faster than this device but if youve got the time this one will work just fine I also wear two pairs of socks in case one gets a hole in it Im prone to redundanciesIt may be sheer rumor but I have it on good sources that this item is actually based on alien technology recovered at Roswell New Mexico Your chance to own alien technology at an affordable price not like those Iphones that they took out of the saucersIf it only came in mink it would be perfect Strange Contraption Combines 3 tools in one handy gadget,positive

I love these microphones I really do I also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice The 2 things I did not like was 1 the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it otherwise it does not sound as crisp 2 although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it wont screw in It is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an XLR Female so buy the correct wire when connecting to an ampspeaker For the price I really do recommend these as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centeredand close to your mouth Overall a great product Works Wonderfully Just Two Complaints,positive
A perfect fit Plus it comes with a handle strap and a nice sized pocket where you can store picks capos straps and strings Its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely Would recommend it Great purchase fits my uke perfect Great design,positive
Like many others here have pointed out this is a very good leather strap at a very good price and it is made in Canada It is a simple design but it is plenty long enough for a taller than average player is solidly made and did you notice how low the price isI have looked at leather straps for some time and could never pull the trigger on ordering one because of sticker shock on the price Most straps I have seen in guitar stores of this quality start in the 30 price category I just cannot justify spending 30 or 50 or more for an overpriced version of this same guitar strap which has some fancy brand name label on it and is of no better quality This strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap A nylon strap may work adequately but lacks any real sense of styleAlso most of the name brand straps are two inch or three inch wide and this 212 inch wide strap is just right for meI like this strap so much I am now placing an order for one in every colour I can find them in for use with my other guitars Great Strap Great Price,positive
I wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin These will work for soprano The J53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks They provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play Increases projection and tone to any stock strings Not the best not the worse strings but an improvement An improvement,positive
This little cable gets used on my practice amp I love the 90 degree connection The overall quality seems good and I have had no problems Great,positive
It makes restringing way easier its pretty stable and sturdy It will work on pretty much any guitar So far iv used it on my 67 electrics and my Taylor acoustic Cool deal,positive
I like that this is fairly light It works as expected and has not given me any problems I recommend this item Light Works well,positive
Got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar This is a great strap for the money They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast If you want to spend more money you can and get a little better leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones nicer but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value Great strap,positive
I wanted this for overall practice however the only 34clear and good34 sound will be the satriani effectif that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it cantstill use it for practice and wont change it its just hard to get a clean sound out of it hard to find a clean sound,neutral
Good tuners Can tune several different instruments Just be careful you have it set to the right instrument when you are tuning or you will go through a lot of strings I have several of these They are a great size and can be left on your instrument if you desire Personally I prefer the Snark tuner but these are a fairly close second Does the job,positive
A snug fit for the POD HD 500 Knocked one star off because the weight distribution is a little awkward when using the strap on my shoulder Perfect fit for the POD HD500,positive
I choose this rating cause it is the best Adapter Ive found I like that is doesnt heat up or even get warm although I only use it with my looper Another plus is the length of the cord is the best cause I dont need to use and extension cord with it One less thing to set up carry around and worry about I Truly recommend this One Spot Adapter to everyone One Spot Adapter,positive
I have a Martin HD28 with the large Grover tuners This string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectlyIf you change your strings regularly this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tunersFor 6 these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time Perfect for Grover tuners,positive
I play guitar bass and violinand more I have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay In fact that may be saying too much I was really surprised at the Snark SN5 tuner I found it very accurate I compared it to my Boss TU2 tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter I decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the Snark no one would ever do thisthis was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope I plan on buying the higher quality Snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter Very impressed with this If I can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board I will be happy These are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so I dont have to move it around as I change guitars during performances Snark SN5,positive
this mic is perfect it gets the job done sounds clear has settings on it clamps on your lap top this mic is perfect,positive
This is a good quality Capo The built is similar to the ones I see at the local music stores that sells between 9 14 I guess they are all made by the same company and then stamped with a logo by whoever is selling it This capo does not have any logo or stamp but it works just as good as the more expensive onesI ordered two of this item on 0318 Expected delivery is between April 11 18 as the product will be shipped from Hong Kong but I received the product on April 2ndI used it in Acoustic Guitar and on the Ukelele without any problem Good Quality Capo Arrived Earlier than expected,positive
I bought this on a whim I was pretty satisfied with the extra heavy picks I was using but wanted something with more grip These picks have a logo and the company name molded in which gives purchase to you pickin fingers to hold on to the pick This seems to be a perfect thickness for some of my guitars that have silk and steel strings With the xtra heavy picks I was losing what little treble these strings had With this little purple wonder I got my treble back and still had great control for playing fast or playing hardI like them so much I bought another hundred just in case the purple pick monster eats all my other picksIts a great pick its delrin or whateverdelflex generic name they give it to avoid trademark issues but its the best plastic for picks in my book The tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful I keep a couple of these in all my guitar casesI recommend these if you enjoy playing guitar or just enjoy owning things that are purple colored They dont taste like grapes however pickin and grinnin in purple,positive
Case arrived in great conditionQuite Roomy fits my Vendetta ANDOr my Les Paul Two exterior pockets for tools extras etc2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away Im not hauling them to showsGet One VERY Nice,positive
First of all its huge no like really hugeBut finally you get over that but seriously its hugeThe three presets are what sets this apart but this could have been so very much better whythe midi clock sync implementation is flawedA The midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them onoffB To have a midi in and not be able to midi syncquantize the looper sighlike really This means you cant play with a drum machine sampler sequencer or play with anyone that doesSo while this offers some functionality above the Flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays only one of which can be used at a time and can be used as a basic looper along with the delay defined by the knobs The downside is a very large footprintThereforeBUY if you have the space and either need the three presets or have neither a looper OR a delayCONSIDER PASSING if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision both are weak after the fact implementations Could be so much better,neutral
Small size easy to transport and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy but improving guitar playing p Simple small good value lots of fun,positive
This cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp I noticed how thin the cable is but the length is good for my needs I have played through the cable once and found it sub par compared to my other cables which are professional grade and cost a lot more but this is a cheap cable and sounds like any other cable of this caliber I use the right angle to hook up to my jazz bass during rehearsal where long cables at times bunch up and become cumbersome in a studio setting Cheap cable for the tuner out on my amp,neutral
I bought this guitar nearly a year ago It was my first guitar I never cared much for the sound It always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune I eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this Squier My skills are slowly improving but I wanted another electric so I sprang for a Epiphone Les Paul Yes its 3x more expensive than the Squier BulletStrat but it sounds 10x betterIf you buy a Squier I think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar Youll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etcOr just buy a better guitar to begin with At this price point you probably wont find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar A project guitar,neutral
Nice foot switch for the mustang amp Able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily Great quality Nice,positive
Strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around Fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice Good price Acoustic guitar just fits in,positive
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description I wasted my money Dont waste yours Perhaps viagra would be helpful Far Too flexible for use with a professional microphone,negative
Ive used the 60mm and 73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career I rock hard Acoustic electric and Bass Ive tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily Dunlops Nylon picks dont break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs youll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming Maybe 5 times in my entire career Buy these picks Best picks on Earth Flexible indestructable,positive
This had to be designed by someone who understood the need for wellplaced lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light just right over two open pages The battery operation is nice if you want to be portable but I have found that the AC adapter Mine came with the light check to be sure you get one with yours is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day My Duracell batteries ran down quickly over a few weeks before I noticed the light becoming slightly less and less The AC adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness The whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of I needed to buy an extension cord as the AC adapter cord is only about 6 feet long and while that sounds like a lot by the time you lay it out where you want it out of the way to avoid tripping you might need to add an extension cord too I understand the LEDs themselves last a long long time so that is good they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there All in all these do the job illuminating with a pleasant easy to readby light Perfect Light for viewing Sheet Music,positive
I used these on my ukuleles and they worked well enough that I bought tow more pairs They hold a regular strap well and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a Uke Leash google it those are fabulouscheers Ukulele,positive
if you have never recorded vocals with a pop filter you dont know what you are missing This one works well gets rid of a lot of the little sounds and all the pops only bad thing is when it doesnt stay in place but its usually fine a little rigid but it works well,positive
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way why cause thats what this bad boy or girl to be pc does It is instant ideas The thing that makes this so simple and effective is you can simply record a riff or melodytop part then create around it loop by loop or just one idea with another on top As simple as this sounds otherwise you would have to record a track then play over that taking time and killing inspiration in the processThere are others on the market to be sure I had the boss looper with 2 pedals and it was noisy on playback That was years ago and I couldnt get rid of it fast enough Ive used delay pedals my whole life and being a fan of shoegazedream pop I have always had a love of layered guitarsloops a la the church or the chameleons or chapterhouse lush house of love and stuffI looked on youtube and read reviews for a while before my purchase as I dont have money to waste This seemed to be the best choice for me The use of this live especially without the footswitch sold seperately would be tough to be sure There are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers The only one Ive seen that seems seamless is the boss one or roland one with like 5 pedals and is like 700 bucks maybe more There are demos of a guy looping himself with different instruments all running into it For the price it should be and is greatThis little wonder though is fantastic The price cant be beat and it doesnt suck up tone as some of the other ones do from what Ive read The thing I would say is its best for recording and to use as an audio notepad in a way You can use saved loops in songs but since they are already formed so its silly to start a song with 5 guitars in a dense dancemy last thought on this this is a secret come closercloser nowcome on I wont biteA VOLUME PEDAL that way you can layer with different adjusted levels and not bending down and fixing levels and such sounds simple but youll see I am going to look for a decent one dont you wannastart a fire,positive
I folds down to a very small size but is quite strong I have a dreadnaught resting on it now ready for use It should work very well with any size acoustic guitar Sitting by itself the stand is small enough to be out of the way but is able to hold my precious guitar securely when put to use When I get another guitar I will get another Fender stand to go with it Looks and works great,positive
This is a nifty little tuner Its accurate and is fast to turn yellow if youre off by even the slightest degree I just leave it on my telecaster Its a little deeper than I thought it would be it actually lifted the tele up a little when placed in the case But after a few weeks the foam conformed and the neck now rests on the case support The ratchet is a little gimmicky but once its set it can be easy slid off and on the headstockThis little tuner is made to be left on one guitar If you want one that you can move from instrument to instrument then get a Snark Low profile High quality,positive
I like the product i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost i thought that it could hold a few more picks I think i putted about 7 picks in it but hey it works and i would buy it againI forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar thats what i did it looks good and durableAlso Its Cheap Ok,neutral
I always lose my damn picks this helps Hopefully I dont lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there Good Pick Holder,positive
First real harmonica i have owned Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many The price is right and the quality seems good too Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and singledouble blowdraw Still trying to get the overblow I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on It has a good seal also Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back Special 20,positive
So the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it Ive used this in my jam lab for 4 years and use it every time I play electric about 57 hours a weekThe unit itself has held up well No problems with case or pedals All switches knobs plugs display work fine It doesnt have a onoff switch but thats minor Its low profile and is easy to switch by foot I have it going into my mixer which works fine No feedback or buzz from itI like the recording software Cubase that came with it I didnt think Id use it much but I do Its fun and easy to record my own songs Cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close but Ive learned nothing happens and its fineI dont use the looper much as I have it before my Digitech Jam Man Which if you dont have you need it The drum presets are fun to use Its a blast to set a drum track loop a rhythm then jam on top of it Isnt that what its all aboutMy two gripes are the tuner and clean presets The tuner is not very accurate and I use a cheapo tuner that works much better Also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isnt Some flaw I guess Also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak I dont like them at all The distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone They rock I use alot of the other ones as wellIMHO this the must have addition to your set up Its not for professional usebut when I turn pro Ill get something better 4 year reviewI still like italot,positive

I have my 12 string on this stand when Im taking a break from practicing as you know a case is where you should store your guitars not on a stand It is easy to assemble Youll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one if youre gigging I might suggest a higher priced stand but for occasional travel and home use this will do the trick Not a Bad Stand,positive
The picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well I have not had them very long but seem to do well picks,positive
I use this primarily when setting up guitar and measuring strings by locking down on 1st fret and taking measurements from there Fits all my guitars basses,positive
I purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar I had previously purchased a fabric capo for him to use until I could get him a better one That did not last long I ordered this one and he loves it Its durable and works perfectly Jim Dunlop 83 52553 Guitar Capo,positive
I bought mine used When I got it in it didnt work There was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board Behringer uses a custom power supply so I had no way of testing it I had to send it back for a refund I read other reviews that have had the same problem so it seems to be an occasional issueHowever Ive used one of these boards before The one I used back then was fantastic and everything I needed for small projects Iffy,neutral
This stand is very nice it is black and it does its job very well It also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand It is like an added bonus Great stand no problems,positive
I like the strings Ill be changing them soon though because they have a really light sound and I like the smooth low sound I like that these strings come with a code that allows you to determine whether they are authentic or counterfeit Will buy these again Good Strings,positive
The screws are too long for my very thin bodied Gibson SG Classic I can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work eitherthe heads are all too largeI believe I used these on my Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago and they worked perfectly Not on my newer SG thoughat least with the new screws it comes withFender Start appears to take the system wellonly time will tell Does NOT fit Gibson SG Fender Strat seems good,positive

I own both the H1 and H4n and I love them both The H4n is a great versatile field recorder I mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements The H4n is a work horse It has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats I highly recommend purchasing a furry head wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door useUnlike the H1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones the H4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications However be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped I had this happen once If this happens to you dont worry I searched the internet and was able to find several Zoom certified service centers within my general area I called the closest service center spoke with a repairman and shipped the H4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty I didnt pay a dime I had it shipped off and back in 7 daysAll in all the H4n is a great field recorder I mainly use it in 4 channel mode 4 Chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two XLR inputs at the same time In some cases I also use a small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer if I have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones Running straight from the mixer outputs to the H4n works perfectlyI do suggest some accessories when using the H4n As I said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen I use the furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise I only use 32gb Sandisk SD cards because Sandisk is dependable I have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording I record at 48K 16bits in wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate This allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case I forget to transfer the audio files along with video when I edit I also suggest having a DI box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone elses mixer I have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a DI Box from venue mixers This has to do with a balance and padding that I am just not going to get into but trust me a DI box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues I also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events Always be prepared I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries and I have never had any issues Battery life is between 68 hours when the unit is left on and 34 hours when left powered on and recordingI do not regret this purchase at all The H4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable I highly recommend purchasing one Great field recorder,positive
Im a guitar player and singer who works with a band and as a solo and as a duo with a bass player I found one of these used for half the retail price It had no microphone but I already have mics and I dont like wireless anyway and dont need one Besides who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit worksWell it was great I brought a small Behringer guitar amp in case I had to choose between guitar and vocals in terms of sound quality since the unit has onle one set of tone controls BIG surprise my Martin GPA sounded great through the PWMA230 and so did my vocals I didnt need anything else for a duo gig in a large and semiloud bar Volume was strong the sound was clear and full and the guitar and voice sounded as natural as could be Its light as a feather I have troubles with my knees and use a cane and it was no problem and it sounds great And since I play there once a week I left it at the gig and do not worry about theft or breakage since the unit is so inexpensive and replaceable even at the marketplace price I might give it 4 12 stars but I cant figure out how to get halfstars This is a godsend to one and two person acts who already have enough to carry With my ZT Club amp for my Telecaster for band gigs and the PWMA230 for acoustic gigs I have more room less to carry and less to worry aboutUpdate Oct 25thI think others have mentioned problems with PylePro Audios customer service I must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too I wrote to them praising their product and asked if for specs on the power cord and whether they sold an extra in case I lost the one that came with the unit and if they also sold a cover for it I wrote a least three times and got no response so far The website was no help and calling them directly was worse got the wrong dept was transferred to a dept which never picked up the phone I still love the PWMA230 but I am no fan of its manufacturerUpdate Oct 28To be fair someone did finally contact me today My questions were unanswered and I dont think my email was read very carefully but at least they did respond Ill update as to the answers and information provided Great Buy,positive
this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all 9 cymbals that I possess and use very brilliant and resonant definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price trust this cymbal once and you wont be disappointed it lasts a pretty long while too its a thin splash so it does tend to break after about 8 months of use er so but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there all in all I definitely recommend trying this product My Favorite Cymbal,positive

I bought two of these Small but well lighted screen Very quick reaction to string I liked it from the very first tuning It is quicker and more responsive than other tuners I have that cost twice the price It is small and doesnt look like a huge lump on the headstock Operates with one 3V 2032 Battery included I plan on buying a few more for other guitar cases and as gifts for my musician friends around birthdays and Xmas small price huge value,positive
Im not much for brand names on my guitar cases I figure it tells wouldbe thieves what theyre getting I sprayed a little matteblack paint over the Epiphone logo The case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush It fits my Line 6 JTV Variax in a very cozy way Great case for small cash Great budget case for Les Paul style guitars,positive
I bought this to replace my sons previous guitar that had broken from hard use From initial unboxing it is clear that this has been made to a much better standard The wood looks beautiful All the metal parts look sturdy and durableIt sounds good although as my son is a beginner I cannot judge just how goodNote that there is no guitar cableFor now I am very happy with this purchase as it looks better made than I expected good build quality,positive
I have been playing music for years and often I lose my picks during a performance I took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers Best pick ever Best pick i have ever used Ever,positive
I wouldnt consider this a 30 backup mic I would consider this a professional vocal mic Period This is a great mic Out of the box it has a nice weight to it It sounds slightly hotter than say a Shure SM58 which is why I like it so much I typically like to stand back from a mic when I sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique I have also tested this mic with harmonica as well Seriously I dont work for the company or have any ties whatsoever Im just a dude in a band Trust me on this one Perfect live vocal mic perfect price,positive
Im no audiophile but this thing is just as good as my BBE Green Screamer Its perfect and I would suggest getting one before the cost goes up Killer,positive
I was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what I was expecting The adjustable stand also works great and wont fall on you or anything I bought this and a micboom stand for my Samson SP01 Shockmount which the AudioTechnica condenser mic is on however its connecting slot is a 38in female while this stand has a 58in male same with the micboom stand So just make sure whatever it is youre buying can connect properly with the stand If not just buy a cheap about 6 adapter like I did A Good Purchase,positive

Ill keep this short and simple I do alot of radio work and saw the price of this mic of eBay I wanted to use Paypal and got it 60 bucks for something Id have easily have paid 100 for and with the included shockmount its a total steal This obviously wont match top quality condensers but for speech atleast I find it to have a wonderful crisp tone with a warm sound to compliment your voice It just has that smooth radio sound you hear on stations like NPR which I just love It sounds fantastic and with a proper interface possibly the best condenser Ive tested thats under 150 bucks Excellent Condenser for an excellent price,positive
As the title says it works The only reason I took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and I have to use some force to get it off the XLR But no issues besides that It works,positive
I brought this for my husband drum set He loves it It is made very nice I34am happy Nice,positive
This assembled in just a couple of minutes without the need to refer to the instructions The bench is comfortably padded and very affordable Very comfortable easy to assemble,positive
I had put these on and my wife picked my guitar to play and she was confusedThey do take some time getting used to They dont rip up your hand as much and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift there is less friction This is good but it takes some getting used to I used that fingertip friction to let me know where I was on the fretboard With these I found myself overshifting both high and lowI like them and they sound nice but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes Interesting strings,positive
I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago Recently I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp After tracing the issue I discovered there was some play in the Strats jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip A quick fix was to bend the jacks connector end but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open making a minor gap where there wasnt that positive connectionIve purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work Stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials Its a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection Obviously because the finish is chromed oxidation can get in the way of the connection but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied If oxidationwear is an issue Switchcraft makes goldplated jacks However I just love these jacks and for the price they really cant be beat Best jack great replacement for MIM Fender,positive
This is such a nice bag for the price Nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever There is a handle and a shoulder strap Plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front Couldnt Ask for More,positive
Considering the price is so cheap on these I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio To say that I used it rarely is an understatement maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges That said within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would the volume ALL the way upAside from it not working less than a year later as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well However if youre building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice its a decent little mixer while it worksPass on this sound quality is decent for the price but reliability gets a zero Dead after less than a year,negative
These were purchased for my sons guitar He loves them I plan on buying him another set of them for Christmas Perfect,positive
This is perfect for our digital piano We love it Easy assembly I would recommend this to anyone piano bench,positive
I dont know why others rated it as a 4 star It is exactly what it says it is and works fine Perfect for Loar Mandolin,positive
They work great theyre quiet and theyre cheap What else can you ask for Im very happy with the product Work great quiet and cheap,positive
I like Behringer pedals so I may be bias but this pedal really adds to my sound I really helps with pick up Good back ground,positive
I put these on my Dlx Players Strat but it wasnt a piece of cake First problem no instructions came with the package Found a method done by another searching online Served as a guide Second after removing the old Fender Tuners I noticed the new tuners didnt fit into the slots This meant drilling out the holes by another 18 of an inch Blue tape both sides as to prevent marring Third the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock There are also with two dimples I used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement Then carefully drilled two holes per tuner Take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock These rest was simple Install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze If you are not mechanically inclined then I strongly suggest you go to a Luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job For the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions No instructions your on your own,neutral
I only do test recording with this digitally to get a better Idea of my learning process from the other side It gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw I have Good quality as you would expect from Shure,positive
This is a great value for a practice and travel instrumentI got mine with free shippingBuilt like an instrument not a toy it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele Fun to play easy to take along stays in tune well enough and its only a hundred bucks I bet if you bought one you would like it Fun a loud,positive
I replaced a set of strings that were very used with these Martins They are as named very light They are easy on my fingers and give great tone Quality company great strings great price My fingers love these,positive
the mini amp did not arrive with the battery as it was stated in literature good thing I had purchased the 9volt power adapter I was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether would purchase again mini amp,positive
I have an electronic indooroutdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifierIt is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometerThe whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier Makes the whole house safer for the MartinsNow you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor systemA sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too Just dont get water on the woodAnd dont forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the caseAll the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms OK,neutral
I play bass with these and they have a unique tone The scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music Makes Rotosound strings really sound off I have not found that they are so hard on strings that the strings were out from use rather than the picks It does take a bit of use to get good with them but it is worth it for when you need that really growling tone Killer picks,positive
I have both the Fender GDec 15 and the 30 and the Line 6 Spider Jam just blows them awayThe controls are much more intuitive than the GDec line like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so I could hear my guitar over it and I was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks or drum beats I wanted and the only time I had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easyI only mention these capabilities to compare with the Fender lineOnce you go further into the amp and get into the dubbingrecording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedalThe amp can get really loud and I dont see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side showSince I have only had the amp for a short time I cant say anything about how it will holdup but I have 8 other amps by different companies and the quality is just fineBy the way I have a GDec 30 for saleAddendumThe following is my take between the Jam and the 4 series do with it as you wishA modeling amp will literally model existing Amps Artists and Songs from different yearsThe Spider 4 does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider JamIf you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then the 4 isyour ampIf you need a practice amp go with the JamI have both amps and as far as I am concerned the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engineWhile the Spider 4 I have the 150 is a nice amp it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexibleI do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as I used the Jam for a longtime without and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there socalled on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation Much better than the GDecs and the Spider 4 series,positive
These strings are very bright and full They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead I havent had any problems with breakage just a loss of tone over time seems faster than some other strings Ive tried Sound great but dont last long,positive
When I first got this it blew up my headphones and didnt work right at all with my desktop speakers or anything I am now glad to say that after getting a replacement headphones and desktop speakers that this thing works fantastic It is a small design amplifier and does its job very well I now have my good headphones my noise canceling headphones and my desktop speakers hooked up to it and they all work fantastic No more unplugging and plugging in the desktop speakers and headphones from the back of the computer which was such a hassle everytime Now all I gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah I have to say it works very well for the price The only thing I dont recommend doing is turning the volume past the 2nd notch for your good headphones because they might damage them like they did mine Anyways I would recommend this if you hate unplugging and plugging stuff in all the time and you want some more bass Fantastic little device,positive
When I first started setting up my little studio I wanted something that didnt break the budget I tried a couple different combo pedal boards Digitech 500 Boss ME70 but quickly realized I wasnt getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up With not much left I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro Who would think This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds as are most of this line of pedals I now own about 1214 of these of all types and have never been dissapointed save its very hard to chain them without a lot of noiseThen I got into guitar building and they all got put away Lately I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills and joy of joys I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love themForget the FAB series they are not so hot Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo You will NOT be sorry These old time food pedals are the best,positive
This pick is so good to play electric guitar It is heavy and small what gave us attack Make the sound clean and bright So good,positive
I use this mostly with my Honeytone mini amplifier and Reel Echo tape echo simulator Works very well with no problems A lot of Danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to Ac voltage outlets Great for any Danlectro product,positive
I dont know a lot about guitars and strings I bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there Sunday nice,positive
As I mentioned in the title this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks Enough said It does its job and does it ok for my taste Simple and holds picks Enough said,positive
Works great and easy to use It also seems to be very accurate Definitely worth the money Should also work for any stringed instrument Great,positive
I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits Well it fits but just barely The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around facing down to close the case I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position I probably wouldnt store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz Id worry about tension on the strings Otherwise I like it Fits my Dot with Bigsby just barely,positive
Does the job well enough Good tool,neutral
Delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a Fender product Great instrument cable,positive
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didnt even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and rightnever again I got burned,negative
This fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up The fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy Its ok but not the best fog machine out there Its OK,neutral
When I ordered these I wasnt expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10foot cable It turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all I plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static interference or buzz to explain the low price and all I got was a nice clean signal Highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable Excellent Insert Cable,positive
Not much to say other than its a good cable Good solid connections with no play After consistent use its going strong Good cable,positive
These are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work Im using them in our drum room one is on hihat and one is on a small cymbal They have a smooth unhyped soundThe mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box I have used them in an XY overhead position and they sounded quite good and very naturalSome of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of 1200 each so I am aware of what 34expensive34 microphones sound like these perform 34up there34 with the expensive mice while being bargain pricedGood music to all Bargain pair of microphones,positive
I have yet to find a pedal that can match this little guys desired effect If you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect Really Good for the Money,positive
The GoodThis is a good tool to practice guitar with headphonesThe BadThe tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination unless you like hyperdistorted noise The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied The effects are hit and miss as well Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that its downright offensiveThrow in the fact it chews through batteries the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use and how it loses its smallandportablefactor with a guitar cable headphone cable and power adapter plugged into it Id be hardpressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones Ok for practice,negative
I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet Construction features too well soldered TRS 1434 male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain reliefbut nothing major and the cables work fine none the less Great product great price,positive
Monster Standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price Its flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable Its much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables For the money its really hard to beat I wont waste money on the more expensive cables again Inexpensive and excellent,positive
I have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners The Snark SN1 is by far the best It is acurate and picks up the vibration of the low A and E strings without a problem The Best Tuner,positive
This was very easy to put together Top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable Love it Easy Assembly,positive
Really cool looking and are nice picks for the The eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick Great deal from amazon thanks I will definitely buy more of these in the future Clayton Friday the 13th Picks 6pack,positive
Great for the price Not for guitars with nitro finish But I cut up a tshirt into several long strips and wrapped them around the padding and then tied it nice and tight The result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars Does the trick,positive
I honestly dont see the purpose It doesnt seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar Ive used it a few times but dont see the benefitEdit 53013After coming back to read the other reviews its obvious what happened This was shipped to me completely dry There was no greaselubricant qualities It was like a dry erase pad They need to improve their quality control Im changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packagingI would suggest if you receive this product and it hasnt dried out yet to place this product in a airtight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out It seems pretty unnecessary,negative
WOW I got more than I expected from this Chromatic Tuner Sure its a plastic case but who would be rough on a pedal anyways had it about 3 weeks now and im impressed I see people say the blue indicator light is too bright but truthfully its OK because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough if it is too bright for you just put a little piece of black tape over the light but like i said its OK cause you can still see the tuner lights I use this pedal with theVisual Sound One Spot Combo Pack works like a charm Great pedal,positive
Ive used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count Its hard to find a tough low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere but this one is the best one out there for the price paid Its made well with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love I use it for all of my equipment connections and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect Try it out youll discover the same as me and my band mates have that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon The best cheap cord on Amazon Period,positive
This speaker has a very clear full range sound I have it in a 63 Brown Deluxe and am very good with it In a way it reminds me a bit of a JBL with the smooth depth and clarity If I want a little Ray Charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack Cool speaker and nice addition EMINENCE CANNABISREX 12Inch LeadRhythm Guitar Speakers,positive
These are one of the best strings Ive used Im a blues guitarist so they take a beating well Very much worth the cost and I thank Amazon for having them Great,positive
Up date from February 08 2011 Wow look at all of Them that did Not find My review helpful I should have up dated much soonerNot that I care because I tell the truth and do good to please Myself Not a bunch of fools The first time I turned It on It was exactly the Sound I was looking for Shimmer and Space verbOkay I Am apologizing for ordering the last one I guess I take the easiest way of ordering but If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems but If You look on some search there are some still left Behringer needs to look at what The Customers Is buying and make more of them If Your buying this Reverb Machine then You must be wanting It for Its Ducking also called Shimmer and Space verb If Not then there are cheaper Reverbs as Danelectro as FAB Echo which Is a nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound and there Is the more expensive Line 6 Verbzilla and Someone wrote Me and said Boss has or did have this effect there are Internet videos showing this effect My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It has Ducking Shimmer which Digitech calls String Swell which Is a Violin type Sound and They call Space verb Giga verb and I made the mistake of buying the Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String or Volume Swell was Shimmer then If found what I was looking for on Internet video I hope I had already Wrote some Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 and started having dreams about having this Sound effect again and just had to have ItHow well this Behringer RV600 performs and Sounds I have Not received It yet to know but If possible I will do an up date but I have a Behringer EP2500 Power Amplifier that still works good which I even used as part of a Rife Doug coil machine but the EP4000 would be better for that use Also the fan runs all the time Still Some More Left,positive
I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps but these are great they are all plenty tough and if I find myself with my Straplokd strap its nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch An essential mod,positive
Ive been using these picks for 10 years theyve always been great Between these blues and the yellow Im covered Picks,positive
Well this cable certainly didnt last long as the title says 8 weeks Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago Last night amp would turn on but wasnt putting out any sound from the guitar Messed around a bit and it started to work Today same thing and its obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasnt very happy Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a 12 cordMaybe Im just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store Id return it Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund Will just move on to another companys cord After 8 weeks the cable quit working,negative
This was exactly what I was expecting Seems to be better quality than other cheaper products I researched Id definitely recommend paying the little bit of extra money for a better quality Fender product like this over other generic output jacks Great Product,positive
While I wish the bases came in different colors I really like these hangars They look good and perform well I hang Strats on them and have not experienced any problems think I saw a video on Youtube that said Strat headstocks could slipEasy to install and hanging and releasing is a nobrainer Have three of these Hercules hangers Love this product,positive
This stuff works great and is well worth the price I used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals no more scratchiness no more jarring volume spikes all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new Ill always keep a can of this around nothing more to say great stuff Just what I needed,positive
Using this to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet It is holding a Shure SM57 microphone The microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic but Im using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads Solid,positive
Back in the 1980s I bought a can of deoxitnot the right name but cant remember it which worked much better and cost much less It was made for the military The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better I dont see much else out there so I may have to stick with itIt is just very wasteful for the cost I have had good luck with wd40 too but it is very flammable I would call it average There used to be better stuff,neutral
These work great keep the guitar case around 43 degrees but do not seem to last as long as they did in the past They are easy to use I continue to buy them because I live in a dry region of the country Humidipak,positive
Its a cool pedal especially considering its price but dont be fooled All this pedal does is perform volume swells Any other sound you are able to create with this pedal you wouldnt JUST be using this pedal Think of it as a supplumentary effect If you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal you need to use it in combination with other effects Reverse delay wah distortion etcIts convenient too if you are playing and you want use volume swells but you also want to use other effects like wah whammy something else that requires the attention of your feet If you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells I would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it Pure convenienceIt has its quirks though If you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain To the point where its nonexistent But the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly If sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck the rest will just play as if the effect was offOther than that its built well doesnt add any hiss no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min The battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure power adapters are your friendIts cheap its convenient But i wouldnt recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry Oh that reminds me the casing is plastic Automatic Volume Swells,neutral
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because its unpleasant to use hurts the fingers Its cheap and easy to use Itll do the job but I dont like it Its OK but I wish Id bought something else,negative
It is lighter than most fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy 1534 speakersThe material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging 46 times a week Good enough for the job,positive
Inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners Angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well Great bang for the buck,positive
I initially had a black colored one because I thought that would be more 34cool34 But I lost it So now I get brighter colored ones Gripe a rubber thingy on the bottom of the clip came off while performing and I have not been able to find it It still works but thats a design flaw Also dont leave it attached to any fine guitar because it like capos can permanently damage the finish of a really fine guitar but it works well and the batteries seem to last Really good tuner,positive
My rhythm guitar player recently dropped and broke his SG because of no strap locks I bought him a set of these I use them because unless you standardize you need a separate strap for every set of locks This eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair A great invention,positive
Ive bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags Sturdy stable and reliable Not a big fan of Fender accessories but they got this one right Gotta have these,positive
This pickup is actually a really great product for what it is I hooked it up to my acoustic and plugged it into my line 6 amp and shredded a little bitIts NUTS being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic WOW,positive
After trying out a few other styles and brands I settled on this stand wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall The overall design of the stand is great but I had to return my first stand as there were severe quality issues with the finish There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didnt stick to the metal and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right once it was clamped down to the main stand body Disappointingly the replacement unit I received also has this issue but only about 710 degrees worth Im going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish and truly worthy of my guitar Decent Stand For The Price Quality Could be MUCH Better,neutral
These have it all Sound great play great feel great tune great I am now dedicated to these strings It takes about 4 or 5 days before the strings are fully stretched and holding onto its tuning Once it does its beautiful music after that YES,positive
Good strings though in 1 use I didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard Diaddario phosphor bronze strings GOOD though perhaps not superior,positive
This is basically the same as the other stand I rated just from a different manufacturer Same basic materials you cant go wrong with either See my other review for the World Tour GS1 Folding Tripod Guitar Stand Honestly I cant tell them apart since I threw out the boxes great guitar stand for the price,positive
I was originally was about to purchase a cheaper thinner cable but settled on this Planet Waves Classic series XLR cable I wanted myMXL 2010 Multipattern Studio Micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it I also have my microphone and this cable connected to theYamaha Audiogram 6 audio interfaceand it works flawlessly Sturdy cable IT is thick and flexible at the same time It curls around my microphone stand well too Good connector heads At the female end microphone there is spring part that locks in the microphone in NIce added peace of mindThis cable simply feels strong and well made Phantom power and data transfer has been flawless I highly recommend this quality XLR cableUpdate 121912Still working great after 5 months Forgot to mention the nice packaging Its eco friendly and nicely packaged It also has a lifetime GUARANTEE Not a warranty a guarantee That speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product Quality XLR cable at a great price sturdy cable with quality heads,positive
This tuner works great I put in a 9 volt battery a couple of months ago and it still is going strong It will take a 9 volt output from my power supply and I can then piggyback to another pedal which is great It is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions You do need to hit only one string at a time however Size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable Price is very good I had a Boss in the past but took it back because it just seemed so overpriced and too complicated A great tuner and a great buy,positive
I bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele I am having a hard time using the picks on my uke I guess I dont like the way the uke sounds when using them It sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiffBut I am sure other people may disagree As far as the quality and vendor delivery I am happy and I have no complaintsI use the picks occasionally Yes I would recommend them to other uke players I would like to let people know they are very stiff I guess I thought being felt they wouldnt be so stiff But I am new to playing an instrument and I guess I just dont have much knowledge about picks Ukulele Picks,neutral
Ive always used Planet Waves nails but I wanted to try the Dunlop buying me this little package A very good experience Durable comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily Great price and good texture,positive
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic would need a heavier base for use with a boom good enough for my purpose,positive
Good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones If I want better I would shop around and pay more Does the job for now No complaints,positive
Holds 810 picks depending on thickness I stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by Does what it should,positive
Unless you have a taste for really thin picks this material and thickness will suffice for all uses both singleline leads and strumming This pick finally got me away from my old favorite Fender tortoise mediums though I do still keep them around Fabulous for all uses,positive
In a fit of boredom or curiosity I decided that I would check out some the other picks out there After spending too much money for various brands of picks including every model of the DAVA picks I came back home to Dunlop Tortex green They stil play great sound great against steel strings and last a long time Still the best,positive
What an amazing product Multivoltage capability for worldwide use powering eight pedals and very cost effective too If I bought eight adapters it would cost me well over 120 USD Even at the price its sold at the build quality is pro level Id be happy using this on a welltraveled pedalboard At this price you could buy two or three of these packs to power huge boardsI usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session Not all at once but its nice to know that the delivery is smooth without any drops or spikes in power level I can crank em all if I want to and go NUTS Awesome power,positive
I love my laptop a Thinkpad T40 It does almost everything I need almost A MONO mic jack no other inputs The Behringer U Control gives me STEREO now The Behringer reputation pulls through once again Ive tried some USB sound cards without success This product puts my older laptop besides newer ones Well done Behringer Stereo into Mono laptop At Last,positive

I just put it on my Baby Taylor guitar strap Nice Does the job and does it well Comes in a guitar shaped package that clearly shows how to install it in seconds if you are a newbie Glad I got this one It is exactly what I was hoping it would be Great,positive
This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them I love their flexibility options for colors and ends build quality and price I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I dont need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do Great quality cable,positive
If youre into playing blues these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage they allow you to bend the strigs easier Im not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment but Id use these anywhere Great for playing blues,positive
These pedals are great A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals arent manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them I have increased my speed a lot since Ive gotten em and I can pedal songs like All Nightmare Long and Beast and the Harlot now great pedals BUT it takes time to develop speed so dont think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you cant go all Jason Costa on em Very Pleasing,positive
I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes I used daddarios for many years I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable they sound great too The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating These have become my go to acoustic guitar string,positive
Strings theyre all I use on my acoustic These custom light strings in particular give me the sound I wanted from my guitar Love these,positive
What a great price and product Bought two of these so I can keep my guitars handy and I love them Really love having the rubber strap to secure the neck in the event of a mishap The wide frame legs make the stand extremely sturdy and love that it can come apart easy if I want to pack it up A must have,positive
While I have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting After using the Zoom H4N for a few weeks Ive found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcasters arsenal of gearI mainly use the H4N to record my podcasts using a Allen Heath ZED14 mixing board I usually do a two person podcast where I am in one location and the other person is brought in via Skype Using the Aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the H4N I can record myself in one channel the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my iPad into its own stereo channel This makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own trackThe sound quality of the H4N is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit You can hook up either two XLR microphones or two 1434 jack sources or a combination to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1834 input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source Its the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracksThe H4N will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well which could be useful if youre looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feedOverall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments Five stars without a doubt A Podcasters Dream Tool,positive
Theres another brand out there that is almost identical in construction and quality and costs less Dont buy the high rated chrome capped ones I had problems with those This one is good just that I regret paying so much for it Great cord but overpriced,positive
I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy These picks keep a nice bright tone very little friction on the strings so low string noise Enough grip to stay put in hands well too Good picks,positive
I ordered two of these based on the review and indeed this guitar strap deserves 5 starsIt feel like leather but I am not 100 it is true leather However at 10 a piece I have to give it 5 starsI used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily This one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigsI will order two more I have 4 different kind of guitars acoustic classical electric and bass it fit all of them great guitar strapand inexpensive too,positive
The surprise here is how they traded a little bit of diameter the Fatso part for incredible flexibility the other Fpart Looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss A really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords As good as instrument cables get,positive
Hands down the best cable I have ever owned I was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now I spend that money on other stuff I play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for 3 or 4 months Well worth the money Lifetime guarantee to boot Definitely will buy Mogami from now on The Best,positive
For the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build It matches my Epiphone Sheraton II well although it doesnt 34twist34 easily my neck strap pin is on the backside of the guitar Good looking and comfortable strap for the price,positive
Im not a string nazi and will play pretty much any major brand of strings with few exceptions DAddarios are good quality and combined with Amazon Prime a no brainer bargain under 3 per set delivered Unless you just dont like DAddario I would recommend these strings highly good quality strings,positive
I use it with an Audio Technica 2020 it work very well the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording Not much else to say Great Pop filter,positive
it barely did anything but i guess thats because im the one playing the guitar if you were in another room im am sure that it would make a difference pretty cool,neutral
Anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that I am not fond of the Snark displays I prefer the needle type because its symmetric above and below center while the Snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp However thats me and YMMV as they say on the InternetDont ask then why I got a SN6 I dont smoke drink or womanize the unit is cheap the moneys got to go somewhere and I like to play with accessoriesI am fond of saying that it doesnt matter which type of tuner you use because theyve pretty much become a commodity They all tune well with the same accuracy so it comes down to looks and priceWell thats not quite true Some models suffer fits in certain situations The rapid fall of the old Intellitouch was in my mind not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low E string on a Martin dreadnought A web search will reveal countless workarounds I and the rest of the world apparently buy a tuner to tune not work aroundLately Ive become enamored of theKala KAUBASSFS Solid Mahogany UBASS Fretted If you want a tuning challenge the low bass E string is it The SN6 hardly hiccups Other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing Not the SN6 Thats 5 stars in my book The only uke tuner worth owning,positive
Great for linking closequarter effect pedals No noise and very durable Great product for the price I would recommend buying Great Wires,positive
My only gripe is that once in a while after its been on for a long time it seems to drop out stop working in windows 7 Ive tinkered with my usb powersave settings etc and it still seems to be an issue Not that big of a deal as it doesnt do it when actively being used but about once every other day I have to unplug the USB and reconnect it Could be my system could be the preamp otherwise no complaintsThough be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software I dont even know what is on the software but I think its a full version behind what youll find on the website So far so good,positive
Ive played the guitar for a number of years some of them professionally and during that time Ive owned guitars by Fender Gibson Ovation BC Rich Yamaha and Applause That said admittedly this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap expendable guitar that was reasonably playable that I could take with me when I go camping While my expectations werent all that high due to guitars price upon reading other reviews and having experienced Takamines quality I decided to gave this Jasmine a try Im glad I did what a nice guitar it turned out to be Out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive The neck action was nicely set up the intonation is spoton and the guitar has a rich sound and tone The tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely Note that I changed strings from the set provided to a set of extralight gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price Impressive guitar for the price,positive
Best Ukulele strings I have found to date And Ive been playing stringed instruments and ukus for quite a while now I like em These strings are really nice,positive
Since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because Im a beginner and dont have much Calais yet Also I like the first day of new strings look Shiny I would recommend this to any beginner Easier,positive
These cables seem to be better quality than Nady or some other cheap brands Ive seen They work great for me Ill wait and see how they hold up in the log run Fingers crossedI havent had any problems with them at all so far Quality Cables,positive
This is a great microphone It fits easily into all the recording equipment Im using It has some heft to it so I know its not going to fall apart and be some wimpy microphone It gives me great sounds Great Microphone,positive
These strings retain a good feeling for a long time well past the point of them needing changed because theyve lost brightness These strings retain a good feeling for a long time,positive
Put this on a Gibson J45 It did increase the bass OK as thats not a J45s strength but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have Also took off a little of the finish on the soundhole when I removed it Tried it on a Martin D28 Nope The bass got muddier which is definitely the wrong way to go with a Martin At this point was going to return it but finally tried it on a small body Now THIS worked GREAT Louder focused and projects much better almost resonatorlike Fantastic for slide or capod high Thats its home nowSoAn OPort can help a guitar that needs help a small body or cheap guitar In my sample of 2 it made highend guitars sound worse If you cant afford a better guitar may be worth a try But be careful as it did chip off some finish on at soundhole OK for small or cheap guitars Not good for highend guitars,neutral
This came today and I must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly My Takamine acousticelectric fits perfectly and is VERY STABLE on the stand I have 100 confidence this will NEVER tip over on its own Youd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over Anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shillThis is built like a tank and should last a lifetime It is adjustable the neck fully padded and the twoarm base piece swivels for a custom fit The stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport A Wow,positive
This is really a no frills stand except the addition of a neck guard strap which is a nice touch It is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable Theres really not a lot more to say about it except that at 795 i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed I would certainly not spend 20 or 30 dollars on a stand when i could buy one of these Great stand for a great price,positive
Love joyo pedals Not sure yet on the new line They just dont feel as solid to me That being said the pedal sounds great great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch time will tell probably worth the price,positive
This was a bit hard to install over or under the strings We tried both Over the strings it would slide below the nut which isnt good Under the strings and it muffled a few So we kind of WOVE it above some and under others Other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems And it puts the name 34Martin34 on the lowliest box guitar In hindsight Id have probably just got a strap button and mounted it to the base of the neck But if you dont want to do that and hate the 34lace34 approach this will do the trick It may even fit better on different guitars ours is a 50 yearold Norma that actually sound AMAZING considering its origins guess old wood just SOUNDS better And the price is VERY right to be able to claim you own 34A34 Martin lol Better than laces,positive
this amp really shines in the distortion modes I dont really care for the clean sounds but the metal tones are as good as Ive ever heard out of a low cost amp I wish I had found this amp sooner It blows the other brands away get rock metal tones,positive
Not a whole lot to say about it Quality materials Works well Love to keep my Taylor on it but had to recase the guitar during our low humidity days Good and cheap Does the job well,positive
I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile but the selection of lengths is limited I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to redo the board I swear I was done in 20 minutes The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a smalltip flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables I wish I had bought these first,positive
Liked this capo it worked fine You can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension Good Capo,positive
This little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work It folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases The rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table It may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if youre not careful Sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the 10 on Works well folds neatly,positive
One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hihat stands I use anOn Stage Microphone 13inch Gooseneckto connect to the bar then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone The bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic modelThis also works well for mounting on microphone stands I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones or a DM80 for baritones Again it works perfectly for my situationsI always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands Its one more tool to make set up less stressfulTrust me when you need one and chances are you will if youre a drummer or a sound tech you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations I cited above and those that I have not foreseen Highly useful especially for drummers and saxophonists,positive
As an acoustic guitar player I think this is a great productI had previously been using the Korg GA1 which is a fine basic tuner The GA1 works like many basic guitar tuners where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning or with one two or three flats But the TM40 works by just showing the pitch youre currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches making alternate tunings and open tunings much simplerNow I use the TM40 at home as my main tuner and the GA1 rides around in my case Both great products Phenomenal value for the price,positive
Always good to have a stationary MIc on the floor Sometimes it is weet nestled in a drum set or for a singer that might not want to play any instrument but just wants to stand tall went together perfectly and I really wanted itShipping was fast and no problems thanks Die cast,positive
I bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my Macbook for Garageband You have to go in and change the input and output in OSX but it works great Works great with Mac and Garageband,positive
I think these jazz picks are awesome nice and light with a gripped texture so you dont have worry about them flying when you solo I only wish that more came in a single pack Great Picks,positive
I was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all I expected I use it for practice and recording myself I really like it but for the price I wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect I have it on my 1994 Martin D18 which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine I have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good very good,positive
It works very well installs easily stays in place once installed but can be removed easily Does not scratch guitars finish just be careful and no issues It will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar but it comes very close A great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric Works Very Well,positive
Very very good tune result It really put yout guitar in tune But the arm is so fragile It has broken 2 monthes after the purchase so i had to repair it manually with glue I recommend 4 stars because the arm broke,positive
I had purchased a different strap for my Fstyle mandolin and it was adequate but when I learned of this Neotech strap and how adjustable it was I ordered it and tossed my earlier strap This should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well My only complaint is that the button hole doesnt stay on the end pin of my Epiphone mandolin I solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick I wasnt happy with drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the endpin of the mandolin and the strap hasnt fallen off since over 2 months of daily playing The adjustments this strap offer are great,positive
This is an excellent product Ive used one of these before and dont remember it having lock washers this does When you tighten this down it actually stays tightenedFor 10 you cannot go wrong with this Bear in mind that its for a standard 10 hole diatonic harmonica not the 16 hole chromatic style Great Product Highly Recommend,positive
WOW this thing is fun to play withthis is my first delay pedal so i cant compare it with others but im so happy that i bought it ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day you can tweak the echo in 100s of different waysthe case seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last quite a while as long as i dont get over zelous and stomp on it too hard im very happy with this product and im becoming a real fan of behringer products digital delay pedal,positive
These are a musthave item Heretofore Ive been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism While its an innovative system that doesnt require any installation the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of thingsI installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit not a big deal at all These Schallers are exactly what I wanted 5 stars and a nobrainer So glad I listened to recommendations for this product,positive
Im not a professional but have been playing for many many years This is the best cord Ive ever had though Im sure Eric Clapton has something better excellent,positive
I bought this strap for my Luna 12 string The strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what I needed Great strap,positive
We have an old acoustic around the house but I rarely play it opting instead for the electric This is going to be hard to believe but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades agoWhen we put these new strings on the guitar Lotus the sound as you might imagine was incrediblebright and clearThese are fairly pricey but I am very impressed with the quality Excellent Strings,positive
I installed this in a Super Champ x2 As others have pointed out youll have to turn the treble down after installing it Thats because its designed for making solos stand out Ie for adding punch If youre a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar singHowever if you mostly play rhythm Id stick with the stock speakerI want to put two of these into my 4x10 Blues DeVille to increase its range and make solos sing while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom Used in a Super Champ x2,positive
There arent enough uke straps out there for a good price This one is great I take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller lighter Good product good price,positive
Ive been buying Dunlop pick for at least 15 years now and I love the feel and the grip The picks last for a really long time and I would recommend getting several thickness for different applications But for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick Great picks that work great on both acoustic and electric guitars,positive
Originally received the wrong item but I contacted customer service and they returned my email that night on a Sunday and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning I received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks Great customer service and love the picsthe color in the pictures doesnt do it justice Great customer service,positive
i mean if you just want something to learn the violin on then this is pretty good stays in tune and is reinforced in all the weak spots because cracks will form its okay,positive
I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings I put these on and what a difference These arent too heavy not too light They ring nicely I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings Made my cheap mandolin sound less cheap,positive
My favorite string from back in the 60s when I had my own guitar shop Great strings and the best packaging Used DAddario for Years,positive
There are something special about these strings They ring so bright and beautiful I absolutely love them for my fenders I honestly dont use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele Theyre gorgeous sounding especially when new Ive been using these since 1980,positive
Im using this with five pedals and it works great No added noise no signal loss and saves the cost and hassle of constantly replacing 9V batteriesComes with a nice assortment of adapters for use with just about any brand of pedal out thereprobably not the most durable power supply available but for the price it cant be beat Great value,positive
they work well For me the instalition wasnt that hard it took me maybe four or five minutes The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beasts stock strap system BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap or wax i used the bar soap though the installation becomes easierOnce you put your strap in its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system lolIf you need to clean your guitar strap take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it Nice locks,positive
Just a great strap A straight up product well worth the money Man its good to buy something from someone who puts their name labor and product on the line Then delivers Here it isyou want it come get it Cant miss dealing like that Thank you Levys Quality,positive
this tuner is awesome and accurate very noticeable and what else can i say for the price best deal ever get it ps i use it for my base though satisfied thanks Korg excellent,positive
It works well with several different instruments that I have Makes tuning a lot easier and accurate It is a good value Great Tuner,positive
Great strings Used them for years always loved them Put them on an Eric Johnson strat Wouldnt use anything low quality for that guitar Excellent Strings,positive
Cheap Easy Durable these things are worth the small price I have one for each guitar and just leave them on Snark Rules,positive
This is my 3rd VOX Amplug I have purchased through Amazon They are all awesome in thier own way The Satriani Amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb Without the effects on it is similar to the Lead plug with much lighter distortion still has nice crunch to it though If you are a Satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining If you could only buy just one this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play I love metal rock classic rock etcThe first song I played through this plug was The Star Spangled Banner ala Jimmi Hendrix and wow the Satch effects just make it sound amazing The Top Gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as wellIf you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the Metal Amplug it rocks your face offI LOVE MINE The AC30 Amplug is real nice for classic rock and country it is nice and clean but can go into ACDC tones very versatile AmplugThe Satch Amplug is a welcome addition to my collectionI would tell you to buy it and if I lost mine I would replace it immediately Same with the Metal Amplug If I lost my AC30 Amplug I would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another as versatile as it is I dont play enough classic rock or country as I do metal VOX Satriani amplug,positive
First let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still lookssounds as great as the day it came out of the boxIts a Boss product which means you are going to pay for what you get You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products Solid rugged construction that is built to last no chance of breaking one of these things and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal resale prices are always goodWhile this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion Here are some of the best uses I have found1 Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full2 Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve3 Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesnt matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing you will always find a use for it so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rigIn addition you have some great features easy access battery compartment accepts a 9v power supply works well with both guitar and bass 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired and all the controls you need to really be in complete control You HAVE to get this pedal Youll never buy another chorus pedal,positive
I personally think this Seagull is over rated A lot of reviewers are covering the muddy not crisp sound as 34mellow34I dont think so I have over 115 guitars in my collection and around 15 of them are acousticsI have nothing against Seagull or Canada but bought one of these NEW off the rave reviews and just recently I have had both theS6 and FGX730 for five years pulled the S6 out for another try just because I could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used Yamaha IT DIDSide by side I went through the chords on each guitar and had to finally come to the conclusion that the Seagull had to goWith a price tag of 42000 for the S6 and 28200 for its Yamaha equal the FG730S unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away I would stay away from this guitar and look elsewhereOh by the way I have an S6 for sale Not as good as my used Yamaha FGX730SCA FG730S,neutral
I started using these at the suggestion of a friend a couple of years agoThey sound great and hold their tone for a long timeI jam with friends a couple of times a week and these strings hold up for a long time Best Strings for the money,positive
heard they were nice stringsthey do make betterbut just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet havent used yetbut,positive
Well made product strong and looks good I love this strap try one you wont be dissapointed Like always Dimarzio products are simply the best DiMarzio 2 Nylon ClipLock Guitar Strap Black,positive
It doesnt twist up like my standard black cable does but it will twist a bit over time Love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesnt just stick right out there If you really want to avoid onstage kinks then you MUST go wireless it is the ONLY way to avoids twisted cables no matter what type you buy This cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion Its worth spending a Jackson IMO Works great,positive
The Shure XLR Female to Male 14 Adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kitIve got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed toNow this one as pictured is the mono version which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced 14 jack If you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable this adapter will not work for you Youll need the TRS tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter A Must Have In The Audio Kit,positive
To all heavy music guitarist I highly recommend this one Try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star Ernie Ball 2215 Skinny TopHeavy Bottom Slinky,positive
Ive been playing guitar for more than 20 years Ive played 6 strings 12 strings bass acoustics and electrics When it comes to acoustic sound these strings produce the brightest clearest sound of any string Ive ever used Some strings have a bright sound and some have a clear distinct tone not muted or dull Still other strings have a rich full resonance that carries through a room This is the only string Ive ever used that has all of those qualities In fact the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded better than usual or really good that day Ive tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them Best sound of any acoustic string Ive ever used,positive
I was given a violin fiddle by my friend who decided they would never really learn to play The violin hadnt been used in quite some time so the pegs were really loose and wouldnt tune at all I got this product to see if I could fix the problem It worked just as it said it would A drop or two on each peg tightened them up enough to be able to tune the violinNow that its being played more regularly its easier to tune but know that if they pegs get loose again I have the product to fix the problem Works Just Like Its Advertised,positive
I just got this pedal so I dont know how it will hold up over a long period of time But on first play it pleasantly surprized me It does give you some of the way out sounds other pedals my give but it does provide a gradual increase in phase as you turn the one knob Mine came with a 9 volt in it but you can also use a adapter Useful tones at dollar store price good deal best bet for players on a budget,positive
I am not going to say this pickup is the best thing since sliced bread but it is built solidly and built to last It is simple practical and cheap There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that You dont buy 15000 pickup for a 200300 instrument Being able to plug in and be selfsufficient in most rooms especially at open mics is easier and better than relying on a mic especially for beginners because it takes skill and discipline to stay within the mics sweet spot Also some roomsPAshosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument At least a pickup like this has the potential for keeping the sound front and center I will experiment with different instruments write more about the quality laterThat said there is only one piezo element unlike a KK pickup for example So it is limited in giving you optimal sound no matter where it is placed Also in case you cannot tell from the image the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack so it can only be used inside your instrument which means drilling a hole Solid Cheap Internal Pickup,positive
wow haha this chinareally packs a punch haha I got this china and was blown away by it my band loves it the crowds love it and most importantly it is very loud and trashy great for hardcore drummers China,positive
This capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is nofuss with positive microaction that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place Holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose Removal is simple also just press the release tab and its ready to remove no muss no fuss it really does work that well Highly recommend Top of the line capo well worth the price,positive
This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier The controls are Volume off Tone and overdrive It also has a headphone jack In my honest opinion it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound like jazz or country or semi distorted and more rock If your looking for an small amp that will do metal this may not be for you Defintely get the Danelectro DA1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick Overall its pretty good Good amp for on the go jamming,positive
Spend a few more bucks and get a padded one This one is comfortable for 10 mins then its cramp time Just save yourself the hassle this one is too cheap to return and while its OK its not great for longterm playing Good for the price but still not good,positive
While Im spectacle on what I want to 34clean my baby with Fender P Bass and after reading many feed backs on Amazon I decided to try this kit My Bass is not that old but really needed to be cleaned and polished This kit really make it so clean it looks better than when I purchased it new No greasy residue either My fret board looks so good to Just dont use it on maple wood the lighter color at least that is what the directions states because it my yellow this lighter color I can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red The other cleaners and polishes are great too I will definitely purchase this kit again when I run out of the supplies Super Kit Works very well,positive
I chose these strings based on reviews I have read on the website I was definitely not disappointed This string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body I have a Dot Studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly My son loves them for metal We will continue to use Beefy Slinky strings Slinky Rocks,positive
As soon as I kicked this pedal in at unity gain the difference was obvious I am most please at the boost feature which is amazing for one important reason the noise level is nothing like what I was expecting I keep my amp clean I found that even at around 1100 the noise was still almost unnoticeable At noon up its there until you start playing but even then its still much lower that the guitar Theres also an almost expanderexciter FX going on which is very noticeable especially when I compared it to my BBE FREQ BOOST First rate pedal Fantastic Boost Enhancer,positive
This guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leatherJust what I neededI am very happy with it and thank you Rich B Great strap,positive
As a musician Im in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner I got the package of two Unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death A new battery didnt resurrect it I couldnt find the other one because theyre small and black I finally did find it and have used it several weeks on my Guild Acoustic and it works nicely so far In fact it works really nice If you are concerned about stage appearance this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig a plus because its pretty small but big enough to read At the cheap price it wasnt worth my time to try returning the first one I just decided to eat the loss Im crossing my fingers hoping this one will last If you are playing a really nice collectible guitar be cautious because these tuners and capos too can damage the finish permanently I use a tuner on my Gibson Johnny Smith while I play but always take it off when Im done playing Tuners tuners tuners,neutral
but not great either The needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch It also appears that the tuner wasnt reliable on the pitch end either Recently ordered the red SNARK tuner here on Amazon and I think its much better the Intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it the snark is a little more bulkyUltimately the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch and readability Snark wins out this tuner works for sure but I dont think its the best out thereThe Snark is cheaper too Meh not bad,neutral
I received a pair of these two weeks ago and am happy with my purchase They seem well put together and just feel nice They also came with two Velcro ties each With proper care Im confident these cables will last a very long time Very Nice Cables,positive
This is a good pedal overall rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so I took the chance and Im pleased As some have said the low range has quite a steep slope to it uncomfortable foot angle But its a big pedal and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so I can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth I wish the TS jacks were topbottom instead of side by side seems it would take 14 right angle connectors better One gets in the way of the other Or even better if it were a TRS jack so youd only need one input I might modify it for that Good stereo pedal,positive
I dont often use a pick for my soprano uke The Mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that I really like especially if Im looking for a brighter sound Nice Product,positive

Heres what youll need to know about this product if youre interested in getting one1 The head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config Thats a good thing2 The trigger is a rocker switch so you can wind and unwindquickly Thats a good thing for the most part3 It is not variable speed One speed FAST RPM It takes some practice and patience Nothing special just the will to get used to it Initially and until you get used to it youll have the head jumping off the peg Dont fret bad pun a few minutes of rehearsal with it and youll get to like it Ive opted to pull the trigger in short bursts so as to refrain from having a string change remind you of a NASCAR tire change in the pit and especially because when you get close to the desired tension you need to go slowly so as not to overrun itI would have much preferred a device that has a twoposition switch slow and fast position on the trigger for more control Ive rated it 4stars not 5 not because there is anything wrong with it or that it doesnt work It does all that the advertisements say it will Its the aspect of the device I had to find out the hard way that keeps me from giving it a perfect scoreAll in all be patient and all will be well Realistically I dont need to change a set of strings in just a couple of minutes Ive got hours if I chose to I suspect most folks are in the same position If youre a roadie for a big group I could see the needthe need for speed But alas Im not So like some of the other things Ive purchased along the way I now have a new toy I works Im satisfied for nowDP Good product but be careful,positive
Let me start by saying I used to work for Line 6 so I know modeling pedalsI have nearly every modeling pedal Line 6 makesbut I was looking to minimize the rig that I take with me to the bistrosize gigs that I play most of the time In general all I really want is the Vox AC30 tone and maybe a delay pedal or some other single effect I use a very small ZT Lunchbox amp for this sort of thing and its solid state so you basically get a nice loud straight ahead tone which is nice but makes our cover tunes a little less authentic sounding I heard some sound samples online comparing this pedal to the Tech21 Liverpool pedal and to my earthere wasnt a 150 difference Very convincing and just 40 I pair this up with a Line 6 M9 and I can get most any tone I need for Beatles Tom Petty and all of the 60s 70s tones I need Love this pedal Way better than it ought to be,positive
I have a Blue Voodoo all tube amp Its a dinosaur but has a great tone Sadly I tried revamping it with all new tubes but though it gave me the drive I needed it also raised the noise level tremendously This was my last resource before selling an amp I did not want to part with I thought this pedal would do the trick I was right You would think with just one AX7 tube you would get just so much drive but this puppy gives more than expected Behringer used to be known as junk but no more Love this thing,positive
Very nice metronome with just enough features In particular I love the name based tempos displayed on the face many metronomes do not have that feature Sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off Great metronome,positive
This isnt a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges usually for a whammy bar and not using these heavier strings alreadyI wanted a little fuller sound than the 1046 slinky strings aka regular slinky and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefys I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar Every time I got the higher strings in tune the lowers would go down as much as a half note It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress The final time I tightened them down the high E string broke Since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings However given how far I tightened the tension screws I think I would have had to purchase an additional tension spring not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it to get the bridge flush with the bodyAs I said this isnt a knock of these strings I never really got a chance to play them Just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings It can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a 45 degree angle to your guitar and if you arent careful you can damage your guitar Beware Guitars with floating bridges,positive
Great little tuner works on everything I own which is 3 acoustics and 1 gretsch hollow body Great sensitivity and I love the Metronome built in it as well pitch is right on,positive
A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and Ive never had cause to remove it At first I thought Id hate the look of it there but its never bothered me one bit Reaching for pics is never a problem I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal Ive stuck this thing on my guitar,positive
Another easy modification for my Indonesian Telecaster Squier Better looks and function Tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides Fender American Series String Guides,positive
This is an amazing guitar I couldnt put it down I have experience playing really really expensive guitars My 500 beater acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all I couldnt imagine what I would b getting for 90 By was I wrong Its my best acoustic currently This thing sounds like sustains and holds its own tune like a similar 200000 Martin model and thats ZERO exaggeration Get it and see you will be blown away I bought a second one I just wish I had found this guitar sooner UNBELIEVABLE,positive
My son was very happy with this guitar strap He is just developing good techniques in playing and the comfort of this strap works well Guitar Strap,positive
Edit Ive had to downgrade my star rating a bit so Ive revised my review full explanation below but in short this just doesnt work as well for me as the SN1Background I have the original SN1 as well and have had it for a couple years The ball socket on the back of the tuning head broke fairly quickly when I forgot to remove it from the headstock before putting it in the gig bag Protec Contego semirigid hybrid case with a little more room around the headstock than your average padded bag I rigged a repair that has worked OK but figured a replacement was in order However other than the broken socket this has been one of the best tuners Ive ever used Very quick and intuitive Bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions Fast response on all strings including the low B on several five string basses Despite what I feel is a weakness in the design the fragile socket I still felt so good about the functionality of the product that I ordered another this time the SN8B Super Tight tuner I decided to go with another model in the hopes that a newer model might be a little better reinforced at the ball sockets hence the super tight perhapsOut of the box the SN8 is almost identical to the original save for the obvious color differences Then clamp appears the same and doesnt seem to have any greater clamping force that I could detect Turning it on though the display is quite different Basically it is much more to the point The indicator bars either side of the center pitch intune dead center are much wider and fewer meaning a less granular and less precise display but one that is very easy to read at a glance in any light This could be a mixed blessing but the up side is it is brighter simpler and potentially quicker for on the fly tuning The downside is it is not granular enough to say intonate an instruments bridge It also seems to respond much quicker which I am realizing is also mixed blessing and here we have the missing star The speed also means it responds really quickly to all input meaning it seems to want to constantly change the note it is sensing It seems much more twitchy than the sn1 Unless you are able to mute every other string fully it will jump between notes frequently This is also one of my many complaints about the Planet Waves MiniHeadstock Tuner too Ive found that attempting to tune with loud background music or other instruments blasting through a PA will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies even if I successfully mute all other strings making tuning with the SN8 that much more difficult The differences here between the SN8 and SN1 are quite noticeable For that reason I just ordered another SN1I cant say how this tuner would work for other instruments as I am a bass player Im not sure there is or isnt a defect or flaw here perhaps it just didnt live up to my expectations set high by my awesome experience with the original Simply put my sampling size is too small to say for sure or proclaim this a bad product All I know is that it just isnt working very well for me If I saved the packaging for this one I may consider sending it back in exchange for a second SN1 or perhaps another model If not itll probably be the one I hand others when they want to borrow my tuner Merely OK not liking it as much as the SN1,neutral
I bought this strap because I wanted to draw on it with sharpie and then cover it with a clear coat to preserve the sharpie This is a good sized strap with a nice drawing surface My plan worked and this is a good quality strap to do it on And such a good price Great qualityGreat price,positive
man yall yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz its all good and stuff man because like when you be spittin some siK leeriX and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel meay yo lets go Astonishing microphone,positive
No this tuner is NOT super tight Its ok but not super tight I bought this because the tuner in the RP1000 is pretty sloppy Based on owning this for a couple of weeks I would say that it is just about as sloppy as the RP1000 I will use it on stage but for recording I will stick to the app on my phone Oh yeah I almost forgot when you register the tuner you get a PDF download of Secret Chords The Pros Dont Know Its good for a laughPros Bright easy to read display fast response timeCons Nowhere near what I would call super tightBottom line Save your bread and get something else if you need a tight tuning I would suggest the Snark SN1 Its cheaper and works very well Super Tight,neutral
I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that its a nice little portable ampOf course you cant drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive I like this very much,positive
When i bought this i didnt think it was going to be as good as it is It seemed a little plasticie from the photos so i didnt think it was going to hold up very well It actually really surpassed my expectations however The winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiplesized tuners It was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem For 7 dollars its a really good deal This thing is awesome,positive
I use this all the time for acoustic guitarbanjomandolin as well as an autoharp and my daughters fiddle Ill be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard This works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused For my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open G even if its too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well Ive used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the jobNobody really gets excited about tuners but Ive been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that I know of when I started out If you wanted to tune and didnt have a 14 input good luck Great tuner for acoustic instruments,positive
I am average build and play a strat I shouldnt have to feel like this thing just barely fits me I wish it had at least one more inch Excellent quality but short,neutral
Great stereo sound out of the keyboardsMy keys had a single 1434 stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm I highly recommend this cable Perfect,positive
I bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago Theyve been the best straps along with the same straps without the grommets that Ive used I figured Id save a bit and get a couple more from Amazon I got them fast and saved twenty bucks They do fine with my fairly heavy Fender and St Blues guitars as well as my P bass They are middle of the road for price and width but give me no comfort issues at all My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets Super tight and easy to lower Raising it is a different story though I just save the fast 34lower played34 songs for last Those are the best ones anyway Excellent strap Just bought my fourth strap,positive
Does not stay on to well moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned OK,neutral
I got this pretty fast I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone Im still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price First the tuner issues that Ive been reading about Replace the strings I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune A set of DAddario 10s cured that straight away or whatever you prefer just change them The tuners arent the best but they are not to blame its the cheap strings Now technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut Never had to do this to the nut on an electric not even on a used guitar The nut slot was cut too deep as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most Ive ever had to use After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matterIf I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal But as Im looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work Im steadily staring at the QC passed sticker Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something NOWafter I did this it is sweet I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w Duncans and Dimarzios The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them Id argue that this is as good as any Epi Ive ever played as far as pups and all so dont hesitate there because I dont really care for Epis and Im in love with it I bought this to sell mainly but now The build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it Otherwise Id highly recommend a more expensive model The 299 models are great right out of the box usually 3 Stars Good value but it needed a lot of work,neutral
These picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side I was looking for a semisoft felt picks On the hard side,neutral
Pro Tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments Their low cost black nylon guitar strap is a well constructed high quality item that is a top seller at Amazon The large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about 18 inch Although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug some type of strap retainer would still be recommended Black works with most colors and this strap should last for a long time but it is so inexpensive if you qualify for free shipping you might want to consider ordering a spare basic black strap,positive
like title says the item does what its supposed to you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item I love the ability to have separate control over both inputs Ive had it for a few months and Im experiencing some noise on the pots which I didnt expect I thought it wouldve lasted a little longer I can open it and clean the pots but again I expected a little more life out of it battery operation wouldve been nice but like I said does what it is supposed to well enough that Ive bought 2 of them Okay item great price,positive
What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone Im not saying the tone is bad but its not as good as quality strings with no coat That having been said Im pleased with them as a string for guitar practice They last for months without a change in tone I dont play much in public venues so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do Id Probably Buy These Again,positive
Between the blue and the yellow I have my needs covered These have a weird feeling when you first get them like they have powder on them But within 10 minutes of using it itll stick with you much better I love these picks Great picks,positive
I have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years I have found no major issues with any of them Expect to do a small amount of fretwork such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends checking the frets for crowns filing those down and polishing the frets As with any neck even the high dollar ones the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up They come unfinished but well sanded I sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box I like to use 3 coats of amber and 6 to 9 coats of clear lacquer satin or semi gloss None of these are select quarter sawn wood but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument Import Maple neck,positive
I placed mine on the back side of my amp in a safe from bump spot I keep a few picks in it for easy access and I always know where to find them The double stick tape that came on it has worked well Its a cost effective way to always have a few picks handy and not loose in a pocket getting lost Try one Very handy,positive
The main reason I bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics is because I had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop A that is a must I have to say that after owning it for a while I must agree Ive used other tuners when I happened to not bring this one along and thats been my experience Also its easy to read which note youre on when youre on a dimly lit stage My fav pedal tuner,positive
Wow Im really impressed with this tuner Strumming the strings gives you a quick overview of which strings are out of tune and as you tune each string it automatically switches to a chromatic mode Its quick its accurate and it just worksWELL This is a FANTASTIC Tuner,positive
I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 which has a flawless basic looper built in but only 20 seconds record and no undo I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldnt need to carry a power adapter alongThe factory battery lasted about 1 hour The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes I started recording a loop with another 3rd fresh battery tested 910 v with a multimeter and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording suggesting that it was faulty The lights started coming on and off randomly recordundoall three together then off then undo on then all three on etc etcThe first time I used the JamMan XT with the factory battery it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it suckedI am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything so I know it was not my poor technique The main problem was that it didnt matter how hard I tried even if I did a manual fade out there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start This makes the unit uselessAlso it is poorly conceived in that to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws exposing the delicate printed circuit boardThe potential for damage here is very high Also replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible read INEVITABLE damageI have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this oneIts going back to the store where I purchased it Very dissapointed in Digitech,negative
Very good string Ive been using Elixir strings for about ten years now Ive been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more months Within these ten years Ive only had 2 strings break on me and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating 6String,positive
This was exactly what I needed for the price range I could afford in a crunch My old mic just wasnt cutting it going into my computers USB audio interfaceThere are nice changes in sound texture from different angles It is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals It is recording my guitar beautifullyIve even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar Ive set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole slightly back and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little I found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and cleanIm very happy with this unit price considered but Id have to pay a LOT more to improved on it Ill probably get another one I kind of wish Id have bought that combo kit Great Im happy,positive
I love this light It runs on electric so no need for batteries The goosenecks are metal and well made and the LED lights have switches that can turn on single or double LEDs on each side It will clip on anything you want to hold it Its simple well made and works great Nice light for small areas,positive
Ive been playing guitar for years and personally I would prefer Cleartone or Elixir strings I bought these for my little sister and she loves them They have a really nice sound to them I feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these Pretty nice stings,positive
I do question the leather part but since it doesnt say what kind of leather I suppose thats fine its still a good strap either way Nice strap,positive
I use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage Rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive Lighter than a full boom Good alternative to a boom,positive
Awesome pedal I love the joyo pedals they dont break the bank and sound awesome Glad I bought this pedal love joyo,positive
46 starsMy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality The AD is often weak and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multitracking Apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy the AD is quite smooth and it transfers the signal near perfectly And little it is not much bigger than the jack If Bon Scott only knewBut small though it may be theres plenty of signal processing power in there and while it doesnt stand up my best outboard gear it offers very clean clear sound transfers from guitar bass keys and line mics so that you can do goodsounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the JAM as interface Which is yet another step forward in highquality home recordings I like the thought that were getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites and not paying Crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file Record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this JAM and maybe soon enough well see artists keeping ALL of the profits from their art Imagine thatThis offers very close to studio quality but keep in mind that even with 24bit it is solid state Once youve used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make I ran this through one of mine and the AB made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its placeSpeaking of Crapple the ads for this suggest that it is for iStuff only which is not true I ran it on 7 Ultimate and it worked a charm so dont be fooled by the typically proprietary ads which Cook and co probably insist on 34Dont mention anybody but us Offer no alternatives They must stay in our universe34 Well you neednt this works with almost anything so dont be fooled by the ad copyThe only negative I can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build making one wonder how good the internals are and how long theyll hold up A stronger more solid sleeve would have been nice especially at the price of 130 But it does sound good though as it may be used for portable purposes you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks dont mess with it Take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music Good clear AD almost no latency and works with Windoze,positive
Play very mello easy on my fingers too Cant come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on My Taylor acoustic Play like a dream,positive
this is the best mic for its quality and its price perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordablei will buy another one of this perfect mic,positive
Got this based on other reviews especially one who took the time to really expound on it I used it for recording a cassette to computer but I really bought it to use to interface my mixing board with my computer Should work just fine The seller was fast getting it to me over 2 weeks ahead of the projected arrival dateIf youve used other Behringer equipment you may or may not be impressed with their quality Just remember that although they may be engineered in Germany they are made in China Enuf said This particular unit seems to be built pretty well but time will tell It works great,positive
I had never owned an electronic tuner before but have used the large models and the iPhone apps This is a great product It is easy to use Adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument I havent banged it around but have had no problems with durability Bright easy to read display I would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike Quality Easy Perfect,positive
Tried this and was not happy Seemed to want to be off too much Got the Fender FT004 instead This one does have a great view on the LED but if it doesnt tune right whats the point I would try the Fender Just a note if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing Just a thought The one I got didnt work right,negative
I bought this Monster cable 12 feet angled and plugged it into my Create Amp WOW Clear and no static I can also wrap this monster up easily because it is not stiff but very plyable Heavy duty and rugged it should last forever Thinking about buying another one Great stuff Tame Monster,positive

With musical instruments standing about on my office floor I determined to find a better way to keep them available and so I decided to hang them on the walls This hanger was very easy to install It comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself or through drywall and into wall studs I used the predrilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily But a word of warning use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall If you dont your guitar will hang a bit cockeyed Big Fan,positive

I very recently bought this guitar for my young daughter based on the previous reviews Shes joined the jazz band at her school and since she is smaller than the average 12 year old she needed a smaller sized guitar It was packaged very well and it took a while just to get the guitar out of the packaging The only thing I have found so far that sort of disappointed me was that there were some dark stain blemishes on the white pick guard Trying to get the stains off with a damp paper towel didnt work so I took a special soft damp sponge made to remove stains and gently rubbed it over the spots They came off but the finish on the plastic pick guard is dulled where I had rubbed the stains off That sort of irked me However it didnt seem to bother my daughter nearly as much as it did meDespite the blemish episode it fits her perfectly I tried to tune it using a clampon Snark tuner That didnt work at all for some reason so we went to Guitar Center and bought an electric guitar tuner which you plug the cord into from the guitar That really worked well to tune the guitar The tuning pegs gears were stiff and a bit hard to turn When I change the strings I will adjust them to make them easier to turn The strings the guitar comes with are very cheap so Ill need to change those out soon for a much better set but theyll have to do for nowI plugged the guitar to my old Crate amp and it sounded pretty good The knobs on the front of the guitar turn well an did what they are supposed to do Its easy to control the tone and volume from the guitar without having to dicker much with the amp My daughter had a great time getting used to it Shes a great classical guitarist I teach classical guitar so playing an electric guitar was a new experience for her My old Strat is just too big and heavy for her and this black one looks good despite the dullness that only I can see on her and she was awesome playing jazz guitar in her school concert the other night Since this guitar is so inexpensive and is just right for a smaller person I really cant find anything major wrong to say about it Im glad I bought it just wish it didnt come with the stains It feels solid wellconstructed and not very heavy I like playing it tooIve ordered a really good gig bag new cord a Pignose amp just for her and of course a bunch of new electric guitar strings Shell find the small stuff in her stocking this Christmas I cant wait for us to do some mother and daughter electric guitar duets Squier Mini Electric GuitarBlack Fender,positive
The Fulltone Full Drive 2 is another incarnation of the original Fulldrive Now with MOSFET circuitry available via toggle switch this just makes the pedal even more flexible Not to mention boutique quality at a working mans priceThis device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish The volume knob gives you lots of gain the tone knob is a presence control the overdrive knob adjusts the level of overdrive and then there is the boost level Yes this is a 2switch pedal so when you are playing a chunky rhythm you can step on the boost switch for a great lead toneThe toggle switch in between the tone and drive knobs affect the pedals tonal character as well as how the knobs affect each other There is comp cut allowing for a cleaner boost FM for flat mids and vintage for a more Tubescreamer toneAs a bonus the pedal is also capable of running on 18v power for cleaner headroom which is handy for hum bucker pickupsIf you have the scratch and are looking for a perfect OD pedal then look at the Fulldrive 2 It may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board The go to overdrive,positive
I BOUGHT THESE FOR THE SOPRANO UKULELE I BOUGHT FOR MY LITTLE GREAT NIECE I DONT NEED TO USE THEM MYSELF I ALSO HAVE THE SAME QUALITY STRINGS ON MY BARITONE UKULELE THE STRINGS ARE VERY GOOD IF YOU HAVE A INEXPENSIVE UKULELE THE USE OF THESE STRING SHOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE TONE OF YOUR INSTRUMENT IF YOU ATTACH THE NEW STRINGS CAREFULLY THE TIME FOR THEM TO SETTLE DOWN AND STAY IN TUNE SHOULD NOT TAKE VERY LONG I LIKE THEM NO STRINGS ABOUT IT,positive
I thought I was buying the 10 footer and realize I ordered the 5 footer too late Lets be honest here what good is a 5 foot amp chord unless youre sitting on the amp My badI never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the 10 footers as it does for the 5 footers I would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet I goofed,neutral
Im on my second US600 pedal after the first one broke I plugged in a cheap cord into the input and when I went to pull it out it was stuck SoI applied a lot of force to pull the cord out When I did that I heard something break inside the pedal and when I went to use it again it didnt workI pulled the pedal apart and inspected it to see about repairs but ended up opting to buy a new one instead Even though the pedal has cheap housing which worries me a little bit the Boss equivalent of this pedal is 3 times as much So since this isnt a staple effect in my pedal board Im happy to go with something cheaper for nowProsCheap price sounds greatConsCheap housing may break if used a lot Great sounds poor quality housing,positive
Just recently a few months back got my first tube amp wanted a good analog delay pedal to go with it I found that the digital delay pedals left something to be desired at least for my earsAfter a lot of research and reading reviews I decided to give this Pedal a tryAll I can say is wowIt has excellent sound quality very low noise while off it is transparent in your petal chainThe settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very wellmade The best delay pedal,positive
Wow This amp is something else When it arrived I almost didnt realize what it was because it was so big This thing does everything You can set drums record cords over it and then dub in to the already recorded track and solo over it But whats even better is you can attach drums to it a bass to it a mic to it and a guitar to it and have a killer jam sessionIt has more sounds then I had time to comb through at first glance and more features then I know what to do withAMAZING AMPLIFIER WOW,positive
I just got this and love it My Fender Stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag padded well too I can fit all of my 34stuff34 into the MANY pockets as well This bag is amazing and nothing like what I expected for the price I paid It has shoulder straps to carry the bag and contents on my back and also has a large loop to hang the bag on a door or hook too If you need a bag to protect your fender and to carry you stuff in buy this one I LOVE IT I would expect to pay a hundred bucks for this kind of quality but only spent 30 bucks Perfect,positive
You can spend a ton more for a studiolevel multichannel interface but all I wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out 2x2 on my bargainbasement PC and this fits the bill Works perfectly with Audacity and Windows 7 plug and play Perfect entry level audio interface,positive
good for any guitar even if it is plastic it feel really strong on your guitar neck it is a really good buy f,neutral
This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad But if you want to use it for any recording at all even demos I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD The HD sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great This guy not so much There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig and it seemed to get worse over time It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy If you look you can usually find the HD somewhere for 80 a 50 difference is significant but the jump in quality and likely longevity of the product is definitely worth it I upgraded and would absolutely do it again Meh If you can spring for the iRigHD,negative
Ay yo homie this interface be off the hook you know i be all interfacin and stuff you feel thx behringer Good interface,positive
I am quite pleased with this product Its relatively inexpensive small and light weight It operates on two AA batteries included I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily I should have ordered the CM100 clipon tuner at the same time placed a separate order later to allow to tune in a noisy music jam or band environment You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches The metronome is pretty loud for the small size I have a hearing loss so if I can hear it even while playing it must be pretty good The speeds are from 40208 BPM You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP Preset values 404244889296 etc or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one 40 41 42206 207 208 etc Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 07 beats and also duplets triplets quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats It has a 18 mini earphone jack for private use It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously I bought mine from Austin Bazaar Shipping was FREE and FAST I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration Very Nice Tuner Metronome,positive
I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio However I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didnt want to spend a lot These did the trick fine They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way Especially for the price Okay they are not high end but I didnt need high end ones Great hook for the money,positive
I got the irig thinking id use it for performance but he app leaves somthing to be desired I had a very hard time fining a tone I could live with plus once you add any of the virtual pedals the feedback was rediculous iRig is cool App not so much,positive
Although this light is a little pricey in my opinion it really gets the job done I do like the fact that you can use batteries or acadapter to power the light The nine leds really light up my music stand The carrying case that comes with it is well made makestransportation keeping it stored easyR Joyner Mighty Bright Orchestra light,positive
I was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that I need a humidifier for my guitar At first I was not sure what I was looking for I found the product without too much difficulty I had learned from my instructor that these are small placed on the hole of the guitar and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition I started looking through the computer pages and settled on the Herco Guitar Humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product Now I feel I made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations and good music A Herco Guitar Humidifier You can avoid guitar busters,positive
It arrived on time and was as described Price was very reasonable It is easy to use with one hand and does the job Not sure what else can be said about a capo They either work or do not The other aspect is longevity and only use and time will tell that It works,positive
I really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky Very obvious Calls a lot of attention to itself all GIANT and redStill I cant fault its tuning prowess Its quick and pretty on the money It replaced my Roland Boss Tu12hWell more handy for tuning my sweet La Patrie nylon strung 34Motif34Would buy again but Id really prefer a more subdued color When the whole room needs to know that youre using a tuner,positive
Im a beginner guitar player going on intermediate and Ive quickly learned that anything from Jim Dunlop is quality stuff Great quality great sound,positive
So far Im very happy with this Microphone Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band Although a longer cable would be nice its great a cable and was included in the package Good Mic for the Price,positive
Such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz Makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes Worth every penny mind you Does require some length and height adjustment for some Epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put So far so good Tremendous improvement,positive
Tone is subjective I have little experience with tube voodoo So all I can say is that it is working well for me I would buy again Seems Fine to Me,positive
I bought 4 pcs of these at 8each shipped These are very well constructed and function very well too I am using these to tap the INSERTS from my mixer and send the signal to my Maudio Fast Track ultra for recording By putting the 14 TS partially in to the INSERT of my mixer and most mixers you can get a direct output without actually interupting the signal chain The other end of the 14 TS cable goes to the PDC21 and then I use the XLR output to connect to my Fast Track using either and XLR to XLR or and XLR to TRS cable My Fast Track did not like something about the signal level when I fed it directly from the mixer but with the PDC21 between the mixer and FTU it works fantastic This is for refernce recording in our jamspace not studio recording it works great for this applicationI have also used this as a DI box for guitar all of my gear is middle of the line not junk but not super highend I dont notice any tonesucking in my jamspace applicationI would definately buy more Got more than I paid for Good quality excellent price,positive
These were the strings I started on a year ago and have tried a few different brands in this time frame They hold up IMO as well or better than most brands Ive tried especially for the price I probably change my strings more than necessary so I have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality These fit that requirement well Still some great strings,positive
Does the job ive had this for about 7 months and it hasnt let me down yetexcept for that time I couldnt find it The winder the cutter and the pinpull all work well enough Noted Ive only used it to cut Elixir Nanoweb strings and nylon strings and they more on the soft side compared to regular steel strings Works as it should,positive
I desperately needed a real audio interface I was tired of my toy Behringer 1 io RCA usb thing After reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what I needed Its small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk Its got some solid pres and has enough for me to work with I didnt need the extra io enough to break the bank so 2i2 is all I wanted Im really pleased with this the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great It handles line and mic inputs just as well and the general rule of thumb sticks here that 70 about 23 oclock on these knobs is a good base level for the pres Phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful I dont like dealing with latency in Ableton so to be able to just monitor directly when Im playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great And the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each otherall in all Id say the design of this is very user friendlySome people reported driver issues with this and I cant say Ive really had any problems Im using Windows and I have to suggest using the ASIO drivers whenever possible I had some issues with iTunes where the audio would just stop and the level in the Windows sound menu was frozen at whatever had been playing All I had to do was disable and reenable in the device but that got kind of annoying I emailed Focusrite about it and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me but the problem kind of faded away so I never really figured out what that was I started using Fubar2000 because it supports ASIO and I havent had ANY issues with any program that uses an ASIO driver I have since started using iTunes again as well still much easier to manage the library in there and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then so who knows Great for the home studio,positive
I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear less clicky than a standard plastic pick My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point so I use them more But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent Theyre almost impossible to drop they sound and feel just right to me and they last seemingly forever Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks Great,positive
I dont know how this will work with other MIDI instruments but I tried it with the Roland TD9 drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off The respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the PC end of it it was just a freaking hassle I needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my Notebook which doesnt have a MIDI input but I gave up in the end and went with my desktop PC and its MIDI interface Doesnt work with electronic drums,negative
Durable and affordable The 60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick 60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick,positive
Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues I am very happy with the guitar It came well padded and was in excellent shape It was set up well and has played well out of the box Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didnt have to make any adjustments to the guitar Played as well after the change as it did before Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and its a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play free prime two day shipping no sales tax and saved about 80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifierThe only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer It is not a big deal to me but I thought Id mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone When I ordered this one I wasnt really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time Im glad I did very happy with my les paul,positive
The Dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition and looking great It also had two soft cloths that are needed for application removing excess and polishing I couldnt be happier Excellent Product,positive
Great deal on great strings They sound clear and bright and they last a good while Quality strings DO sound different and nearly as importantly they feel good too Great strings,positive
look this pedal doesnt cost a arm and leg but as far as other vibes and chorus pedals this pedal falls short but I wasnt looking at sending alot so it gets the job done you get what you play for,neutral
I paid only 29 and it is small and convenient I was impressed with the soundAt first I played it with my Line 6 15 watt amp I didnt like it cause of the squealing But then I read how you use it and all that Boy It worked greatI use it with a Tascam US 100 USB plugin to my computer and I get a good sound for practiceI still like my Line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain But this is a bargain and smallYou can use this with any USB audio interfaceIf you like ACDC you would like this There are different amp sounds you can getCheap and convenient Iam not disappointedMy opinion is that it sounds best with a USB guitar audio device such as Tascams US 100 For the price I like this,positive
This is a good product which Ive seen many people use however its not for all acoustic guitars That little bit of info was missing from the info although I should have known In my case my guitars sound hole is too small for this unit to be installed even though its supposedly 34tapered34 to fit a lot of different sound hole dimensions Didnt look tapered to me and I cant use it But then again it was pretty cheap and I may have a use for it some day Check your guitars sound hole diameter before ordering Not for all guitars,neutral
This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play withAnyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working it tracked nice and didnt tone suck too bad cool pedal that broke quick,negative
These may be my new favorite bass stringsLikes Bright Id call them 34very bright34 except they dont seem to have the harsh twangy tone Id expect They seem bright yet still soft Clear The lows sound present and clear Consistent flex Once I had these on for a couple of days the tuning seemed very stable The tone seems to sharpen less when they are played hard compared to my last strings DAddario brand To me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings Playability These feel pretty supple and effortless to work with Price I feel like I should be paying more for these stringsTechnology New design 34Textured round34 This is a roundwound string with a hexshaped coreOverall love these Especially for the price DAddario has a hit on their hands,positive
Ive tried Kyser capos and theyre good They work This capo however just works simply smoothly and its a great pleasure to operate Like a Seagull vs a Taylor 8 series they both work but one has more beauty in its being Made in China designed in Europe slippery a bit heavy but still very very nice Its more money than Id have liked to have paid but Im glad I did Did it improve my life Not at all It also didnt improve my guitar playing but somehow its just so much nicer to have than any other capo Ive used Its how a capo should be,positive
a well built pedal of good quality with enough weight to keep the body stable and a good 34middle of the travel34 execution point for sustain With the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedalingvery important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers especially older models this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment for most newer keyboards this doesnt matter as polarity can be edited globally or alternatively polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in Some other pedals particularly those from name manufacturers will only work with some keyboards That said I feel this Maudio compares favorably to its most visible competition Yamahas FC4 offering The Yamaha pedal is a bit heavier which I do like and subjectively implies better quality but in reality the Yamaha did not last under the same circumstances breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road Last the Yamaha FC4 does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch making this Maudio pedal a great all around optionIn my case this pedal has been on the live stage unpacked and packed tossed around a fair bit for 2 12 years with no problems an excellent pedal built well and feature rich would and have purchased multiples,positive
I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap microfiber cloth to polish off my guitars For the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polishThe cloth is just what I wanted It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear The polish is just that it is works to bring out a shine but it is not a cleaner You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish there is a bit of wax in there and it is not stringfriendly Nice inexpensive polish,positive
I really like my capo the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic and it works as it should However I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product For example I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer and rounded the back side of a guitar neck is rounded after all The spring could definitely be tighterI do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough Also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aestheticits not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarilyDont get me wrong this is a rather good product and its priced about right It just isnt a high end product5star perfect Works well looks nice minor complaints,positive
I like these 942 Pure Nickel strings nice tone work well on my Stratocaster with Fender locking tuners great combo even with ghost bends slides and pounding with Drop D and Open G tuning Good tone last longer,positive
I enjoy this very much Very good strings Its a good brand too I recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have Good Strings,positive
I ordered these for my husband the guitar player He loves these strings He said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great Highly recommended Guitar Strings Light,positive
I bought this to work with my 9 year old son This will do many cool things although I am not ready to turn him loose with it yet I have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software I have been using Audacity which is a free download I would pay the price again in a hartbeat Nice little unit,positive
Other reviews give an adequate overview of the kit and its potential so Ill just mention particular details The kick pedal spring tension was set too tight making the pedal hard to control and very frustrating to a beginner Fortunately the thumbscrew and nut adjustment is easy and made a tremendous improvement in feel and controlThe documentation is poor and inexcusably theres nothing better available online from Alesis The steps in the graphical setup page are less than ideal for a single person assembly The kit allows for tremendous flexibility in positioning the pads horizontally and vertically yet youre pretty much left on your own to discover this Experienced drummers will know what they want but I would have appreciated a suggested basic setup showing common variationsThe control modules buttons and operation are described but theres no detailed guide to the preset kits or selectable pad patches Youll just have to hear them and jot down your own notesThere seems to be an ongoing controversy over a firmware update to the controller module whether it fixes an issue with the snare drum pad responsiveness when struck simultaneously with the hi hat or is in fact the cause of an issue with the pad Ive noticed no such problem and as of this date Alesis has no such update on their site which leads me to suspect their former patch may have been bad andor theyve updated units currently being soldSpeaking of the snare the second outer zone for rimshots is nice but I can only get it to trigger while sticking from the outside The technique of laying the stick flat across the head and lifting one end doesnt seem to trigger the rimshot or perhaps I just havent worked out the touch yetIm interested in a natural sound probably close to a classic jazz kit and a couple of the presets work for me I also have Battery 3 and using the kit to trigger those samples opens up vast possibilities Still most of the time I just want to sit down and play and dont want to bother firing up the PC and loading software so its nice to have two workable options The headphone volume could be louder but running it into powered speakers and taking a headphone out from them solves that issueKeeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lintfree cloths Dampen one with a little warm water wring it out well and use a light circular motion to remove dust and dirt then wipe gently with the dry cloth to take up any residueThis is my first experience with an electronic kit and as others have mentioned the sensation really is fundamentally different from an acoustic instrument particularly when striking the cymbal pads It takes awhile to mentally balance the soft thud or click depending on which surface you strike from outside the headphones with the sampled drum sound within I wasnt sure I liked it for the first couple of weeks meaning I probably didnt but Ive gotten used to it and have gradually begun to relate to the DM6 on its own terms not as an imitation of an acoustic drum kit but as something else with its own special characteristics Not Out Of The Box Great But Gradually Hit The Mark,positive
This was a great investment for my home studio Ive been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my Condenser Microphone I should of bought this a long time ago Nady Pop Filter,positive
I was a little skeptical having used other strap lock systems But I took a chance this works well on my LP The strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots I really like it Works Well,positive
Its OK the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i cant complain about it not being worth what i paid for it i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive more adjustable and just more versatile would i buy this yes if i didnt try anything else first nuff said Very transparent,neutral
I wrote a review for the SN1 which is essentailly the same tuner except this one also has a mic Here is my other reviewI own a few tuners including a Boss Tu70 Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT1 clip on tuner I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use But now I have to say I think the Snark is a little better I bought the SN1 and the SN2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate The other great thing is they are chormatic so besides being a great tuner you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard The display is very easy to readbetter than the GoGo although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine I love the colors and the matte finish too The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs itits a no brainer Perfect tuner,positive
This interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget You can use it to record your old tapes or records and it will go straight through the interface to your computer via USB There is pretty much little to no latency and it isnt noticeable I plan on buying a tascam interface soon for around 7000 and that should make things better for me I will still use this to record anything on TV or like I said old tapes The software bundle is pretty much free as you can find everything on the internet they just bundled it together for you which is nice UCA222 Interface,neutral
If youre looking for a really durable stand this is a good one for the desk It just inconvenient that Amazon does list the product detail on the size of the screw head on top Make sure your mic holder fits Durable,positive
Made in the USA was a great thing to see Nothing but Chinese CRAP for sale anymoreIm looking at YOU NAFTA Sadly not as nice as the ones I remember from high school band classPlastic attachment clutch and EXTREMELY thin gauge metal Who knows what REAL QUALITY would cost these daysStill I do feel good knowing that an English speaking tax paying US citizen got to meet his house payment making theseGOD Bless the USA Purdy close to nicebut not quite,positive
it ok its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface11u rack not 12u its ok,positive
I was surprised of how well this stand is made Its worth 45 easily Ive used stands for over 27 years and this is the best Ive owned Great,positive
I have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work Focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this I have only made a few recording but I am going to make a lot more Very easy to use Good deal,positive
These headphones are almost perfect The sound is great good balance between highs and lows They are comfortable too as far as ear pads go The only problem is the size These are for people with big heads or who wear headphones over a hat or who are buying headphones for their pet grizzly bear Maybe all the people at Tascam have really big heads Mine is average and these slide down because the headband is too large even at the smallest setting So minus one star for that Otherwise sound quality is excellent Comes with a 14 inch adapter which is nice Good price Great sound a little on the large side,positive
Ive owned this pedal for about 8 years Its good overall but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me They just sound a bit inauthentic and this is noticeable at times but in a band setting probably wouldnt be noticable I think its the way they trail off The tails tend to have a little unnatural decay or somethingIve been using the Boss Fender reverb pedal for about 3 years now as my main reverb neither of my amps have reverb and what Ive done in the last year is that I use this Digitech with a wetter setting usually church or hall if I want reverb on a solo For that application it works fine and sounds great As a leave it on all the time reverb I find it a bit lackingBut if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse Plus this thing is obviously rugged Ive abused it not really just regular gigging abuse for all this time and its never failed to work But thats been my overall experience with Digitech stuff for a long time Good not great,neutral
Thee only flatwound strings Ive tried that sound significantly better than these are the Thomastiks which cost twice as much and theyre not twice as good Maybe if I was a working pro Id buy the Thomastiks but for me the DAddarios sound good and last a long timeIf youve never played flatwounds you might be surprised to discover that they far outlast round wound strings Thats because what kills the sound of strings is gunk from your fingers and the air getting in between the windings and damping the vibration Back when guitar strings were more a lot more expensive it wasnt that unusual to remove strings boil them and put them back on Some electric bassists still do this With flats the gunk doesnt get in between the wraps and if you dont break a string you can play a set for monthsI have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from 010s my Fenders to 013 my archtop Rockers playing 010s and 009s might be intimidated by 013s but theyre not that much harder to play and after a little practice its easy Jazzers seldom if ever play sixstring bar chords or bend strings which means you just dont need that much muscle anyway Flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action They dont vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they dont need as much clearanceIf youre looking for that classic electric jazz guitar sound flats are the way to go and the DAddarios are as good as you need Rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the DAddario flatwound 010s Almost the same sound as the Pyramids and a lot cheaper Excellent sound and long lasting,positive
Time will tell if they last longer than strings 13rd the price Visually they dont appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings I was expecting something different but as far as sound goes the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune even after playing 34smear notes34 on several songs My problem with cheaper strings DeAngelo was they would tarnish or rust quickly the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer Ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not Since these are literally triple the cost Ill know if it was worth the extra expense Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America Good or bad once I see the longevity of this set Ill add to this review at that time Nice tone,positive
What can I say that you havent already read about this amazing pedal If you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal If your looking to play out with it know that its cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds Have a backup Take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal That alone can cause problems As far as tone goes it rates very high on the Tone God List You can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal It has out muscled my 2 other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard I use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and I never turn it off once we start playing I leave it plugged in on the board all the time I reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off I carry a backup pedal I LOVE THIS PEDALjust dont ever drop it Just Wish It Was Built A Little Stronger,positive
Ive tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last 3040 years and Ive settled on DAddarios for all my guitars Their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency the price is right theyre color coded to make string changing easier and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more The 10s are my choice for rock and blues My favorite strings,positive
Its one great modeleri like the tweed that old tube sound and mic position on cabinetsI am using this with bass gives you a really clean treble and distortion if you like also try it with bass you will like itrock on Real Nice,positive
Dont let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you This is an awesome pedal Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you dont abuse it to much it should be fine You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price Buy this Love the sound,positive
We have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices Sounds great looks great the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight Even fixed another bands vox mic connector his sure cable was loose in the connector this cable was tight Has worked onSM57 Nady Starpower AKG 5800s MXL 990 Marshall and Mark bass amps and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the XLRs and on the numerous mixers And yes COLOR RULES Just Get Them,positive
I bought this with super saver shipping 58 days and it came in 3 so I was very happy about that Also the lightning itself looks awesome and the black in the background is darker in person than in the low quality picture One more thing is that the strap locks on very well by it self I have a big problem with that because the strap that came with my guitar sucked But hell this one is amazing I bought this one for my black fender and I think Im going to buy a white tribal for my white Ibanez Grg120bdx Great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price Awesome,positive
This is a cheap and easy upgrade At about 20 years old my MIM Standard strats hardware was starting to show her age Most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust For about 40 bucks I was able to replace all the screws springs bridge neck plate This is stage one of my rebuild The tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality 10 fold Dont forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them Great Upgrade,positive
This beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my Martin Ive heard horror stories about these devices coming loose and the guitars going head first into the floor Strings might look tacky but theyll stay on there if tied properlyJust make sure the button portion is thru the hole in your strap SECURELY then pulled it snugly so it wont pull out Cool Connect,positive
I probably got the wrong gauge these things have no give at all due to the thickness but I like the small size They are about half the size of a standard pick so they are very easy to control little size but huge tone,positive
I dont know what all the hype is over this thing The idea is good and its cute Its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out How many of these types of noise boxes do we need Not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it Go buy a 20 watt Roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also Or any combo little amp Its for bedroom use only You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire Being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you Just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot ITS BASICALLY A DISTORTION PEDAL IN A BOX,negative
Quick to clip on and off Really Is there anything else to say What else do you want it to doThese suckers are wonderfully reliableIve had one for about 10 years The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the bottom of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect However for a 1 keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them Can you go wrong NOGreat product The way a cap should be,positive
Well made tube with good amount of gain and highs Excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity For high gain metal however I found that its a bit too hairy For instance as V1 position in my preamp it had a little too much trebly sizzle versus other tubes For comparison a Sovtek has less of this hair and is tighter sounding but also has more of an upper midrange fizz which can get annoying In the end I switched the Tung Sol with a Ruby AC7 which was formerly in the V2 overdrive position and that got me better articulation with less fizz So Ruby AC7 in V1 Tung Sol in V2 thats been my best combo so far Good tube just too hairy for me,positive
These are a little larger than a traditionally sized what you normally see used picks Thus just a headsup Having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks I use all types and all brands and Fenders are always predictably great quality Classic Picks,positive
Give good crisp and live sound to my acoustic guitar it is affordable and the material is solid enough that it can withstand abuse Good Capo,positive
I used it to hold down the strings on my bass while I adjusted the truss rod Worked perfectly for that purpose Works for my four string bass,positive
exactly what I needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my ampdo yourself a favor always order threw Amazon dealers I placed an order threw onlinecarstereocom and had to report a scam operation to my credit card cotheir customer reviews were terrible yet I made the mistake of placing n orderright before my eyes they changed their BAD reviews to add good ones good product still use it hasslefree order,positive
I got this for 150 dollars when it was on sale I dont like 8 inch speakers for gigging but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a PA The 8 inch speaker is okay for practice and it has a jack for an external cabinet Be careful with the load you put on your amp though Excellent,positive
These sound good on my electrics The best sound I got was on my strat Good sustain and strings are holding up well Sound good,positive
works great stays out of the way cant ask for much more than that and expect to get it the price was half of what i was locally Its a Capo,positive
The US100 works fine for my needs rough and ready audio tracking with 32bit Cubase 5 on 64bit Windows 7 My PC is for generaluse with a nonstudio configuration no mixer nonphantom power mics headphone monitoringIf youre buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs youll need a separate mixer andor standalone phantom supply From the mixer you can cable to the US100s line input via RCA jacks on the backThere were a couple of hiccups during setup but I dont blame the device It uses stock OS drivers that loaded right up The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista but its accurate and youll manage with Win7 On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or cardbased audio and speakers I have Realtek onboard and 21 desktop speakersIm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and IO busses Once configured however its been solidId recommend checking out user forums for your particular softwareplatform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectationsOn an XP machine changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW On Win7 once I unplug the US100 the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers If I plug the US100 back in the settings revert again very reliable Even better if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI the software detects the change and I dont have to reconfigure connections or busses That may be a function of Cubase so again it pays to research your particular softwareWhile the US100 is connected youll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US100s headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks This is where the balance control is very helpful Its not a pan its a center position gain mixing the computers output from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds with direct monitoring of your input signal Very simple to use for overdubbing Some people may prefer a hard leftright pan while overdubbing I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific featureIf you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done there are a number ways to go 1 Unplug the US100 and restart your DAW 2 Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US100 to the minijack aux in on your desktop speakers 3 Run a minijack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US100 to the auxinWhile using the headphone jack the RCA audio outs are muted and visversa Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output but I can live without itAgain the US100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities You cant rely on the product description or packaging to answer that Fortunately theres enough userinformation out there for just about any setup it shouldnt be difficult to track down Consider Your Setup and How You Like to Work,positive
I could not beat the price The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear Also it not to big It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board Very happy with this item I bought this to work on my Boss Dynamic Wah in the Harmonizer Mode,positive
This cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine I am using it for my primary rig setup and I cant tell the different between this and some other cables Recommended Good cheap cable,positive
My advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications Cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another Yep always the gamble Works for some applications,negative
This does work as described It arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out The reason I only gave it two stars however is because I find it so uncomfortable Its quite hard on your collarbone I have added foam to it and now it works well but I suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place Works as described,negative
My eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo Its easy for him to use and adjust Good capo,positive
Like other reviewer wrote previously I received less picks than advertised I received a total of 7 picks I dont know if the people at customs borrowed some from me but I find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem Other than that the picks are good seem to be durable and produce a nice sound Less than 12 picksbut good sound,neutral
It really pains me to give anything but a 5star review to a BOSS product since Im such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall Those compliments apply equally to the CS3 Compression Sustainer And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a lessreliable brand in my signal chainHowever there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds noise to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit The former complaint is probably true though if youre enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer youre probably already contemplated using a noise gatesuppressor such as the BOSS NS2 Problem solvedAs for the latter complaint changes tone thats also true but its not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results The whole point of the CS3 is that its supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it This can result in a muddy neutered tone though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it I also find that with the settings all at 12 OClock the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settingsReally while BOSS pedals are considered to be expensive compared to many of the other effects out there the CS3 should really be viewed as a budget or entry level compressor when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of 200 The best thing you can say about the BOSS even compared to the similarlypriced MXR options is that the CS3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price The biggest negative of the pedal in my opinion is that the resulting sound might seem a little toocompressedBut there are a lot of things you could do with a CS3 and it works best paired with other pedals chorus delay some distortions that youre trying to smooth out Ultimately its a pedal that could have been better though there arent too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of 100 anyway Good but not great sustainleveler effect from BOSS,positive
I wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play But didnt want to spend the same amount on something that I could for a new guitar I am very pleased with the price and the quality They take great care to pack it well so no worries their either Buy this if you want a started that isnt bobo or a toy Wow,positive
Not perfect but a solid stand Prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do And the bottom part that holds the guitar isnt fixed so its good and bad Good because itll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles Bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do sometimes it just swings around annoyingly Simple and effective,positive
When I first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune Mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and I later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame Sometimes I just dont pay attention to the obviousIt turned out that there are 3 short tuners and 3 long ones The long ones go on the top 3 strings the short ones the bottom 3 strings get that because I had them on incorrectly And even worse I was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the 2 bottom strings The string treegoogle guitar string tree and youll see one was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners I know silly but I was not paying attentionThe reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune The string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune Please take a note of thatOverall a good product Great tuners but you must install correctly,positive
There seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case One reviewer says its made by Fender I seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on Show me proof Someone else seems to think its made by Epiphone Sorry to disappoint you but Epiphone doesnt make cases They accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost I have several Epiphone 335 Dots and a Gibson ES335 I bought Epiphone cases for all of them I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case I couldnt see any sense in paying more money just for the Gibson name My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case Although the cases have the Epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by TKL How do I know that youre wondering They have a TKL tag on the inside of the accessory compartment Thats been a few years ago The cases you get now could be made by a different company The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar Regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet Epiphones manufacturing standards so its got to be good This case will fit The 335 Dot Casino Sheraton and the Gibson ES335 Anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II has a much thicker body than the 335 Dot This case was not intended for the Emperor II Its a great case and will protect your guitar but its not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car I just bought two more of these cases for my Harmony Rockets One is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway Both guitars fit perfectly Sturdy Case,positive
Well made Capo Works as designed on my acoustic Easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings Just wish it had a spring so It could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use I am always setting it down and forgetting where I left it Well Made,positive
Does what it says I have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them Much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries Works Great,positive
This system does not fail Install it and you never have to worry about it again Although its a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while I put these on all of my guitars The best strap retention system on the market,positive
I am impressed how well this works I was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs This has solved itIts important to you to know the diameter of your guitars soundhole Ive tried this with 2 different acoustic electric guitars Fender CD60 and Fender Kingman both of them with 10cm4in diameter and fits perfectlyI had read all reviews before deciding purchase and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering I should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that Even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound unplugged I would not consider this as a solution for itIf you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar without hesitation this one is for you Easy and unexpensive antifeedback solution,positive
These dont sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other SM58s and Beta 58s in a band situation but that actually wasnt the purpose of these microphones the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel The facility we use these at the mics have a habit of walking away or escaping maybe stolen Perhaps They sound great through the ceiling they have onoff switches and theyre cheap we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when were down to 1 again Seems like theyll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us Useful in certain situations,positive
Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool boxFound the pin puller did not really work for me so put my old string winder from 20 yrs ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine Seemed no matter how I tried I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitarIt seems that 34C34 shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings and I find that is better done by hand So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature And the string winder itself also works well String cutter works pin puller not so much,positive
put them on my daughters guitar and she enjoys them anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playingill take ernies over martins but not over daddarios on my guitars though okay,positive
they work its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage ive done it it sucked worth every penny strap locks,positive
These strings sound super awesome Im not sure what the engineering specifics are but if your looking for responsive easy on the fingers strings with nice bendability and sustainability these puppies wont let you down Super Tone,positive
I purchased this case for my newLine 6 POD HD 500 Its a well built solid case for the price It fits the HD 500 very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables I wouldnt drop my POD in this thing but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well A solid case for the Line 6 POD HD 500,positive
It works well This is a classic design that people have used for years and I can see why It it isnt broke dont fix itThe only suggestion I would make is to have a different soundhole cover Maybe a sturdy plastic The soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket I think the price is a little high for what it is Rubber and foam tube Why do they charge so much Id like to know the markup It works as designed,positive
THis system works great I have a Taylor 910ce and two other guitars I use these on very simple and works great Love this system,positive
I usually use extralights because my fingers are wimps I like the bottom E to go down to a small 010 I have heard though that you get more oomph bass and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings so I decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead Also I finally bought my first Martin Woo Hoo and researched strings for it and I read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the Light Mediums were a happy medium and a good balanceWhen I got my Martin D15 M I cleaned it up and then restrung it with a set of these Light Mediums At first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast but that is because I am adding 025 width to the E string 010 to 0125 ouch I just have to build up my callouses which will take a few weeks of torture ugh But the sound is AWESOME Part of it is the Martin guitar of course but these strings when I hit the G chord ring out with a deep warm and longsustaining bass thump You feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings the 6th 5th and 4th The treble strings bend pretty easily No buzzing They have no coating so they SQUEAK like hell TIP I put a molecule or 2 of hand lotion on my fingertips 15 minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down These strings are great I recommend them I will try and update my review 3 months from now and let you know about their longevity etc Nice blend between light and medium,positive
While the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not so if youre threading matches the KSM32 look elsewhere Eh theres better out there,negative
My studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs I purchased several of these cables at varying lengths and found them quite acceptable for this application Im not sure Id put them in my remote recording kittheyre not really heavy duty But for speakers or other static applications theyre just fine Perfectly good speaker cable,positive
Just use a smartphone to record stuff This is a really weird not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones Not really worth the 75 I returned mine Use a smartphone,negative
This is one of many Behringer pedals that offer a unique standalone sound The chorus effects are well known and even included on many amps and featured on almost every multieffects pedal I like the individual pedals because I can add in just what I want instead of relying on someone elses idea in a preset This Chorus is just about right It has a range of sounds for different situations and is very reliable and well made There is no problem with the B tough plastic cases If you want a metal housing its for some sentimental reason thinking that metal is automatically better or more durable than plastic You just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs Nice reliable pedal,positive
I had changed my strings with some new Martins I got recently They were bloody awful Luckily Id also picked up a package of these Ernie Ball strings First of all they were packaged better than the Martins they went on more easily and after I tuned up they sound SO much better Thank you Ernie Ball for making far superior strings My guitar thanks you as well grin At last great strings,positive
these are a lighter tensioned version of their popular J74 strings the pitch is somewhat lower than the J74s and the effort needed to fret a note is much less nice for old fingers and beginners DAddario has not failed me yet,positive
I have other Behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them I use a power snake instead of batteries so I cannot comment on battery life or compartment access The box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence Great Chorus Pedal,positive
Snark tuners are great They are very accurate and are very inexpensive I have three of them so I can keep one in each guitar case Cant beat them for the price,positive
What I like about these spongy little things besides protecting the internals of the mic is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song youre singing Just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated so too can a colorful mic cover And my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs Whats your mood today,positive
Heard good things about the Ernie Ball Slinky string set and decided to give it try on our sons Taylor GS Mini Replaced the worn out strings out of that guitar and he is back in business Honestly though it is hard to really compare strings these seem fine and currently I see no reason to try another brand In conclusion I see no reason not to buy and install these againPlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help Good set of acoustic guitar strings,positive
This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside Upon receiving mine and assembling it it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle ChargerCity Microphone Stand Tablet Mount,negative
Great solid switch Works well for giving your Telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel As for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all I can say is that I have this in several of my Teles and I have never had a problem with the switch travel being too much for the plate Switch it up,positive
I have several MXR pedals Every one is superbexcept for this PHASE 90 the nonscript version reviewed here This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion a swoosh of sonic dirt I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedals distortion suggest some modifications Look up MXR Phase 90 Mods and Eriks Corner will show you how I made the R28 C11 and C12 modifications The result a slightly improved phaser one that still churned out plenty of distortion Finally I tried adjusting the internal trim pot On no setting could I get rid of you guessed it distortion I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable No luck BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESNT ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90 Adds lots of distortion unworthy of the MXR name,negative
Whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true Well unless if youve heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky but it sounds great when your recording songs Haha I record with fl studio and its even great so far I recommend you get this Whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true,positive
Id chose this cable cause I own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end I like the idea that you can cut the power and remove the cable from the instrument with having mute the amp or mixer I recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else Planet Waves 15Foot Circuit Breaker 14Inch Instrument Cable,positive

I have the Snark 2 but read that this was the best so far I got and agreethis works better I would recommend it to anyone Great tuner,positive
It is a fun little practice amp and I agree with the praise it gets The positives have been covered so Ill point out a few minor things I dont likeFirst of all the power button is on the back which is annoying The rest of the controls are on top why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and offNext I wish theyd just name the settings 34clean34 34overdrive34 34distortion34 and so on JC Clean Black Panel Brit combo and RFier mean nothing to meThen theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed A 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the backLastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy Not heavy like I cant pick it up just heavy for something called a micro ampNone of these are deal breakers just things I find annoying Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3 Nice little amp with a few annoyances,positive
I was a bit skeptical about buying this but after reading the reviews I thought why not It is actually a good little practice amp Im still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house I was using a mixer thats hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound That works great but sometimes I dont want to be tied down to the PC I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly Just be mindful that it isnt a 500 Marshall amp but it does well in a pinch Good Amp For The Money,positive
After playing for years with Elixir Nanoweb 8020s I decided to experiment with a few different coated strings I tried the Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor now discontinued and these EXP16s Ultimately I preferred the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze the best but the EXP16 are cheaper and the difference didnt warrant the extra cost so I decided to stick with these for now I wasnt a fan of the Alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension The EXP16s are smooth and have a very playable tension although not as smooth and easy as the Elixir 8020s As far as longevity these seem to last me about 2 months which is on par with other coated strings Ive tried except for the Elixir 8020s which average about 3 months Uncoated strings last me about a monthDepending on the style of play I prefer brighter or warmer strings but Id rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle Its a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle Even though they dont project as well as the Elixir 8020s they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones For live use with a pickup Id be more inclined to use the Elixirs but for unplugged or miced use I like the tone of these Good value,positive
Sounds disgusting Very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows Dont hope to take chords on it Only on first 4 strings may beTry out fenders mini amp if youre searching for a little thing or but a bigger one Yod better to buy a big one,negative
Let me be upfront I often use my electric guitar unplugged When I am plugged in I dont move around a lot So this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing But no hum or noise and seems solid It was very affordable Cant say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time but for the price I can not complain at all I suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage It works for me,positive
This tuner is very accurate It is well made and stays on without falling off I tested it with other tuners and its right on Easy to see when positioned correctly Accurate tuner,positive
I really like this strap I ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so I can have one on each guitar Theyre really comfortable Theyre much less bulky than most of the leather straps Ive seen so I can just keep them on the guitar in the caseIve had the original blue one I bought for about 3 years and it still looks and functions like new I like this so much I bought one for each guitar,positive
Tons of useful information on this wheel My only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written Seems like reasonably durable construction Compact enough to stow it in a guitar case Good learning experience,positive
Not a lot of moving parts on this piece LOL Its a simple piece to attach to your strat body What to say,positive
For the money you cannot beat these strings I change strings every other time I play a show about once a month and these always last and sound good Perfect for Ibanez guitars with special tuning Best Strings,positive
These really are direct replacements for the PRS SE line Only the machine heads are somewhat smaller A great product Great Replacement For PRS SE Line Of Guitar Tuners,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D8 600Ms Delay effects pedal works great and gives me as much delay as I need Theres no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the delay you want with no effort at all This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great Delay Delay and more Delay great,positive
The music stand is perfect for the keyboard I am playing It is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly GREAT CHOICE,positive
These are really great guitar locks I use them on all my guitars and I would highly recommend them to anyone The Absolute BEST,positive
I use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed I also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it Breaks down to a reasonable size for transport Great,positive

Despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box this is a highquality gig bag with plenty of storage space Fits either a Tele or Strat I dont typically keep my guitars in their cases but bags like this one come in handy for gigs short trips moves etc Nice styling touches too The bag has removable backstraps for carrying ease Giggity,positive
this box is very well made and will last a long time the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy i like the fact you can daisy chane this device with more of the same i am very happy with this purchase and i will be buying a few more now that i know they are made with quality and functions perfectly i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem Awesome Amp Box,positive
When this product appeared to be defective I contacted the seller While they agreed to an exchange they did say that I was liable for up to 581 in shipping costs I thought that more than 25 of the items cost was a bit muchI decided to conatct the ON STAGE people directly Not only did they seem genuinely cocerned about their product living up to their standadrs they patiently and politely guided me through the proper setup determined that the item was defective and then pronmised me a replacement without having to return the defective item a microphone boom I had the replacemnt in about four daysI have been using ON STAGE instrument and microphone stands for several years now They are extremely well manufactured they look great and are sturdy as heck And I am extremely greatful to the compnay for the way they handled my issueI have rarely been so satisfied with the way an issue was resolved and at the same extremely satisfied with the product as wellOn Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone StandSquier by Fender Affinity Telecaster Butterscotch BlondeShure SE115CL Sound Isolating Earphones ClearMini 35mm Flexible Microphone for PCLaptopSkype Great Manufacturer,positive
I will keep this short The price is unbelievable its nice to have three sets in a box and these are the best acoustic strings on the market Thats only my opinion and everyone has oneso many will disagreeI have an regular acoustic and an acoustic electric and strung both with these strings It made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar I find that most inexpensive guitars have cheap strings most can be vastly improved with something as simple as new strings I really believe in these strings When I find a good thing I am hooked and I will not use anything BUT these on anything acoustic On a guitar strings are everything The tone feel and bend is whats important These are very light and VERY easy on the fingers unlike clunky stock strings on most acoustics I guess they think you need big think strings to produce volumenot so Some will disagree saying they break if theyre too thin I would rather have a shorter life with strings getting a pure beautiful rich sound than have a long lasting flat string My thick stock strings were killing my fingers These are effortless to play and sound so sweet and mellow just like an acoustic should soundAgain someone will chime in and bash me for saying thisbut I would put my inexpensive Yamaha up against guitars costing 10 times what I paid I have no plans of changing brands now Ive made the string switch Some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway I can do a string changeover in about 15 minutes on a bad day Its worth the effort I dont plan on hammering my acoustic anyway Thats what the Fender is for AND its not that Im cheap either I own 18 guitars 16 of which are electrics 3 Gibson Les Pauls 2 Fender Strats one American a couple of Dillions another great find and some other nice guitarsMy Acoustic is just an inexpensive Yamaha 700 but is a very nice guitar for the money But after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive Martin It didnt take me long to throw a set of these on my acoustic electric and got the same results5 stars in my book more if theyd allow that There are no other options unless someone gives me a set that blow me away IMHO the best acoustic strings sold at any price,positive
This might be a really really nice stand but the one I received was defectiveone of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and wont attach so I have to return it for a refund Ill probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that its intact this time Defective,neutral

The Pyle Battery Powered PA System With Wireless Microphone is surprisingly well made and has features I would have expected on much more expensive equipment We run workshops often at our customers locations and needed a portable PA system that could easily be transported and doesnt require a lot of power Here are my observations Long Battery Life Worked for over 4 hours straight but can be connected to AC to work as well Wireless Microphone Built into the system has good range and acceptable sound Battery included Inputs for 2 Microphones 1 Guitar and 1 Audio Connection Each with its own volume control Portable Built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy Includes a miniPlug to 14 Converter A handy accessory Includes Echo Effect A fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice my kids loved playing with this Note My unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would workThis unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unitHighly Recommended Great Portable PA wWireless Microphone Highly Recommended,positive

This strap replaces another one just like it which I use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons For stage I like something heavier Good quality The holes work with my strap buttons okay My lower button is an output jack for an aftermarket pickup which is wider than a normal strap button But this strap works okay with it It just takes a little more force to get it on which Im sure will go away over time with use Great price for a simple strap at around 5 Simple works,positive
This tuner works really well i bought one a few months ago and its super precise I had it for a few months before I put it in my pocket and bumped into a wall and the socket snapped It still worked really well but i needed a lot of duct tape to hold it together 4 of my friends have had this same problem more than once but we were all not too careful with it if you dont bang it around its great i bought a new one Great little tuner,positive
I drop my pics on purpose now just so I can use it more often It does what its supposed to do what else can I say I LOVE IT,positive
I purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together It does and it does it well Very solid build never felt cheap in any way Perfect for its intended use I purchased a second one after using the first for one month Would buy again should the need arise Great for desktop use in podcasting,positive
These and the extra lights are great strings They felt so good on the guitar after the old set that I had Now Im stuck replacing them often because I love the feeling of new strings They play great have nice action and tone I use them on a Yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great Martin quality,positive
I am president of the International Press Association a global organization of photographers videographers and journalists We have been teaching our members to convert from shooting stills to videos on their DSLR cameras I needed this cord and a shorter one for an important assignment on a cruise ship and these guys came through in time for me to use both cords You can see them in use at our online publication IMPress in this article and video Thanks guys will be shopping with you again Fast service great product and fab price,positive
Folks that like the original Ibanez Tube King will love this pedal Sturdier construction than most of Behrengers other pedals The housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid Folks talk about how bad the stock tube is but that has not been my experience I may experement with a low gain JJ in the future but the stock tube is staying put for now Maybe I got lucky and they hand selected the right one This unit sounds really incredible when its running into the front end of my EL84 powered tube amp The sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain Sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp no suprise there Still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone Be forewarned this pedal is gigantic in dimension Who cares so long as it sounds this good Id wanted a vintage ChandlerButler Tube Driver forever but now I honestly dont need one This pedal gets me there on the cheap GREAT PEDAL,positive
Great concepteverything rolled into one product Winder String cutter and end pin remover The price is fair for all that Great idea,neutral
Ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this I recently bought it for my niece and taught her how to change her stringsThe different size gaps make it grab the tuning pegs much better than my old one I was able to use it on an electric steel string acoustic and classical and it grabbed them all rather well The string cutter works well and the peg puller does also So handy So useful,positive

I like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc on my guitars This is a nice part Looks awesome on my Les Paul Traditional Desert Burst Nice knobs,positive
Its pretty delayed and doesnt display the notes for very long but I play in drop G and it gets the job done The construction isnt something I wanna step on but in a bag its better than paying 100 Meh,positive
I love these stringsthey sound awesome on my acoustic However they do not last long but that is the price you pay for a good sound Not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge These sound great,positive
The knobs are a little sketchy they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong but the sound is just great This little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail I may buy a second one as a backup Behringer hit a home run with this one Not just a great sounding pedal for the price but an honest to goodness great sounding OD pedal No true bypass but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you wont detect any tone suck It sounds good enough that I dont mind the lack of true bypass Great sounding OD at any price,positive
Nice strap but a bit too stiff might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying Well built and good adjustability Very good for the price,positive
I always have problem finding pick when I need them and this product helps me solve the issue It is easy to use Good pick holder,positive
I feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarroacuten which is at least as big as but much thicker than a cello But its design appeared amenable to some homemodification that might make it work so at the price I took a chance and bought it Well the back of my guitarroacuten bulges out like a blowfish so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended my guitarroacutens body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks like they were made for that No modifications needed not even bendingSome reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over but I suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs COMPLETELY open and therefore extended to its widest base If you dont really LOOK closely as you open the legs youll think youve reached the stop before the legs are fully open I didnt have it fully open at first and it was a just a bit too easy to push over in my view but still acceptable When I discovered that I still had to open all three legs a bit more I retried it and it was much more steady That last 14 63mm of movement on each leg was worth 100 improvement The stand is fully as steady as I had hoped it possibly could be especially given the price AmazingAnyway I gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all I even like the way it appears to physically clamp down my guitarroacuten since it seemed to discourage itchy fingers from trying to pick it up while I was on break What a surprise it works fine for a guitarroacuten too,positive
i had no issues with this got it so i could tune on stage while playing without making lots of noise works great does exactly what it says definetly get the power supply with it so you never have to worry about a battery i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times great product but,positive
I was a bit disappointed in this gadget It just doesnt have the quality sound that I expected from the material written about it Ive had much better luck with a simple interface between my guitar and iPhone or iPad That arrangement isnt as compact as this Vox product but the sound is much more pleasing There are better products available,neutral
I use this for my uke my 12 string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty Taylor Easy to use very accurate highly recommended Great Little Tuner,positive
Not great but not bad as well The base strings feel really strange when sliding The 6th string and the 1st string were cut while I was playing so I had to change them the second day I installed them Bending feels easy Not as expected,neutral
What else can be said about them theyre good picks They strum well they pick well and they look good Theyre good picks,positive
This is intended to replace a MIM 6 screw Stratocaster bridge It only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing Thats why its so inexpensive What you see in the picture is what you getBut that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your MIM Strat The block is HUGE compared to a standard MIM bridge It was incredibly easy to install And the sustain is improvedOne tip which I forgot do not tighten the 6 screws into the body all the way The bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge The springs in the back keep it back The string tension keeps it balanced in the front What I did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one 14 turn back An amazing price and value,positive
This is the greatest practice amp ever And by practice I mean practicing by yourself and with a bandFirst its all tube so it sounds really good Its gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes It also takes pedals well and can sound like a beastSecond its 15 watts and is pretty darn loud Ive used it for band practice and its definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer At a bar youll probably need to mic it or use the included lineoutThird if the 1034 speaker isnt loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the 4x12 and 2x12 cabs I have Thatll make it loud enough for most barsFourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything youll need Most small tube amps dont have built in effects So if youre trying to practice down in the living room youre forced to drag your effects with you Thats annoying With this amp everything is built inFifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet You can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone elseSixth the price is amazing All tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow Fender is basically giving these things awayI love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch But considering the price thats understandable Theres no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them Youll only want the cover and footswitch if youre playing in a band Greatest Practice Amp Ever,positive
Our second week and all is WELL Nice and quiet Using Speakon Cables Mono to each Speaker to Speaker for easy mixing XLR to XLR from Mackie Mixer to PylePRO 1400 Watt amp Great value for the Garage Band and recording to the computer for publishing on Web or using as a small GIG amp Think I will get another one for the Stage Monitors Might as well go ALLIN PERFECT No LED issues here Amazoncom Provided this ONE,positive
Had to return the first one Second is holding its own Just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic Spot on when used correctly inline with cables So Far,positive
Its not that great You go through batteries like crazy and it doesnt work at all for bass Its fine for guitar or banjo Hopefully new models of these type of tuners get better,neutral
To start as the full name of this pedal would indicate this pedal is for tube amps I cant comment on how itll sound for a hybrid and my experience is that its definitely not for solid state Distortion pedals go much better with solid state Further tube screamers arent meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain again thats what a distortion pedal will do Tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harderand are most commonly used as a solo boost Tube screamers are in the category of overdrive pedals and like the name would indicate theyre meant add a little extra over an already driven amp but in a more natural smooth organic way then a distortion pedal wouldHOWEVER the Ibanez TS9dx does more than your typical tube screamer The extra knob that switches between ts9 hot and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options Let me expoundI play hard rock and metal through a Bugera 1990 head basically a Marshall JCM 900and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers While that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap its not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided A standard Ibanez TS9 or some other knockoff tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern heavier tones because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids again to help solos cut through the mix But the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem By switching to hot or turbo mode the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally I like the setting the best So the way I use this pedal is that Ill set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high Then for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound Ill kick on my ts9dx with the drive pretty low 9 oclock volume at 12 oclock tone about 1 oclock and mode With these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone and adds a little gain and volume So its basically like adding another channel to my ampI will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you tubescreamers in general and certainly this Ibanez ts9dx add midrange to your tone automatically And you cant dial it out The regular ts9 mode adds some low mids and a little more high mids The other modes add more low mids in particular which in part contribute to the overall thickness to the tone which can be great But if youre after a scooped mid sound say for metal then I would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost where the mids will help cut through the mixIn conclusion its probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt And yes this pedal will do that So will the BBE greenscreamer behringer tube overdrivemxr distortion plus Boss SD1 digitech bad monkey or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations But by adding the turbomode options the Ibanez TS9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players depending on the exact style in a way that these plethora of other options wont The pedal thatll push your amp into the next gear,positive
I have two of these High quality build Out of personal preferencethis capo design works best for me Tension is perfect for my Washburns One has light strings the other has medium I thought this was worth mentioning since the diameter of the strings might affect the clamping tension Both of them sound like there was no capo on Overall Im happy with this brand Highly recommended I own two,positive
Well over the past 4 years Ive been running through a bunch of these mini micro battery powered small tubed and solid state model budget amplifiersLets see done all the Blackheart small amps the Vox mini3 AC4TV Roland MICROCUBE plus a few other small amps I just sold my Fender Super Champ XD and wasnt going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors I just cannot jam the way Id like toI really liked all the above named amps but they really didnt give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors Loved the Fender Super Champ probably the best but there wasnt a headphone jack Same with the Blackhearts and the Vox AC4TV and the potential of these amps just couldnt be used by me So I settled on the Vox Mini3 4watt because it has a headphone jack is also AC or battery powered among a lot of other great features and sounds but I did have to give up tube amp optionSo as I said I sold my Super Champ like a week ago and as I was mailing it out using the Amazon online mailing appz when I saw a picture and price in the browser on this new Fender Mustang I and I figured what the hell Lets see what its got to offer for under 100 I mean everyone was giving it a 5star rating so whats a 100 bucks even though Ive never had a good sounding solid state ampWell I must say this thing rocks There are like 3 phases of model amps most I didnt like at first but was able to fine tune most of em to sound pretty great I mean its only a 100 amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals but it does stand up pretty nice Plus it has the headphone jack and a couple other plugins and effects and this thing will blow your ears out Most amplifier headphone jacks tap out and never got loud enough for me but this thing screams and blowout your ears Ive had it now like 3 days and was thinking about sending it back but for 100 theres nothing in the market that can compare or compete with its SOUND low pricing and options So Im now glad that I sold my Fender Super Champ XD and bought this one and put the other 150 back in my pocket yaThis is the best solid state amp Ive ever owned and I still miss the tube option But Im sure something better will appear next year and until then well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this Fender AMP Adding another Fender to my collection,positive

Would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice It is a little stiff feeling compared to the others I have purchased but overall it is very nice Decent quality but stiff,neutral
This is the equivalent to the Shure SM57 except for a quarter of the price The quality is almost the same and in terms of recording they are pretty much the same as well There allow a more natural sound than the SM57 I believe and are thus a better product Better than SM57,positive
I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1 because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing and 2 because they are super smooth Its like playing a silk guitar Get these strings Sweet Strings,positive

This has a nice smell and is good for maintaining the wood on the neck of your guitar Best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off Nice addition to guitar care,positive
I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic The guy at Dunlop told me oh yes they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic That is NOT the case I purchased multiple units and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than its worth But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculptureBecause of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fitIf anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap please reply to this feedbackWhat really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks dont know their products well enough to be recommending product Its called TRAIN your people Does NOT work for acoustic electric guitars,negative

I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size Great quality lasts forever You wont be dissapointed Better design,positive
This bag fits my Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar very wellbut no room to spare The outside pocket is too small for sheet music but works for small things like a tuner and short cable I prefer a bigger pocket but aside from that I cant complain This gig bag looks really sharp and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying Fits Epiphone Les Paul II,positive
Ive used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market Hosa is the best,positive
This little tuner is excellent Very accurate I love it I have other tuners but this one is the best I didnt realize it was so small I was concerned when I first open the package because of its size But this mini tuner is just plain amazing Im glad I bought it Amazing tuner,positive
This Epiphone Hardshell case is a real bargain Well built and functional just the perfect size for your Dot Casino 335 or in my case a Sheraton II Finished in faux leather a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort much like the old Fender Tolex NICE hardware on this case All the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid Hinges too The handle isnt going anywhere Inside you get a nice soft plush interior the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitarTop all that off with 2 feet on the end for standing upright 2 well placed feet on the side and 3 on the bottom NO matter which way you place the case other than upside down both your guitar and case are protected You get a total of FIVE good quality latches one of them locks key included and hinges at either end As I said the hardware on the case is really good For under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargainI was immediately struck by how SOLID this case feels It is no lightweight either I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open etc Mine came almost scuff free out of the box but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing Still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the priceIf I could make just two criticisms it would be that I notice the stitching appears to be single stitched rather than double stitched Also the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented It is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break Also when you close the case instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing I would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself This is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroomI have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon Overall I am extremely pleased with this case and my Sheraton II is happy to have found a long term home An excellent value highly recommended Epiphone is on the case,positive
I usually just use my fingers to strum my tenor uke but there are songs where a pick is more appropriate I used to have an old felt pick made back in the 1940s but it disintegrated over time and the newer felt picks Ive found just dont feel the sameI bought a set of soft medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and Im really happy with the results I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgies really nice for my Jazz Bass I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars but the Wedgies are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instrumentsId love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday but it still works very well for me Much better than a felt or hard plastic pick,positive
This this is great It is my first condenser mic and at 149 it is a stealIve always used Shure or Heil mics that cost over 250 This mic in a studio application smokes them It is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it But if you really want to be amazed do an AB comparisonThis mic has convinced me to purchase the AudioTechnica AT4040 Cant wait to get it and I will review it also Best inexpensive mic Ive ever had,positive

Bought a Takamine 40 years ago It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid 125 Adjusted for inflation that would be 800 when I bought this JasmineI got a superb machine for the money Simply superb Its not my old Takamine but the negative differences are slight and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitarThe first is that the finish is not as good The sanding between coats was skimped which means that the finish on the front has some texture the sides of the guitar are also a bit roughThe second probably flows from the first The tone is a touch wooden it doesnt sing as the old Taka didPositives the intonation is true at the twelfth fret and it is playable and enjoyable to play with a slide After the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tuneFor its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playingA very young child or a small woman will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort For everyone else it should fit pretty comfortablyThe intonation is true at the twelfth fret and it is playable and enjoyable to play with a slide After the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tuneAny beginner and more than a few costsensitive intermediate players will be pleased with this guitar Almost as good as it was 40 years ago,positive
It serves its purpose Doesnt hold as many pick as I expected Looking back cant see why I really need it A plastic bag does fine In fact I dont think Ive ever used after the first time I put the picks in it I just use the excess picks I put in a ziplock bag Functional decent price,positive
Its sturdy and very portable The two things I was looking forCant really compare to the others but for me worth the price I didnt have one at all and this workgs greatdelivered in a timely mannerthanks this thing is great,positive
I ordered this primarily for my 5 string Ovation Bass First there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings My Ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but I was finally got it on the bottom between the D G string tuners It does not respond well to an open B but octaves are fine and as long as I have confidence in my intonation it is no problem I tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on When I tried it on my Ibanz solid body 5string I found it to be even less likely to 34read34 quickly or at all Also worked great on my 6 strings ITS OK BUT,neutral
I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best These sounded different gel picks I do not like them Being see through distracts me They are a little scratchy on the edges Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing I just cant use them well Not what I would grab to play with,neutral
I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach The action on this guitar is perfect and required no set upwas ready to go out of the box I almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice I have been playing for about 30 years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet full rich sound If you are looking at this guitar buy it You will not be disappointed Great sounding guitar,positive

I like to walk around while I play Its a hangup of mine This strap works fine for that The only thing Ive noticed that can be annoying is that strap moves easily across my back so it is very easy to get the guitar out of position the neck too high or too low Other than that its a good deal for the price Maybe I just need a shirt with more cling Its a strap,neutral
These take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm They made my Cordoba C5 sound like a more expensive guitar Not overly bright just a richer tone Nice strings,positive
This is a very basic delay pedal with the obvious knobs delay volume time and repeats It has a nice bright sound never too muddy and its perfect for some Dave Gilmour style slap back delaysIt only works with a power adapter no battery This has its pros and cons on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less on the other side if your power adapter breaks youre out of luckUnlike many similar pedals this one doesnt let you set infinite repeats this makes it impossible to make tricks a la Johnny Greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises This is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so I returned it Nonetheless the product itself is great cheap sturdy and it does exactly what its supposed to do Good basic slap delay pedal,positive
Great Recorder on so many levelsI use it for external audio recording for DSLR videoI was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo micsDinged it one star because the display and menu system is terribleNot intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functionsSomething I will have to get used to Great all in one Audio Recorder,positive

This is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds Change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument Amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it tooOnly drawback there is no volume control on the instrument itselfThe amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal BUT its all about the instrument and I give that a 5 Epiphone Les Paul Ukulele,positive
ConstructionThis Amp certainly looks sharp It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be but seems well put togetherControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly You can expand to add an optional 4 button switch that Fender sells separately and also includes in the IV and VOn the amp you have separate EQ knobs Treble Mids and Low you have a gain a volume a Master Volume and a Reverb Along with these you also have an LCD screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs You also have separate buttons for changing Amp models reverb delays and modulation effects The large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presetsThe controls are intuitive and easy to use It is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobsComparing to other ampsThe Fender GDEC 3 does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself You need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly But on the Mustang III you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computerI dont know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerfulThe Sound Most importantLet me first compare this amp to what Line 6 Vox and Peavy have offered in the past All of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects BUT How many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them Line 6 offers tons of sounds most of them are what I would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound What I find with Line 6 is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed They dont sound overdriven they just sound distorted Also Line 6 offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion These sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that I love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tonesWhat I can say about the Mustang III is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed The Vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds These are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the Real Thing You can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 8899 By playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps A few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are57 Champ This amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little 8 inch Champ Tons of character and tone You can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model Think the Jimi Blues cd The presets that use this amp that Fender created are all really fun and sound amazingFender Bassman Wow You can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model It has the recognizable tone of the Bassman modeled really well Big Bold bottom end with some singing highs65 Deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model Throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rockblues Or leave it alone for a beautiful clean toneThe British Amps are all good models of Vox and Marshall type amps They are all bold and in your face Just play one ACDC riff into the 70s amp and youll recognize the soundAs far as the Vintage tones goI dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere If you play rock blues Country hard rock or Jazz you have so many great choices People who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songsWhat surprises me is that Fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music I was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as goodI was wrong The 90s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it Im pretty sure that this is a Mesa Boogie type of model This is certainly your Metallica ampThe 2000 metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds tooThe BIG bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the SuperSonic This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever If you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this I play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that I like I personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this SuperSonic ampThe fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones You can have one guy who sets all 100 presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash It is limitlessI would without a doubt choose this amp over ANY modeling amp out there for practice and funI own a pimped out MIM Strat and a offtherack Classic Vibe Strat and Tele as well as a Les Paul style guitar They ALL sound very cool on this amp The Classic Vibe 60s Strat really impresses me through this amp So versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound I am really loving itThis amp can play really really loud with its 100 Watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes I have 4 kids and practice at night and this amp is perfectFender Fuse and Ableton SoftwareI have to admit that I really dont feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what I can do manually on the amp However Youll find amazing tones all over the Fender Fuse The system is super easy to use and store on your amp As with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you dont love and arent described well But you will find some gems tooI have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so I will have to save that review for laterThe FINAL WORDI am a Father of 4 who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes I like Vintage tones as much as Heavy stuff so I like a variety of tones I hate overprocessed guitar tones This amp is perfect for me Perfect The amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds It comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreAt 299 This amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased I have a 300 strat that I love that sounds beautiful through it After buying it I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play itThere is no better modeling amp for my needs Best Modeling Amp for Vintage Tones,positive
This are some great strings I have bought them my last 3 times and I will continue to buy them I like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar The tone is much bettter too Great Strings,positive

For this price you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things better yet get one for each guitar you ownTheyre reliable and easy to use And ACCURATEYou can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock That way theyre easy to read and dont screw up the look of your guitarWhy no 5 star review Because theyre battery eaters The provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming Not cool A rechargeable version would be good I do almost all my tuning with these now,positive
The price was most definately the main drawI am very glad that I placed the orderthese people are pleasant to work with strings,positive
Not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings Hope that helps thank you Works,positive
Good Quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery Better than going to the always overpriced Guitar Center Good Quality,positive
I noticed an immediate improvement in my playing as this tuner above all others I have tried Korg Intellitune etc brings your instrument into deadon ringing true tune across the instrument I use this on my Fender Stratocaster Gibson Les Paul Custom Fender Telecaster Fender StratAcoustic and Takaminie Classical Works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars With all of the features capo tune visual metronome acoustic as well as vibration tuning plus calibration This is one tuner you wont want to be without and the only one you need I own the RED one for guitar its the best tuner in the world,positive
I would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician They use a heavy metal casing that appears durable and the cord is decent enough for live sound but a very slight hum was present with my guitarharp amp I would pay this price for just the element It is truly a great buy and I would use it for armature work any day I use it for harp harmonica and it works great and it sounds smooth with vocals too I would recommend it to any friend and I already have Worth every penny Good deal and 95 similar to the real deal,positive
I highly recommend these tuners They are the best I have found for Fiddle and Mandolin They also work well with acoustical guitar Best Tuner I have for my Fiddle and Mandolin,positive
The Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III carbon fiber picks really helped improve my accuracy no doubt in large part due to their relative stiffness and profile I tend to drop picks and have tried numerous brands and types of picks but for ease of grip these are hard to beat I am a relatively inexperienced player and while more experienced players can address technical subtleties better than I can I have come to depend on these as they have helped me to hugely improve my picking accuracy in a relatively short time As far as durability goes they are the reigning champs I bought a pack of six and Ive been using them for a while now and cant tell them apart the three Ive used look like the three that are still in the bag to my eye I doubt seriously I will need to buy more for months who knows maybe years as they just dont seem to wear even after hours and hours of use I recommend these picks without reservation Great Grip And Incredibly Durable,positive
Yes you can make your own pop filter at home but you dont want to Why else would you be reading this Besides it wont look this goodIve purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one I wish it was I thought Id try something different just to see the differences Well I can tell you that there are significant differences between this and some of the others featured hereThe bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to The competitors that Ive tried do not If you do not have this rubber piece any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible Fortunately Nady placed this rubber piece on its clamp so this has never been an issueThe only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times A single dot of superglue fixed thatCompared to the other pop filters Ive seen and used this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you cant beat itAnd yes pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones Just buy one now save yourself the trouble Above average pop filter,positive
Works Works as expected and should last a really really long time Glad I bought it Nothing else to say Thanks Love it,positive
I have two of these for my acoustics and when I get another acousticIll be buying another one of these Nice quick release without having to tie anything I have one that is over 5 years old and still works like a charm These things are awesome,positive

I used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin It works fine and I would recommend them at this good price Great cheap tuner,positive
It sounds very artificial I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had now that I use it with a better amp it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that its not even worth the price I payed for it before I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didnt want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced Shitty pedal now that I use it with a better amp it sounds very processed and artificial in,negative
For the price this is the perfect pop filter really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile Perfect,positive
Perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyones pedal board Many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right Having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting The ditto is great for practice though Very small simple,positive
As a pro musician I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet give up on the thoughtWhen I upgraded my pedal board I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my GL American Legacy Stratocaster style guitar more sustain at lower volumes Boss is the company that dominates my effects board I rely on their Chormatic Tuner Digital Delay 2 of them Line Switch Direct Box almost every night for gig PracticeWith a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really really like this unit It did what I wanted then some Great tone sustain oozes from this little box stays in the On position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own Great Unit,positive
One of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track A pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs They can be configured as a masterslave setup with a single link cable a 14 inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per CM30 In reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficientThe low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ I have run both aRoland RD300NX Digital PianoandRoland VCombo VR700 The grand piano setting on the RD300NX sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the B3 emulation from the VComboI did a direct comparison with this against aMackie SRM150 525Inch Compact Active PA Systemand the sound of this beat it hands down Bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency rangeVocals through the channel with the XLR are adequate but not particularly spectacular Also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances That leads me to conclude that this is best for live performancesI use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box That is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you However once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instruments volume and EQ controlsThere are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand First the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the CM30 to the floor not exceed 43 inches I agree This may be relatively small but its heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high Its easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended Can be used as a main and has a lot of power,positive
I have another headstock tuner that Ive had for awhile This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky but the tuner works like a champ Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions Compared to my other tuner its rigt on the money The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room I dont have to take the tuner off Neat,positive
Used on my acoustic guitarProRemoves friction for faster playing I noticed immediate result after applying first timeEnhances string life and tone Strings sound brighter now I guess there was some mild crud buildup you cant seeReduces finger noise Not completely gone but lessenedEasy to use applicator Wide applicator makes it easy to put on and not get it onto the fret boardConPackaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks Has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesnt prevent dry outI dont believe I would buy again until a sealed container is provided Works great but needs a better container,positive
I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were Finally I just went with this one and Im pretty happy with it It seems quite servicable It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just dont bump it I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stifferI can blow on it directly not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my micSo then Im gonna keep it and use it till it rots or gets lost Good Unit Does the Job,positive
star rating based on price great for home use but dragging it on the road i dont know how long it would last you can put your guitar on it man,positive
Not much to day its a polishing cloth it cleans your guitar and it does it right Good price too nothing to complain about Gets the Job done,positive
Cool little light but three minor gripes 1 the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible 2 the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy and 3 the light is a little on the dim side But I think itll work well overall and I like the fact that its so compact and portable Couple of quirks but overall a solid light,neutral
It has what you want in a cable and not what you dont Not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends So there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable Very nice cable,positive
This is my third circuit breaker cable I play in church and no one wants to here the POP if I have to leave the sanctuary Why three 10foot 15foot and 20foot depending on the setup for the group I hate cable jump rope I really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand I use quiet get away,positive
For the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck My daughters love this amp and works perfect Product is as described Best amp,positive
I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting its EQ Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to 34bassy34 and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little I really didnt expect much since this pedal was so cheap and for a brand new one at that I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids If youre looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar Id recommend this Insanely good pedal,positive
This arrived a week sooner then expected I am very happy with this bag my Fender LH San Miguel Acoustic guitar fits perfectly It is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry Perfect fit,positive
Great value Using it as a back up stage mic Sound very good and for the price it cant be beat It does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics but gets the job done when needed Great Back Up Mic and Great Value,positive
Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges The strings were hard to slide unslippery and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didnt like Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes Gstring snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off Gstring snapped,negative
It winds It cuts You really cant go wrong here Another really wellmade product from Planet Waves that will become an indespensable part of your guitar setup Genius Design That Should Be In Everyones Guitar Arsenal,positive
I really dont see how Gibson can make and sell these for 99 The tech at the guitar shop cant see how either I plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects I was really surprised to see how well they sounded Im not a guitar player so this uke is just a toyexperiment for me If you are really into electric sound I recommend going the guitar route If you just want to play around a little this uke will do Such a deal,positive
I hate winding strings I got this to help with that It does it job very well You can string your guitar in a fraction of the time It could be a little tougher but as long you dont give it hell it will be fine Great and cheap product Very good,positive
you really have to have a lot of wind inside you to play these harmonicas they are great but you really got to blow hard to get them rocking adding distortion to them helps to brings out a better sound live or in the studio These fit my budget and plus you get EVERY KEY you need for any songWOW Hohner has been around forever well constructed instrument and very reliable company BLOW HARD,positive
This is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money Mine has the older paintjob with the monkey on it which makes it sound infinitely better IMHO lol This is intended to be used with a tube amp to achieve breakup and it does that job very nicely Those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere You cant blame a chicken for not quacking properly It plays nicely with other pedals and can be used to boost another dirtbox for when youve reached the part of Freebird that weve all been waiting for The build quality is decent for the price and it claims true bypass thought I havent looked under the hood Regardless of whether its TRUE or buffered it doesnt color my sound when its off Truth be told I kind of prefer my Behringer TO800 tonewise more of a personal preferance in the way I prefer Pepsi to Coke but still drink both but the TO800 pedal isnt true bypass and the build is much more flimsy on that one I think that if you are addicted to ODFUZZ boxes like I am you should grab one of these for your toolbox If you arent a hoarder of dirtboxes but you are just looking for a very nice tubescreamer on the cheap you cant go wrong with this one You can handpaint the cover with an owl or whatnot and tell your corksniffer bandmates that you spent an arm and a leg on it They will be none the wiser I think enough of this pedalcompany that I just ordered the JF02 OCD clone and will probably grab the Octive Fuzz when my wife isnt looking though if one more pedal comes into the house this month I may be strangled in my sleep very nice,positive
The fourway diagram that comes with the switch does not tell you which side to use Both sides have five tabs and look the same from the above diagram given no matter which way you turn it I figured it would go the same way as the threeway wrong You think Fender would have the sense to figure this out and give us a proper diagram but guess again Just another example of the incompetence at Fender Improper Wiring Diagram,neutral
Nice to use to muse your violin A must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing Great buy Good mute,positive
I bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it After a month of using those strings I decided to replace them since I was having trouble keeping the low E string in tune I put these strings on and compared to the 34default34 strings it was almost silky and softer by comparisonIm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel The sound was much nicer to my ears as well They were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar These felt silky compared to the strings that came with my guitar,positive
who cares if they were used or hanging around the warehouse hey they went together and dont show any wear and tear to melove themthanks very fast service,positive
This product isnt really one to review but it does what it advertises I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU3 great tuner by the way Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a TRex fuel tank which Im planing on in the future Great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks Cant beat it Does what it does,positive
I opened the package for the first time and didnt think much of it but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job Obviously cardboard isnt going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths What do you want for six bucks,positive
These are as described these work with fender switches which turns out they include those screws and fender pickups Used them while building a few prewired pick guards Screws for pickups and switches,positive
Its just unbelievable how well this device holds picks I mean you just insert your guitar picks in this device and BAM it holds them No further action is necessary And when you need a pick you just pull one out and there it isWhat will they think of next INCREDIBLE,positive
This strap looks better in person than on the computer It has a nice soft feel and doesnt scratch the neck like the belt straps do and the color goes well with a varity of instrument looks and colors Nice soft strap,positive
I thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big It really doesnt affect play at all so it doesnt matter big,positive
This one is probably closer to a 150 guitar The fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day its just like most of the other made in China guitar From the reviews I was really hoping this was some great gem for only 200 but Im not at all impressed One thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis which usually means theyre a jack of all trades but a master of noneI recently bought a Johnson JG610N a Johnson JG620N a Bristol BD16 a Jasmine S35 and this Yamaha If Id only played the Yamaha Id probably think it was a pretty nice guitar but having tried all of these sidebyside I can definitely say its not at all amazing The Bristol blows this thing out of the water and not just because its 50 cheaper it plays and sounds better The Johnson guitars both have a little higher action not a lot of highs and a cheaper fit and finish The Jasmine is nice but I havent spent enough time playing it to give a true reviewThe Yamaha FG700GS is definitely neat to look at and has decent mids but doesnt really have a great high to low end punch Now it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body but the sound range overall wasnt great The Bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison Also the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the Yahama though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the sameCant help but think that the reviews here are a bit hive mind where everybody buys into a hype Maybe I got a dud guitar but I doubt it theyre all made in the same factory I dont like it,negative

This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back At full price of 1699 it is a solid deal Any lower and it is a steal Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online You cant feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing and every piece of leather is different Most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for This one appears to be an exception to that rule But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching you need to understand that youll have to pay more If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide youll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that wont let you down this is a safe bet Oh and tight strap button holes Thats a good thing in my universe as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel on this Planet anyhow Solid quality for very little money,positive

You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and its predecessors the SM7 and SM5Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multitrack studio work Ive used over the years the Sennheiser MD421 EV RE20 EV RE27ND Shure SM7B Shure SM7 Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR40 Sometimes this was not of my own selection but I just used what was available Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5 I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasnt been in production in ages I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7BTodays SM7B is the best noncondenser vocal microphone still in production Stop looking and buy one You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word It has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the EVs I can play a SM7B like a violin the others I just dont seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impactEverything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isntDJs change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 RE27ND mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went so I bought my own SM7B I never liked the EVs or Sennheiser much and didnt ever feel like they were much of a tool The Heil PR40 is pretty good but doesnt have any onboard EQ options For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you cant do much of thatThe SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27ND but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work The others are more versatile but the SM7B is THE VOICE microphone and that was all it was intended to be It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphoneOf all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably That is one reason vocals sound good on a 4000 tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multifrequency overtones of the human voice Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didnt intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise If you are doing a dry voiceover you cant hide the hiss of a condenser under something else With the SM7B you dont have toEven for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves Recording Engineers today are usually totally ignorant about They figure anything short of a multithousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrongIf you want a good all around microphone this is NOT it If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear Ive ever connected to it I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers Most real studio preamps are a good match for it Ive plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too You need at least 60 dB of gain the spec sheet actually says 59 70 dB would be better Lots is made of the LOW OUTPUT of 59 dB but it isnt all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is 545 dB 45 dB isnt much at all for any decent mic preamp But again most of the oneboxsolution USB interfaces with builtin mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mindThe Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens It has a nice metal case for storagetravel I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and Id suggest getting one of the RK345s but that is the only accessory youll need to add The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged They are also very durable for foam screensOn the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for FlatBass RolloffPresence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best You can just leave the plate off if you want This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamicSo Im just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didnt want to actually buy one I still am an SM7B guy I would give it 45 stars but it wont let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic The Best Vocal Dynamic Microphone Still In Production,positive

Width and padding are good for Heavier guitar currently being used on a Les Paul Finish stitching and adjustments are qualityThe only issue I had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegsYou might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in placeBut that means the guitar is very secure so I am very happy Excellent strap,positive
Love these strings I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly I have a washburn with a glossy sealed looking fretboard that doesnt have that problem but still prefer these strings for it as well They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie balls but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands Great corrosion resistant strings,positive
Great quality casters for the money Just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps You cant go wrong with these Great deal,positive

If you want an inexpensive pure nickel string get theDR Strings Pure Blues Pure Nickel Wrap Round CoreThey feel nice are nicer to your frets sound smooth and mellow for the blues or any genre They bendnicely and sustain just as wellI know guitar strings can be a personal thing and there are more expensive pure nickels out there butat this price point try a set of these as well You may be surprisedI have rated this set at 4 stars because only after about 16 hours of practice the D string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my Gibson Standard No damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull almost dead StrangeI recently went electric again after 20 years So electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again That said I never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over 30years of playingI put another set on my electric and have had no further problems I have not heard of this happeningto anyone else Maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on itUPDATE 07142013 I am still using DR Blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthemUPDATE 01082014 I just had the D string windings break on a new set Different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above DR Pure Blues Pure Nickel,positive

I play guitar I bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago Theyre very interesting These are soft rubber with a little bit of give so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies similar to using your thumb but not exactly I still pull one of these out every once in awhile In certain applications getting a particular sound for a song say these could be exactly what youre looking for Overall these are well made and the ones I bought will probably last me forever but these would never work for me as a main pick Im glad I tried them though as I have nothing else remotely like them Not bad at all but not for me,neutral
I think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class Yup it is I would buy again My use is to hold my books while I try to teach myself how to play guitar This stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about 234 high Very happy with itJust a warning to those that are picky Because of the way the tube locks together the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it Not an issue for me but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and wont moveIt would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy Buy it youll like it It will survive a nuclear blast Nice Stand Heavy Duty and Quality,positive
Ive been using Nanoweb and Polyweb no idea what the difference is Elixirs consistently for years now on my Martin Jumbo CutawayI periodically try out other brands whenever I see something that might compete especially when another extended life or coated string is released I would happily bail on Elixir at 13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well In fact I was quite optimistic about the 9 DAddario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string Nothing that Ive used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple boxThe sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected Thats not where Elixirs kill the competition though Its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength You will still hear fresh bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone In fact I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull I play relatively aggressively and use palmmuting constantly allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridgeSaying that the tone lasts 35x longer as stated on the box might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternativesIf you are an occasional player or a music shop owner these are a nobrainer The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure For the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer lifeOne nitpicky point of criticism the packaging is an issue for me WHY would any manufacturer still utilize treekilling paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale Im seriously asking Ive got to be missing something here A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener more costefficient and it keeps the strings fresh thank YOU DAddario Ill never leave your electric strings I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelflife Complaints about these snapping prematurely are probably valid happening when someone gets a set thats been sitting around for a while Think of them as a perishable and buy them from places that move a lot of units like Amazon Nothing Beats The Lifespan Of Elixirs,positive
I love that these eliminate pick noise but dont expect to use these on your electric guitartheyre simply too fat at 311mm They work well on bass and acoustic however Dont go with the Soft versionthey have too much give and tend to stick to your strings and leave you without a pick Go for Medium or Hard on these,positive

I started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked but when I tried to add a secondthird stomp box I couldnt get any guitar sound only a loud buzz I returned this product I did further testing I would not recommend it to anyone With my personal experience in mind I would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply hope this helps Visual Sound One Spot MultiPlug 5 Cable,negative
This is a pack of guitar strings It sounds good on my guitar and its not that expensive I like it4 star rating according to amazon I would rate it 5 starsamazon rating for 5 stars is if you love the productif it made me sound like Clapton unfortunately none of the gear that I bought can do this Also I kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings like the strings,positive
Not bad but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument I bought a few for different basses and guitars But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag no problem with hard cases leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit FWIW I like my Snarks betterfaster and more stable tuning A near miss with the NS NS Mini,positive

Ive relied on this stuff for years and it has yet to let me down I play my guitars quite frequently and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat etc during a show A couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self with zero degradation to the finish Ive even used this on matte or light finishes with good resultsTip a little goes a long way I play every week I use this stuff every time I put away a guitar and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle I figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month Does the job without damage,positive
You wont get AC tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your Amp Sorta like buying a Wah flanger or other product this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone Problem is is that you wont replicate a Vox sound found on a classic rock album because what you are producing is a unique sound I have yet to try this through a loop Good bang for the buck,positive

These strings have a tonal quality that will change your life if youeve ever wondered how the greats such as Wes Montgomery George Benson and Larry Coryell have been able to get their awesome mellow tones Id recommend this even to metal players as a change of pace as they may get something out of it that theyve never considered before Obviously this takes someone who is willing to give a change to their accustomed style of playing a try Trust me Ive been playing professionally for decades and I can say that theres no way Id turn my back on these as a jazz enthusiast Also if youre interested in saving the skin on your fingers this product will help as I havent even come close to the normal amount of skin shedding experienced previously on roundwounds So Great,positive
So I ordered this to learn to play the banjo because of the price and good reviews It was delivered yesterday and the first thing I noticed was that the neck was loose and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board I looked to make sure it wasnt warped or cracked and it wasntSo I scoured the internet to find my problem and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot So I took the resonator off and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body and naturally that scared me but I tightened the metal rod and it brought the neck down to the body and brought the strings down to the perfect heightNow its a very beautiful instrument and it sounds pretty good too Granted Its not a Gold Tone or what have you But it sounds atleast like a banjo that costs 23x this much The only thing I would change is the tuning pegs as they are made out of a cheap plastic they dont feel like they will break any time soon though I just prefer metal tuning pegs the part that holds the strings is still metal Im talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plasticSo Im debating on rating it 4 stars or 5 stars Id rate it 4 because of the scare it gave me at first but I think Ill rate it 5 stars because of its looks sound and price Yes the reviews are right guys dont be skeptical But be warned that you may have to do a little TLC on it as I did with the neck No worries though Now Im learning my new favorite instrument Also the strings that came on it are pretty decent but new strings sound a bit better Some problems but easily fixed,positive
this thing plays great action is low but does not buzz very easy to chordi highly recomend this guitar WOW,positive
I bought this as i had already purchased tow other Joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was aboutThis phaser is perfect I do not use a dramatic effect more or an EVH setting for leads This pedal is 998 sounding like the MXR I never give anything a 100 This is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price I am done thinking a good pedal must cost 200 and above This was like 35 and sounds awesome Rethink what you need to spend buy this pedal,positive
I was not happy with the sound of these strings The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny For an extra 2 I bought the DAddario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G60 Spend the extra 2 its well worth it You get what you pay for,negative
I really liked this one I bought the Crunch Distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone I very much like how Joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced boutique pedals I will continue to buy these products from Joyo until I find something wrong with them and at present I have nothing to bitch about at all here Sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound As an example this is the JF02 and JF03 on guitar and the JF03 on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a Line 6 SpiderBuy thisthese pedals and all things from Joyo they are worth every penny Nice Heavy Distortion,positive
These are the thickest picks Ive ever used However I am really liking them The tone they give seems better to my ears than anything Ive tried and my speed picking has improved Very Heavy Pick,positive

This is my first mixer Id been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USBpowered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and of course that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookupsThus I am an amateur and youll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professionalAnyway my pros and consPros1 This thing is way smaller than I expected I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesnt take up a lot of desk space It fits well where I put it2 It works as intended I use this with a GLS ES57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60 I have no hissing and no problems I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast cohost we do it over Skype said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball3 Its plug and play I plugged it in it installed the drivers and it automatically set itself as the default microphone Easy peasy4 I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately5 The dials and everything was easy to understandCons1 You cant plug this into a USB hub or even an ACpowered USB hub otherwise youll get a hiss This needs to be plugged directly into a computer2 This highjacks your audio defaults in Windows To fix it open your Control Panel open the Sound and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended Since I use this as my main mic I left it as default in the Sound settingsOverall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and Im on a budget Its a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money If youre like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person Worth every penny as long as it lasts Ill update whenif it breaks down but until then I do not regret this purchase Nifty little guy,positive
Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find And they tune with amazing accuracy If this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better but theres already another model for that In one way its better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while youre tuning so this tuner is a pretty good choice Does the job right,positive
I wish I could say that they let me play more like Frank Zappa but only practice can make that happenThese are solid picks they dont break apart theyre easy to hold and they work exactly as a pick should work and at a good price Whats there to say really except that theyre good picks,positive
I take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile but it always finds its way back in Unlike Kaga I put it at the end of my chain right before a Boss Line selector for multiple amps I used to put it at the beginning of my chaing during my metal days and it does well there too Im more blues orientated now and love it at the end With my fuzzes I can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth then at the end with the EQ I got it jacked up Unlike most people I love a bass players V on my EQ I love that bass but I play through 10s and 15s and those speakers handle it better than 12s although I do have a 2x12 with V30s in it and it sounds nice This is a must have pedal though no matter what you want your sound to end up like if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone you got it with this thing Buy it worth it,positive
Has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place Easy to reach and nice to have on hand Easy to use,positive
very good pedal for the price I have bought other behringer pedals that work very well will be buying more from them nice piece,positive
It is sturdy well made feels hefty in your hands with an extremely smooth action everything the Shubb winder is notWell it is made in China while the Shubb is made in USA But what is the point if it is so much inferiorI think it proves that it is not about where it is made but how it is designed and manufactured So much better than the Shubb,positive
The power supply which is not included is a funky size it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but I wouldnt recommend it only because it is not the proper size The guy that was using this was using it with a Fender Telecaster and a single 1234 tube amp He found that the volume was cut by 1520 even with the pedal turned all the way up Any time a pedal allows for volume loss it tends to effect tone yes Mr Sound Engineer 34tone34 is a real thingThe pedal is pretty bulky and wont fit well in most pedal boards but its not any more wide than the Morley but it seems to be taller longer and heavierI gave it 3 stars because 34Its Okay34 but it is far from great and I would not buy this product again I understand the price is cheap and if this is all you can afford then go for it but if you have the extra cheese spread it Not well designed,neutral
I am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment Paired up with a nice pop filter this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings Youd be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic It took me some time to get the hang of miking amps positions and vocal distance but I am truly getting more than my moneys worth for what its putting out Check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing I am very glad I made this purchaseIve owned this mic for 2 years if youre curious about durability Ridiculously cheap for the quality,positive
Summary for those who dont want to read the whole thing This is more than worth the money If youre a beginner looking for a first guitar or if youre experienced and are searching for a backuptravel option or anything like that get this Do not hesitate A cheap guitar doesnt ALWAYS mean a POSAlright full storyreviewSo when I was a kid up until my early teens my insanely talented and selftaught older brother helped me learn how to play guitar I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and Ive regretted it basically every day ever since then Recently I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it So here I amHaving previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars like a typical beginners First Act I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it I got way more than I bargained forI began my quest knowing that my funds were limited There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day I knew I had to go cheap at least for now I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars After an exhaustive amount of research I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos Id pulled up on YouTube were excellent Plus Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in generalDespite the positive reviews I was still a bit leery buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble Even if it sounds nice and plays well sometimes a perfectly solid functional instrument just doesnt FEEL right As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility Id just have to bite the bullet and buy something better even if costlierWell it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed I certainly didnt expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error if only cosmetic with such a cheap guitar I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it Even if I had unless it drastically affected the soundplayability of the instrument it would still be worth the priceAlong with the guitar I bought some new strings Martins because 910 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable I see that some of the other reviewers disagree Maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference I dont know All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corrodedold Shockingly enough the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box It doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either All of that being said it wouldnt hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe I mean Im sure that when I do finally put the Martins on Ill be even more mindblown than I already am with the way it soundsThis guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets Oh and contrary to what other reviews have said YES it DOES have a truss rod While were talking about its positives lets not ignore the fact that its also super attractive with its shiny black finish There isnt much about it that would give away its price No its not a 1000 guitar but it certainly doesnt play like a 100 guitar either I dont regret this purchase at all Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gemIf youre still unsure do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube I doubt youll be disappointed Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did He clearly doesnt know what hes talking about and I as well as everyone else in the comments section was sure to express my feelings about that haha One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him Check out the video reviews by the userscompanies GoldHat3 SamAshMusic GigGear and ShadowFWMy only complaint about this guitar is that I didnt buy it soonerGood luck on your search I hope this review has helped This will more than suffice,positive
Cable would be OK If the end connections would stay screwed together Maybe some lock tight would help These connectors worry me The end connections are not the best,neutral
its 6 bucks so I didnt expect a lot from it but it works as advertised not sure how long the connectors will last though as they do look to be lower quality the cable wire is rubber coated and is easy to roll and store the wire is very thin okay build quality but works,neutral

Im primarily a guitarist but I keep an inexpensive SX bass around for when Im selfrecording and whatnot Since it isnt my primary instrument and I dont play bass live well not yet it never made sense to invest in a bass amp I bought this to liven up the tone when recording in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface It does the job makes the sound warmer and more amplikeHonestly if youve been doing some homework about this thing you should know what to think of it Behringers build quality can be dubious sometimes but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isnt a picky audiophile This box is no exception Ive never personally played through a SansAmp but I would hazard a guess that if you KNOW thats what you want this wont satisfy you If you want something LIKE a SansAmp you could do a lot worse than venture the 30some bucks on this little boxTo my ears it sounds quite good Get it if it fills a need for you and youre broke Knocked off a star for Behringers usual build quality although mine hasnt broken from gentle use yet Well what are you expecting,positive
I am starting out learning to play guitar I wanted a way to record myself playing guitar onto my laptop so I could go back and listen and to also play both lead and rhythm parts and mix them togetherAfter asking a few questions on a message board the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 was recommended to me Its pricier than some of the options I was considering but given the reviews I figured it was worth taking a chanceIm glad I did The Scarlett 2i2 is a piece of cake to set up even for a guy like me thats pretty PC savvy but never dealt with external recording devicesIm running Windows 7 64bit and everything installed flawlessly The drivers loaded without a hitch and immediately recognized the Scarlett when I plugged it inThe included Ableton Live 8 Lite software recognized the unit as wellIm looking forward to using the Scarlett more to improve my guitar playing So far Im very happy with my purchase even if it was a little more than I initially wanted to spend Excellent product and easy to use,positive
I retubed my Carvin X60 combo with a duet of Mullards and 3 of these EH preamp tubes Wow they all come to life and make the amp sizzle The price was right from AMZ What I needed,positive
cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use Still highly recommended for the money good tone,positive
I wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself I wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isnt my thing I played it all but 2 weeks until I got bored and stopped It now sits on my amp collecting dust I pick it up occasionally but I always end up putting it back down shortly after I am sorry I just cant dig it Edit So apparently a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post Normally Id just laugh at these nolifers but I am sick of getting constant emails from internet tough guys so Id like to formally state that this is not a bad product It can be fun but the effects it gives are not worth 100 and its build quality is not worth 100 Like I said in the original post I became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed The last time I picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout active pickups on my schecter Its not that I didnt know how to use it like one of the morons in the comments section stated this product requires very little skill to use Read the manual if you are having trouble it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this deviceWould I recommend it If you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it If not your money is best spent elsewhere Sadly it truly is just a novelty item,neutral
Ive owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk For the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the Spectraflex Ive regularly rolled 100pound half stacks over them jumped up and down on them and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements and they stay clean and work like the first dayPros Proper shielding means this is a quiet accurate cable Slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle Very flexible Metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen Available in some very cool colors Lifetime warrantyCons None to speak ofSpend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today A lifetime warranty means youll have it forever The best value in instrument cables and they look cool to boot,positive
I play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes I previously used a Fender Acoustasonic Jr and I got tired of lugging it about 50 lbs and all of my other gig equipment around With the CM30 I can get it 12 lbs mic stands music stand mic and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel That means I can haul everthing I need in one trip A big plusI like the sound quality I get My guitar is an acoustic Alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a Shure SM57 The Roland doesnt have a huge amount of volume but if youre looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport set up and take down this is a good choice If I used it a with a passive guitar pickup Id want external preamp Think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living roomIm also thinking I will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my Acoustasonic JrIt looks really rugged so Im looking forward to years of happy use Mighty Mite PA,positive
The EXH Hot Tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint I had no knowledge of or experience with the original fullsized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970s And frankly many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier Really though if you think about it doesnt EVERY overdrive pedal including the venerable Tubescreamer make that same claimWhen I plugged into the Hot Tubes I was surprised but immediately intrigued I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive which was very good but also a very 34familiar34 sounding clone of a TS808 What the Hot Tubes does is anything but 34familiar34 from an affordable OD pedalThis pedal has a significant amount of output and unlike many other overdrives it has considerable low end In fact it likely even adds bass to your sound There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand Basically with the switch off there is no tone control and they advertise this sound as 34powerful34 and touchresponsive Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things however I actually left it in the 34on34 position and worked the tone from the 1200 to 130 settingsThe gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp From the 700 0 setting up to around 1200 your tone basically remains clean provided you started with a clean signal My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2 which is a tubehybrid amp with a great clean 34Blackface34 setting However the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime but the Hot Tubes offered a thick smokey tone that was mostly clean with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into itAs you start get past 1200 on the overdrive knob the amount of gain increases exponentially At this point the pedal behaves more like an overdrive though the gain is almost fuzzlike Some people have described it as a 34Jack White34 type of sound but Ill really leave it to individual users to decide if they 34like34 it or notThere are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about First I want to make clear that this is a DARK bassy pedal In that respect it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive both of which have some measure of bass drop The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit but it could do more I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side you may want to stay away from this pedal That being said I would definitely recommend 34try before buy34 with this one because it is different in hardtodescribe waysFor now my rating is 5 stars solid EHX construction very compact accessible 9V jack on the top where it I like it and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesnt sound at all like the other overdrives I have It certainly wont be for everybody but so far I like what I hear Reissued vintage circuit somehow stands out as unique overdrive,positive
Wow I will never buy another SM57 again I cant believe Im writing this but its ture I am so psyched that I found this microphone its perfectBut seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me In fact and it might just be in my head but I now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp But everyone else has talked about sound so I want to talk about build qualityIts solid has some weight to it and the plastic at the top feels exactly right so far it hasnt come loose in the way that SM57s do If I handed this and a SM57 to my grandma who doesnt know any better shed probably guess that the ES57 was a bit higherend I continually look at it and cant believe I only paid 30 for itGet one Nah get a bunch Sell your SM57s for 60 and turn them into two of these Magic Meets or exceeds expectations in every circumstance,positive
This helped me a lot building my pedal board actually think its kinda overpriced but its really really goodI have 2 of these actuallyI recommend this product Excelent,positive
Any product that can make an intermediatelevel player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment The RP255 is an amazing processor loaded with features looper drum machine tuner and dozens of cool presets Greasr is my favorite You can customize your own sounds but I still havent gotten tired of Digitechs choices The AC adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun I live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential I run my iPod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes sweet The control settings can be a little daunting at first but the owners manual will walk you through the tough stuff Bottom line a great toy Sound investment,positive

I bought this EQ pedal to use with a 70s amp project I replaced the speaker and needed some mids so I bought this pedal to use for a clean channel The EQ and boost works great for being a plastic box I have seen the FC be called pure gold in a plastic box on a Telecaster forum and read reviews all over the net saying the same thingThe EQ works wonders for tone and is priced less than its MXR and Boss counterparts I am not going to rehash all the other reviews but I use it with a bassguitar amp and it works surprisingly well with the old amp and a passive bass The boost combined with the 2 low bass EQs works wonders for low endI use a Boss GE7 EQ pedal with a different amp and the FC works as well as the Boss as long as you dont mind the cheap construction from Danelectro I do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me I am wondering how long the switch will last though but at this price who can be criticalSome Danelectro pedals can be sorted into the novelty realm but this one is actually very functional and can open up all new sounds I also tried the EQ with a Telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end I hope this lasts as long as my old all plastic FAB distortion that I bought used for 5 great EQ for the price,positive
When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised It is a acdc Steve Vaughn kind of pedal Its got an attitude but it soft at the same time Its truly a one of a kind product I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal Make a note it is not a metal pedal Not by any means actually But for what it is it is fantastic Badass,positive
Im a very big fan of David Gilmour but never was a fan of GHSs So I thought Im wanting to step up one gauge to 10s so why not try these It took a little longer for them to get stable but My Strat and My Les Paul sound and feel Great Now and I didnt see this at first on Davids Les Paul He uses 105s and I have a Bigsby on Mine like His I may try those next time on My Les Paul Im not sure how they will work on a Epiphone Les Paul cause I have a Gibson and there is a BIG diference And on the MIMs Fenders either cause both of mine are American Standards All in all Im very pleased with the DG GHSs Their Great,positive
For those that dont know this pedal is a copy of the more expensive Line 6 Echo Park The two things that make it better than the real deal are the lower price and the IMO better tap tempo You have to do an odd sort of clicking sequence with the Echo Park but with the Echo Machine you simply hold down the footswitch for 2 seconds and then set your tap tempo When youre satisfied just hold again to enter regular onoff mode FoolproofSome folks will point to superior construction with the Echo Park and I wont totally deny that That said the effects modules and the construction of the Behringer pedals are basically the same plastic where youd like metal and surface mount construction practical maintenance is really only possible by the manufacturer But again there is a switch in the tone dock that requires maintenance at some point if it cant be cleaned up the dock becomes a paperweightAs best I can tell all the other settings are the same between this copy and the original That makes sense as it saves Behringer the costs of any RD they just had to make it fit in the dimensions of their enclosures and alter the tap tempo algorithmaccess Thats a win for the customer because it decreases the price For those who find a moral dilemma in buying a copy of something else Id submit that most of what is in your pedal collection has probably been either partly or wholly copied from something else Unless you want to restrict yourself to the known originals and the prices they fetch this is oftentimes the standard option If there is a worthy improvement IMO in a practical sense usually more than a sonic one it would kind of behoove you to insist on the original The tap tempo on the EM600 earns its purchase just like the lower noise floor of the Biyang Compress X earns it as a purchase over what it copies 11 the venerable MXR Dyna CompSo why only 4 stars Because its a 2way street the cost cutting means that this pedal will potentially be something for the landfill in years to come Theres no denying this and to get 5 stars requires unsurpassed durability at any price point Despite what you may think it can be done the flipside is an ever so slightly higher cost Behringer probably decided they preferred the increased profit per unit instead or didnt want to go above a certain price point and risk getting beat by direct competitorsThe other BIG reason to knock a star off is that with a little amp that you have to crank to get acceptable volumes from there is quite a bit of audible hiss from this pedal If all I used were my bigger amps I would have never noticed and it wouldnt have been an issue at all But the 21st century is a time of lower playing volumes in live settings which means the smaller amps are more popular So the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker It might be slightly lower than the PA youre using but I wouldnt be so sure Id say youd want a true 30 watt amp to ensure this isnt an issue but that may be absolute overkill for the gigs you playBut my aggravations are really small ones Overall this pedal works fine through any amp Ive tried it with as some are kind of picky especially with delay pedals Ive typically found digital delay to work better with driveODdistortion pedals as opposed to analog delay and this pedal is no different as much as I like my MXR Carbon Copy and BBE Two Timer they arent nearly as flexible This one IMO is on par with the flexibility of the old Boss DD2DD3 or Danelectro Dan Echo But it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects Many of those are something I would never use but I could imagine how others would absolutely love them Or they could come in handy for something specific or be great flexibility in the recording studioAlso worth considering is that at the EM600s price you could buy a backup or a 2nd one for different settings Very good especially for the price,positive

If you need a simple normallength strap this should work fine However if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side this is not what you need I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead Very similar look and feel but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist Again not a bad strap just not for us tall guys Decent strap not for tall people though,positive
Simply the best picks ever for Bass Recommended by Eric Friedman on a post and Im glad I followed the recommendation Cost Twice as much as Tortex picks so I use these Dunlop picks for gigs and rehearsal and use the cheapo picks for my finger exercises Best Bass pIcks I ever used,positive
Im really happy with the Black Ice Heavy picks 110 mm which I bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of Dunlop Jazz IIIsI would call the Black Ice picks medium sized They are roughly the same size and shape as Fender 551 picks but a little bigger than the Jazz IIIs They are stiffer than the 551s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the IIIs and thinner than the IIIs tooOne thing that may account for the nice way the Black Ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the 551s which I still like and from the Jazz IIIsIn terms of playability they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffnessBut the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you The tone I love the tone I get with these picks and the best I can do for you is to say that I was looking for a pick that would generate a solid mellow jazz tone with an archtop a tone that reminds me of say Barney Kessel but without Barneys chops of coursse This is what the Black Ice delivers Most of all I love the tone,positive
Works great as a stand for the ElecGuitar Work good in corners And I like it For starting out learning Work good,positive
I bought this guitar in 2005 It sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way I think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the valueThis model has the cedar top I love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars It is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that If you prefer the bright concert sound of a Martin then youll not want this cedar topYes this guitar has an oiled finish This allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded It also allows you to knock the heck out of it Funny thing is that after five years there isnt much damage just a little arm wear I think youll like this guitar enough to not knock it aroundThe neck feels silky smooth The frets are well placed and dont stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what youll get in other guitars in this price range Paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparingThis doesnt come with a case so I bought a hard shell by the brand name Canadian Great caseWhen I bought it it really didnt need an adjustment but I took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me Ive also taken it in every other year for setting the action checking and tweaking the neck and getting the frets polished I also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in Chicago Performing these tasks will prolong the life of your Seagull and your enjoyment of itUpdate 10132012 update of my 2010 review This guitar sounds even BETTER I went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic just for fun and I had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket To my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior You see I learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will open up and keep sounding better Yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of It will increase in value to you at least Best value at this price point or even three times as much,positive

Moen pedals are great Nice quality at an unbelievable price point This pedal is no exception It is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch to be fair I have not tried many other vibes Hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal That being said I am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere vibe is very Trower like Think bridge of signs Chorus is on the mellower side Very analog sounding not digital Replaced my BBE mind bender and fits the bill so much better Solid well built and should last I would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issuesMy only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect I read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal leds would fix the problem and indeed it did Its been fine since Despite this needed fix I would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if I needed to Great vibe pedal,positive
What a nice strap Its a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnoughtThe whole strap is leatherno adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument It took me a little while to get used to this method but now I dont even think of it The main strap has several slots cut into it and theres another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place Its simple and very secure It makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain but how often do you adjust your strap length once youve gotten it set I almost never doIts an affordable strap that looks elegant is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar has great length adjustment range and rolls up to fit in the case I had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitarI have a pickup system installed and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button Ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly I would buy it again Comfortable durable inexpensive nice color,positive
I had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy so i wanted something that would grip the iPad this stand does the trick I dont have to worry anymore about my iPad falling off of the stand Some people have said that its not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position I have not found that to be true Since Ive had the stand I have never droped the iPad out of it A lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic Because of the way that I stand with my guitar its hard for me to see the thing when I use the clamp kind This one uses the Mic clip treads and because its on its own stand I can put it anywhere at any height and see the iPad The only drawback is you cant have your iPad in a case Or you have to find a case thats ultra thin Otherwise its great Solid,positive

I use this on my mandolin it is easy to use once you have the trick of it first this thing has a long end with eyelets on it that the other reviewers fear will scratch the neck of their instruments and a short end designed to prevent said scratches To use place the capo on your strings with the short end facing you use your left thumb to hold it in place with the short end dangling just below your thumb next loop the long end over the back of the neck using your right hand to pull it under the neck and then up toward your thumb this will trap the short end under the long end and prevent the long ends eyelets from touching your instruments neck now just rotate your left thumb out of the way so you can buckle the strap in place and you are all setI prefer this capo over the other 2 I have because it is so tiny barely bigger than the first two joints of my pinkie and yet it does the job it was designed for its small size means I can toss it in my mandos hardcase storage box and forget about it till I need itThe only downside to this is that the elastic will eventually stretch to where it will no longer work but then again at 5 bucks you cant have everything Works on a mandolin too,positive
This was so inexpensive I couldnt pass it upI needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactlyFolds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag I just toss it in my gig bag and Im always ready Low priced kick mic solution,positive
Ive been playing guitar more than 35 years and have used a lot of electronic tuners The first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today But it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing Over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use The Planet Waves PWCT12 is my new favoriteIt is very small a little bit larger than a grape Despite some of the other reviews I have used it with good results on a Strat Tele Les Paul and ES335 electrics and on acoustics from Martin Gibson National Resophonic and Voyage Air I clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the lowE tuner I didnt expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing Previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock Small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock I have to read it upside down The PWCT12 is nicely out of the way even when I play an F chord with my thumb on the low E string Its so light I dont notice its thereThe display is bright and easy to see in most light A bit hard to read in direct sunlight but I do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway The display is small a dime can cover most of it but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position The sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it No flat symbol Bb is displayed as A The tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer The display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning Its red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune for example E I found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songsThese are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin Rough handling will probably break it I notice that the clamp is easily removed so Im guessing Planet Waves may sell replacements The clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it It is a ratchet rather than a clamp You press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck For this reason this is not a tuner to pass around Its meant to be left on an instrument Its small enough that you can leave it on in the case If you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better and larger choices It can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget Im going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitarsOther reviewers commented on accuracy If you want strobe accuracy there are better choices For that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display This tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary I havent had a problem except with guitars that have builtin intonation problems like old Nationals and they need tweaking even after a Peterson StrobeSoapbox especially if you are a new player do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear Try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check Learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than I have time to list Being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill People that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that if ever My New Favorite Tuner,positive
This is an interesting limited effect pedal I bought it mainly to use with my nonpedal steel guitar On a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells However I play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedalsThis pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound Its sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works Since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings no chording this pedal works along with that technique I combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notesI tried this with regular guitar but its not the same For chords it does add an effect but its not very distinctive and for single notes it would depend on the song I havent really found many instances where its useful there either as I normally dont want volume swells for solos on guitar but on steel guitar it works very well Good for steel guitar,positive
It is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music I really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you It really helps,positive

Actually theyre not fender they are Schaller but that is really good Looks great in my Fender Squier Highly recommended Very beautiful straplock system,positive
This is not a gigging pedal You do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig so if youre planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the 50 on a Korg However if youre an athome player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners this is worth the price It sits right on the pedal board the signal flies through it when its off so theres no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and Drop D and its as accurate as the Korg is Its just also slow It takes a good 23 seconds to register a change which is fine when youre just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds arent crucial I just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs Perfect for athome use,positive

The Mustang 1 was a great buy for another great Fender product It has more bells and whistles than I can mention but its sophistication is lost on me I was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the Mustang it seemed thats all I was getting Great little amp just not for me Too much tech,positive
I bought this strap to use with an acoustic bass that is rather gargantuan A Tacoma 4 string after a bit of adjustment it worked great Then I bought an ovation 12 string roundback very roundback this is a deep dish I needed a strap to make this bad boy sit where I was so I grabbed this strap off the bass and gave it a shot After adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great Now Im buying another strap so I will have one on either guitarI usually keep a strap on all my guitars if the cases will allow it sure beats taking them off and putting them onThis strap is very comfortable on an acousticelectric guitar probably more so than on a bass as it is supporting less weight Due to the width of the strap it distributes the weight over a larger area meaning less pressure on any specific area This makes it very comfortableI might change all my guitar straps from 2 to 3 now that Ive had a taste of comfortIf you arent comfortable playing than you are distracted which removes you from the creative moment This helps keep you in the moment and in the groove and it dont cost a fortune plus it holds a pick or twoI like my phat strap just fine Phat strap for a comfortable jam,positive
I only have a lowcost Mahala ukulele so I wasnt expecting much of an improvement when I replaced the stock Nylon strings after watching several Youtube videos showing me how to do it I was wrong These strings sound much better the sound is much brighter and 34cleaner34 than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new The Aquila strings took about 30 minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods My ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers I would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better Sound great and are durable,positive
I frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously its a huge convenience Even if it doesnt save a WHOLE lot of time its very ergonomic Wish it had more speed variance but its great for the price 12 string owners rejoice,positive

Pretty much a straight up clone of the Boss pedal and a decent one at that Not the bulletproof construction of the boss to be sure but all the functions are the same This is not true bypass but neither is the Boss I have not experienced the tonesuck or buzzing that others have complained about Mine worked flawlessly out of the box and does a great job thickening up my leads in a Gilmour or EJ way Is this the best digital delay on the market Surely not but its the best cheap one The pedal features up to 2 seconds of delay and a tap tempo function however the instructions do not tell you how to engage the tap functionhold the pedal down Believe me you figure it out at this price point If you want to spend double the price 70 still cheap for a delay I would suggest the Ibanez DE7 Incidentally this pedal like any other digital delay or digital reverb will EAT batteries Its what they do and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal Invest in a daisy chain SPOT or the like If you have a pedal train with multiple stomp boxes and you are running them via 9 volt its a nobrainer DD5 Clone on the cheap,positive
I bought this sustain pedal for my iRig Keys Midi Controller I had an On Stage pedal square but that was crap This MAudio is awesome it doesnt move from where I put it on the floor it sustains the note how it supossed to and it feels very well So far its still working and it has a switch button to use with any keyboard I would buy it again Great sustain pedal,positive
Ok for the price Tuners old style not sealed PUP plate maladjusted and off quite a bit Id suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versionsOn the positive action and intonation good Better than expected Much better than most Chinese guitars at the same price level However Ive purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less That said youll probably do OKEpiphone setup and overall quality better than the Squier OK for Price,neutral
It is a good pedal It is not heavy and the price is good It is a good choice for a beginner Thank you Equalizer Pedal,positive
Good design good price smart locking mechanism great for classic accustic and light electric guitars Great choice,positive

This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments The strings last a long time in my opinion They keep their bright look and sound even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitarI have always liked DAddarios packaging Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge DAddario color codes the ball end of the string so the G is green the low E is brass I think Im doing this from memory the high E is silver and so on I really like that there isnt an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly Its a learning curve once you know the system its great but the first few times its a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes whereDAddario is my favorite string hands down after almost 40 years of playing My favorite string,positive

this is a good product its not the best strap but for what i paid for it its well worth it ive had it for about a month and so far it seems to be holding up very well this is a great product for a beginer planet waves guitar strap,positive
Behringer is a problematic company for me Some of their stuff has been useful far beyond its modest entrylevel pricing eg A500 Studio Amplifier UCA202 DAC Eurorack UB502 minimixerand some of their stuff hasnt served me well at all eg GM108 amplifier BTR2000 rack tunerAcross the Web reviews for the TO800 are uniformly favorable Based on this I purchased one instead of paying many times more for an Ibanez TS808 This proved to be a good decision The TO800 produces exactly the sort of sound enhancement that made seasick green justly famous creamy smooth to raunchy depending on my whimThe same sound for a lot less money Whats the catch Im a musical hobbyist The TO800 will sit safely on my office floor and most likely never be actuated by my foot The Behringers shoddy plastic case and flimsy little control knobs for me are not liabilities If I was a gigging musician on the other hand Id want the tanksolid construction of the real thing and its additional cost would be well justified The Real Deal A Pleasant Surprise,positive
The only reason Im not giving this one star is that I didnt expect much for such a low cost pedal I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals We have a punk ska band think suicide machines sublime and need to switch a lot in all our songs I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile NOPE This pedal sucks your guitars tone and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going and its not a pleasant sound either way AVOID Sounds just like it costs,negative
Ive been recording professionally for 27 years Music radio commercials and television mostly So Ill try to give you the information you need to make your purchaseIve owned and used so many mics and brands through the years I cant remember them all but I can I say Ive never had a bad AT 4033s 4050s and 4080s I use every week and have for years the 4033 going back to the mid 90s and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the AT family You have no idea the of recordings that youre hearing this brand on its used by almost every studio on every continent I work in the US Italy to Scotland and can attest to this But first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrongThis is a XLR connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best So it requires a phantom powered XLR input which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces Which you should really purchase along with this if you havent already because for around 100 youll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring youll find one by searching audio interfaces I have a RolandRoland TRI CAPTURE Audio Interfaceand a Focusrite I use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you dont need Avid HDs to get started Audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter Getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been SOP since the dawn of digital I see that small USB mixers are available which would be another option Dont try an adapter on it it wont work as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want It doesnt come with the cord what a surprise Quality cords will cost about half the price of this but a 15 version will probably do for mostIt doesnt come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like Work with it you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do Youll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeShure Popper Stopper Pop Filteris the usual but I can also recommend using 2 large 149 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen This isnt about being cheap there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and dont work at strange angles and youll probably always need one or the otherThis does not come with a stand so pick up a boom stand if you dont have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over 18 wheelers also tip overRecommendedUse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where theyve put a faux plastic one If its possible you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the wayMicrophone Flange Male For desktop users heres what Id do Using large Command strips and Velcro Id fasten this to the deskAdjustable Desk Microphone Standand attach thisTelescoping MiniBoomHeres another optionMXL Mics MXLBCDSTANDUnderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting if you need something figure it out your clean quiet recording is proof that it worksI cant justify comparing this to my 500 to 4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it 82 wouldnt have bought a case for most of my condensers It sure beats most non electret electrostatic DC bias or dynamic style mics The 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue Also individual mics have a sound of the eight 4033s I have I prefer 3 of them and use them the most So when reviewers say its bright I say compared to what I can tell you what it sounds likeKACHING a great sound in audio recording Uh huh I know of one professional recording its on and the client was clueless that I used an 82 mic Think about it would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago Have you heard good 70s recordings Anyone purchasing equipment because it sounds better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it Lots of reviewers have opinions about this mic so dont ignore them but ask yourself this do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities Any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost 400 and wont be half of what youll achieve by improving your recording techniqueThis type of mic is excellent for overhead acoustics amps or brass and of course vocals really most recording needs having a less uni and more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern its better suited to recording Just understand you cant get too loud near it or youll overdrive it since its designed for up to screaming vocals so back off with loud amps and brass which also means you need a quiet place for recording because itll pick up your AC ducts and your neighbors TV That is a good thing whats bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment so dont blame a mic for your extraneous room noise You cant just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind just quiet anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical rather than electronic signal to noise ratio A 10db pad will reduce output but doesnt affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam wont help thats not even its purpose I suggest reading this on acoustics and foam musictutsplus dot comtutorialsbeginnersguidetoacoustictreatmentaudio1274 just replace the dot Turn off your heatair be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 AM when the worlds a quieter place and that will really help youll likely hear how loud your computer fans are You can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions but you need quiet Ive known acoustic players whove worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing If this is what your budget allows for its an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost I keep saying this type of mic and the reason why is because AT sells 14 models like this style up to 3000 This model is the lowest priced but youre buying a reputable brand If your future plans include using only one mic without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware you can look hereAudioTechnica AT2020 USB Condenser USB MicrophoneOr hereAudio Technica AT2020USB Cardioid Condenser Microphone wPop FilterThis is not my advice you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface This model is not USBNow pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds I wont tell you because how it sounds to me on my system wont apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio descriptions are worthless only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters This is important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesnt the recording cannot sound better than the source so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone Accurate or inaccurate not good or bad theres a difference Its during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound Apply these same thoughts to your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than the recording and thats why accuracy is important in your monitorsSo search out any info you dont understand and dont expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling training and having worked in a professional setting If youre lucky like I was after 1 year of tech school I worked on site repair studios often need PT and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3 then after 3 years of work TV with another year of school I became a studio owner Real recording involves a facility equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital So study electronics acoustics the auditory cortex everything audio train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day it never stops When making any purchases I recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesnt mean youre educated in its use So yes I also dont recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother unlessBut everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording quit all that sleeping eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record Just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk I have So keep up the research because no man knows it all and Im just here to help you out If you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out Topping TP22 Digital Mini Amplifier Im Here To Help,positive
The stand works great It supports my Casio CTK6250 on the shortest level and can go pretty high as well This thing folds up so it is easy for storing It is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard This is by far the most stable keyboard stand out there and a great price too Keyboard Stand Review,positive
I have tried several different brandstypes of tuners in my 13 years of playing I have found that this model fits my needs perfectly It quickly detects the tune dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs and is extremely accurate It also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etcIt is also small and portable I have one in EACH of my 12 guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pocketspouches perfectly I cant recommend this tuner enoughAs always please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin Absoluely Love It,positive

First off Im a big fan of DAddario strings and their Planet Waves division So when I needed a quality cable with a right angle plug I got one of theirs I dont really know if its better than other brands or not But it does the job and its well made Just the ticket for guitars and basses with a front mount jack,positive
I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or Id end up with an audible creakHandsdown I like the Dunlop ones more They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure No problems whatsoever I just ordered my third set a few minutes agoIm a total convert every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it Like them better than my old Schaller ones,positive
While I dont have a ton of experience with pedals I really love this one Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain Although this is a tubeoverdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity For the price I dont see how you can beat this pedal I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome No complaints with this outfit Great Pedal,positive
Hi I need this item for travelling and it has work very well I am pleased I have purchased this little yet great product Great Product,positive
I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great Its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingersyou dont want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition Very sturdy and easy to grip,positive
It is strange how few fingerboard lubrication products there are that work well and dont build up stink or cost too muchI use this on all my households guitars and basses Works excellently application from this bottle is good though occasionally needs a stir and shake to get more lubricant on the applicator really nice fingerboard cleanrestore at good price,positive
This is a good stand Ive had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before and this one is definitely much sturdier It fits every guitar Ive put in it just fine and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck If you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up Great stand Definitely sturdier than others in the price range,positive
This little amp gives a warm and gritty sound Arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger Small footprint allows me to place in my studio and get that deep sound like a big tube amp Use a Shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing Recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue Really happy with sound Warm sound great amp,positive
Im using this as a DI box for recording It does some compression overdrive EQing notch EQing and exciteing all in one pedal So compared to the original bass signal you get this clear deep punchy sound that fits right into a mixThe Bass Attack sounds a lot like a SansAmp Bass Driver but at 13 the price One difference is that it has an additional Shape knob which is a lot like the ISF knob on Blackstar products and is a notch filter The other difference is that the SansAmp uses tougher chassis and components so would last longer for the gigging musician But dont take me wrong the Bass Attack uses a solid metal chassis and doesnt feel cheap at allThe Harmonics knob adds some overdrive and gets kind of farty when turned up 100 but sounds pretty good at 7590 It doesnt do that high gain super grittyfizzy distortion though for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output or duplicate the track in your DAW and add a distortion pluginThis pedal is very versatile I found that the Shape knob is indispensable it takes the place of a mid control For example by notching reducing the boomy 60130 Hz region and turning up the level you get plenty more mids The treble and bright control seem very similar to each other one seems to amplify the 4k region the other the 5k but thats just an estimate By keeping both of those around 10 oclock and the Shape control beneath 115 Hz I can get a solid deep yet midfull sound for a metal mix Thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids ought to try settings along those linesAnother good feature is that this pedal can run on 48V phantom power As in no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer In conclusion for recording you can duplicate the SansAmp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the Bass Attack and tweak it further via the Shape control And yes the various button pushes get you four different sounds total but I prefer having both buttons on Then in my DAW I only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great This pedal is a steal for no frills bass DI recording Awesome,positive
My Big muff PI with Wicker had hellacious noise I mean unusable I noticed it would change with movement so I pulled the back off and immediately found paint overspray where the grounding spring from the circuit board meets the inside of the housing After aggressively scraping the paint off the pedal operates as I would expect it toI really like the tone and aggressive drive of the big muff and the Tone and wicker switches are nice although I find that with the Wicker opened upON the noise level gets marginally too high so long as youre playing hard and loud its not really an issue This pedal isnt designed to be quiet when youre not playing so dont be fooled there it is normal for it to make some noise when theres not guitar inputstrumming The bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertisedIll be keeping the pedal and like it but the lack of QA from my proudly made in America fuzz pedal was a bit of a let down fortunately I found the problem and fixed it myself to avoid a return Good and bad poor QA noisy but awsome sound,positive
What happened to all the Korg tuners that had LED lights on it Dont get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to E flat much easier than on a non Chromatic tuner but thats ALL I use it for I prefer my older tuners that light up This screen is really dim and theres not a back light My guitar room isnt super bright and its very difficult to readGuess thats why the price is so cheap Its good wish it had LED lights,positive
This is a fantastic little capo I say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type of the Shubb capos Ive usedIt has a low profile and I can reach right up to it and still play wellIt seems to be sturdy and well constructed and I love that I can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings Just enough so they dont buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is offMuch cheaper than the G7th and does the job just as well in my opinionFor everyone saying that you cant fit it on the neck make sure you get the right capo If you have a classical guitar get a classical capo If you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo If you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks get the normal oneDont write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind Loving it,positive

I am forever meeting people who rave about this harp but had not tried one for myself until today It is a wonderful harp with perfect tuning easy bendability does not buzz or squeak and belies its reasonable sale price I went for the Key of Bb and love the tone the playability and the just right feel of the instrument For anyone not yet having a Special 20 I heartily recommend it beginner intermediate or advanced students or the performer on stage this harp is simply great I am not often surprised by anything but this harp surprised me it is not expensive at all and sounds as good as others I have that are four times the price I am a Hohner Marine Band Special Twenty convert I will get a couple more to add to my ever growing box of harps A wonderful harp,positive

Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos and its worth every single penny THis has a strong clip yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks It wont budge once you clip it and its low profile Made of metal it should last a lifetimeI took off one star only for one thing the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways Some other capos like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell BanjoUke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side away from me the player But it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones That said I can work around it and its a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes If one was to have large hands as I do not this interference may be even more of an issue to considerC ya Happy strumming Mahalo WOw wow wow for ukulele but one caveat,positive

I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue when I record a track either with the Audio Recorder or Guitar Amp screens in Garageband on my iPad 3 iOS7 the recording is great But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable Heres the other part of this I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband So I dont know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but Ill find out when the new one comes next week If it works correctly Ill update this review after doing a few recordings But I would say if youve just updated to iOS7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit you might want to hold off on that upgrade UPDATE Got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my iPad as suggested by a Focusrite support tech and STILL have the problem I discussed above So this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me If anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution please let me know Problem with iOS7,negative

Nice daisy chain If its bought along with the 1 spot adapter just make sure to avoid using all the connectors since it could overload the adapter and youll have noise problems and performance issues if you use 4 analog pedals connected as I do there wont be any problem I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesnt interferes with them I works just fine Good product,positive
Ive been playing the guitar since the 1960s so Ive gone through plenty of guitar stands Always found the hangingtype to be the safest most secure For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend Christ Community Church St Charles IL I decided to give them a look The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar Electric or Acoustic are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching denting It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it This is the only type of stand I prefer to use I do wish it wasnt made in China too much of our money goes to that country just my opinion The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever Hercules GS414B AG Guitar Stand,positive
the title says it all it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks also since these picks are smaller i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out you cant beat a dunlop jazz 3 when you want to improve technique,positive

I buy these for my son He loves the grip on them as they help stop them from slipping out of his hands He also likes the small size They last forever and dont break Strong Last forever if you dont loose them GREAT GRIP too,positive
this little guy has help me record with my Apogee One voices and amps to prevent airflow shock on diaphragm wanna have excellent recordings get one very useful,positive
Normal pickguard screws nothing special here You do get a nice amount for the money though so this is still a good if not great deal Good to buy for stocking up with just dont expect anything special because of the Fender name OK for what you pay,positive
My guitar originally came with DAddrio exp and they sounded good I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good but the finish was wearing fast This time I got a 3 pack of EJ163d light The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quicklyBut the sound is the problem Its terrible They sound very muddy Crisp tone distinction is just not there I thought light would be the better route but now Im not sure I purchased some others to try Also since a purchased a 3 pack I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings Not what I thought i would get,negative
Ive always used these dunlop picks Ive tried other ones like fender other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right Ive never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing give them a try if not youll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead great picks,positive
I bought three of these at the same time to replace some older straps that were starting to rip and fall apart They are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons Two out of the three I bought are still performing well but one of them quickly cracked around the hole where that the strap button goes through and will occasionally slip off Not a huge deal because that seems to happen with almost every guitar strap Ive ever bought a one point or another but it happened quicker with this particular strap I suppose unless I have strap locks there is no way around this 2 out of 3 worked well,positive
Exactly what I expected A quality tuner for a low price Very durable and gets the job done Great buy Great product for the price,positive
It was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin At least it wont fall off soon I just got another mandolin with no button and this strap has no way to attach to it Not the awesomest design,neutral
Ive been playing guitar for over 30 years both teaching performing and never used a pedalboard I used to carry the FXs in a briefcase and setup the ones I needed Im old school when it comes to these boxes I run compression wah overdrive superoverdrive delay reverb pretty much in that order Sometime I use a phaser or a tremolo I also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but dont use them much I currently have 8 pedals setup on this board I have room for one maybe two more The board itself is built like a tank and travels well The bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but I wouldnt take it on tour without a metal case I did go ahead and Velcro down all the pedals that I always use leaving a little room for add ins Be sure you want to Velcro down the FX chain because to get the best most secure it wont fall off the board when you pick it up off the floorI found that I had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal The Velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals Use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them Low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warnedBoss MXR Mod Tone and other high end well made pedals work best once set on the board You can run any number of power sources to it There is plenty of room for all my needed connectionsI leave the choice of that to you the readerAt the end of the day its easier for me to move my FX pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes Plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable Im very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it Pedaltrain 2 Pedalboard works for me,positive
If youre a Froosh fan like me than look no further These are the strings used by John Frusciante formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers These strings really are special They help nail his tone and are slick light feel and handle bends perfectly I use these on my 1962 Strat Reissue and they really compliment the stratocaster well Highly recommended for those playing bluesfunkrockPlus I mean come on John mother Frusciante uses them p The strings Frusciante uses,positive
So there are some people who review this as superb with no noise and just the best thing ever To be honest I have no idea where this is coming from I do get a good amount of noise static buzz that makes it difficult to use it when playing your guitar in a more quiet mode Also the sustain is not as good as I thought it would be and I had to do a lot of finetuning with my amp to find a satisfying setting works best with some additional reverb settingThat said for the price it is pretty good I do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic It is what it is a rather inexpensive compressor that does a pretty good job for that price Ok but not as good as expected,positive
its semisecure on carpeting or hard floor but all together I am pretty unsatisfied with this stand The bottom piece has no way to lock in place and although with the guitar on it it is more stable I am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsyI prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall This one Meh Not worth the purchase in my opinion booooooooo dont like the wobbly effect,negative
This is a superb tremolo pedal 1 Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect 2 Its very sturdyan oftennoted feature of BOSS pedals Further 3 its utterly easy to use 4 allows for both 9v battery and power supplyadapter operation and most important of all 5 it delivers beautiful tremolo Note It comes with a 9v battery installed but it does NOT come with a power sourceadapter If the price is more than youre willing to pay consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO This also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much soundmanipulation as the BOSS product its still quite good but the BOSS takes the prize I paid about 75 for mine and have zero regrets Superb,positive
I just recieved these in the mail today and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar Not much else to describe theyre fairly simple to use and theyre selling you 12 of them so I have a spare set now My original pegs were also white on an all black guitar so Im totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar I definitely recommend these for anyone that needswants black pegs for their acoustic or acousticelectric gutiar Better than the original pegs,positive
I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday Came very well packaged and with all the pieces I was very easy to assembly and looks great For the price you really cant go wrong with this guitar stand Works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar The added strap on the front ensures that your guitar wont fall off Padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected Great stand for the price FAST shipping,positive
Simple and easy to use easy to carry aroundLove it the display is cool and cant ask anything more Snark SN5 Tuner for Guitar Bass and Violin,positive
Ive been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking So far this is the one and I think my search is actually over Ive tried theJim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz Iii Ply Pkand that was close but this is the one These Davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers doesnt slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking Pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs I love these picks,positive
This mic is absolutely awesome It looks and feels SO high quality The sound is stunning It could be a tiny bit better for the price but Im absolutely pleased with it overall Best mic in this price range by far Amazing Im in love,positive
Ive stayed away from multieffect pedals for years because I spent more time messing with it then playing guitar I could never get the levels right The Boss ME70 is easy to use It sounds great 72 patches in all My current band does not even play that many songs Simply and easy,positive
even though i ordered largestill not fittingwill do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fiti do not have giant hands so large should fitbut not thisvery well madeheavy if thats what your looking forarrived on timebutgood luck heavy and does not fit,neutral
I was honestly skeptical before actually trying it The specs seemed as if it would support my very heavy very expensive handmade 1x12 cabinet and matching head It seemed the only design that would allow me to tilt back the pair and it absolutely delivered The upright support in the back extends quite a bit and the protective foam is moveable and can be positioned at just the right location I am truly impressed and after using this weekend after weekend with a gigging band can soundly recommend this product This is a GREAT stand,positive
SHIPPING The Epiphone comes wrapped in protective foam inside a gig bag which is inside a sturdy standard trishaped box which is itself shipped inside a HUGE box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic That huge box is then inside yet ANOTHER huge box Honestly to protect this better theyd have had to contact Tony Stark It would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping EXCELLENT job 5 stars on that alone SIZE Overall length 24 Fretboard 10 Nut to bridge 15 So good overall mediumsize I like that its a bit larger than a 2021 soprano uke It is concert size which I greatly prefer over soprano Frankly Id like to see a baritone version The 24 length is an excellent size for both adult and youth child fingers QUALITY From stern to port this instrument shines Beautifully lacquered flawless finish protective edging plastic fingerguard which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic solid neck screwjoined to heavywood body The whole unit is heavywood and very durable Nevertheless the sound is quite good The tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well The frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes The ampjack is chromemetal backplated to the body its NOT coming loose Strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle And of course the impressive EPIPHONE and LES PAUL signature stamps on the head for sheer class SOUND I found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box despite the fact its pretty solidwood electric I expected it to sound dull It doesnt But I still bought a set of dAddario strings a brand Ive loved for years and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added ACTION Ive rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception The action is fairly high not uncommon with offtheshelf instruments One will need to remove the strings keep them for emergency spares file down the bridge bottom easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper and add a new set of quality strings Im a perfectionist when it comes to action as are most players I know so this will be tweaked DURABILITY Its very durable That counts for the gig bag too No cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing As others mentioned Id still look for a decent hard case they average under 40 A good instrument is worth protecting But Id say this could take some real punishment and still play well not that Id go bashing it against a stage floor That would be goofy WEIRD SUGGESTION Hang on to the box it comes in It makes a great temporary hard shell case Its made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke Great for hauling around in your car if you cant shell out for a shell Seriously that is some stiff cardboard Protects well ELECTRONICS The sound is clear Sadly there is no volumetone control no battery to preamp and thus the signal to the amp was quite low They could have done better on that end But wow at this price how can one gripeTwo solutions to this1 Open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible Thats the tricky way2 Put a preamp on this You can buy one here on Amazon for about 15 bucks If you have a minimixer you can do the same thing with that Even with that little extra expense youll come out aheadAside from the passive electronics this is a PRIME instrument It is a midsize uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano if youre careful and dont tune it too quickly or a baritone guitar 4th 1st string Ehigh depending on the strings you chooseConsidering what you get for the price I dont think this can be beat Unfortunately my extralong fingers find this very difficult to play something I didnt consider when ordering a uke But thats a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument The product itself is excellent Just plain awesome,positive
I do own a few Behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range and this pedal will stay in my collectionIve spent 200 for a few of my pedals but I order and try many other pedals within the same effects range because some I believe are just to costly for what you get and the sound quality usually are not that far apartI would put this pedal in that category This is my 1st compressor pedal and while I dint think I really needed this type of pedal for the price I thought I would give it a try WOW The Behringer DC9 Dynamics Compressor Pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedalboard plus I get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set So I can go quiet on an apartment at late hours with a 100 watt amp thats niceSo I would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal My first Compressor pedal this thing stands up,positive
Header says it all Works well enough as a string winder but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me this did not work well at all Went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle As a string winder OK As a pin remover not so good,negative
PERFECT picks very pretty and nice quality They are not too stiff nor are they too soft I would order these again Picks,positive
OK so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists Ive been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick There is no 1 perfect pick for everything depending on what your playing and your playing style youll want to choose different thickness and materials However I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor I also really like the Nylon material It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar I like the playability of the 88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues I Keep a stack of 60mm for a more raw folk like sound In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be Simply great picks,positive
Item arrived as described and on time Way larger than expected but my son loved it Says its easier to use than the smaller cloths weve gotten before Fender Polish Cloth Untreated,positive
I use this as the first pedal that my guitar cable touches as it goes into the pedal board Its true bypass which means that the sound is not affected when its not in use When you step on the button the sound cuts out and you get the tuner It works as advertised My only complaint is that it could be smaller There are other smaller truebypass tuners out there if space is an issue on your board Ive posted a photo of this tuner on my board Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case If you need a smaller tuner I have buddies who use and like the polytune Great tuner could be smaller,positive
I had some issues with my 18watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes Issues not only continued but worsened Hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes I eventually put back the original El84s and that didnt help Once I removed the TungSol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced the hum stopped sound quality of the amp was consistent quiet and back to par My experience with the TungSol tubes was very very negative They caused me to go out and buy another amp I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast Ill never buy this brand again Very Unhappy with the performance and quality,negative
For those unfamiliar with Voxs amPlug products these things are amazing Im just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990s and they were mostly terrible What Vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers which weigh virtually nothing run for 1015 hours on 2 AAA batteries and plug directly into the guitar is nothing short of amazing They have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want Even through a pair of 20 Sony headphones they sound amazing The star of the collection in my opinion is the Vox AC30 amPlug which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to Top Boost overdrive If you havent played an amPlug before the AC30 one is 3999 of the best money youll ever spendNow getting to this specific Joe Satriani amPlug its impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself Fans of Joe Satriani even casual ones will recognize elements of this sound right away Satriani has a very distinctive sound which he crafted over the years using a modified Boss DS1 Distortion and more recently his Vox Satchurator Distortion Box Its a thick lead tone with a nice sustain and colored with a delay effect Both of those elements are present on this signature amPlug You have a level control a gain control and a tone control Theres also three switch positions Off On and Fx The Fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the samePROSFirst the price retails at 4999 whereas most of the other models are 3999 I believe the Lead amPlug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature I think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money but this is admittedly a sort of niche product Overall however you have several amPlugs to choose from and if you choose this one 4999 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone The tone has a real sweet spot between 3 and 5 that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes While it isnt necessarily and ideal rhythm guitar distortion you can hit rich chords with nice sustain I prefer the tone on the higher gain levels and you can really crank it up if you want to but it sounds great at lower volumes too The delay is also surprisingly good its probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap which is pretty standard Adds a cool echo fullness to your solo progressions much like a classic Satriani solo Again the overall tone is fantastic With the amount of gain provided you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit though Ive always thought of Satch of more a technical melodic guitarist than a metal guitaristCONSThere are a few things to know about the Satriani signature model but I dont think any of them should discourage you from checking it out While the delay is surprisingly good you cant customize it You cant make the repeats shorter or longer and you cant adjust the timing of the repeats Keep in mind that this is mostly a practice device for your personal use however and I still enjoy using the delay As for the tone which I mostly discussed as a pro in the paragraph above you should be aware that this is not meant to be a clean signal It is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar but its mostly distortion or bust The durability of all of the amPlugs has also been questioned by some The device is VERY lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion I dont doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily The switches and dials may also fail over time But frankly at 40 or 50 its probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging 100 for it which would lock more people out of the market I would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke Finally there as an audible hiss noise through your headphones anytime the device is on Slightly annoying when youre not playing but I dont notice it at all once I start playing notesTHE VERDICTOne other dirty little secret to point out about these things in addition to the Aux jack which allows you to plug in an MP3 player and jam along it is possible to use a 18 to 14 adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp PA or anything with speakers You might be surprised how good it soundsAs an afternote I wrote most of this review playing on my Jackson DR6 which has two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers and it sounded great I later tried it on a Gibson Les Paul which is usually my primary guitar and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers it did not sound as good The distortion was much more fizzy Havent tried it with single coil pickups but I think that it would likely work well with a Strattype guitar due to the overall roundness of the toneThe amPlug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing irrespective of their budget or living situation The Satriani model brings its own special character to the series and if you like the tone as much as I do might become an instant favorite Thick Satriani Lead Tones OntheGo,positive
Strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job The price was right May buy another for a spare nice,positive
Nice quality plug I used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals Works great and no noise The shielding on these Planet Waves cables are great Great quality,positive
I like this mic very much It sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made I do not use it in a professional capacity though but it certainly seems well enough made to stand up to plenty of use Nice sound and well made,positive
Ive used DAddario strings for years and they never fail me These extra light are great for playing lead as theyre easy to bend and feel great on your fingers As they are extra light strings they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear For a brand as a whole id recommend DAddario strings to any guitarist and for gauge its really dependent on playstyle and role if you are in a group Great company always great strings,positive
This was another filler item for a much larger order I am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track Simple idea but a good one Thanks Customer comments,positive
Got them in 3 days and love them So much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing Love them I bought 4,positive
I just got my Snark tuner and Im very impressed with it It attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar The digital readout is easy to see and it gets me in perfect tune quickly It is far superior to previous tuners Ive used Awesome Tuner,positive
I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks really wanted heavy picks the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy has the fender logo on it but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick sweep pick tremelo pick tap with the pick better Also my pitch harmonics better known as squealies come out clearer to me Overall the product is not an disappointment im only using these pick just in different colors from now on Great Picks Better shipping,positive
I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events For the price point I was worried about buying cheap cables This are a great value for your buck The only thing I didnt like about these the cable ties suck haha If you need some quality cheap cable these are for you for Live Sound,positive
I purchased this instrument brand new on an impulse whim due to a managerschoice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore It was brand new unopened in box They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase In that environment I thought it a nice instrumentHowever it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store and that store was VERY busy and noisy Its when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand outThis is indeed a 6string ukulele It measures a bit over 28 top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range The advantage to this of course is its 6 string so if youre a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering that is of course until you realize that while it has 6 strings it is not tuned like a guitar Its tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned Being a total newbie to ukes this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions So my primary purpose in purchasing this to have a small portable guitar hit a snagNow thats not totally the end of the thing because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesnt mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup So all is not lost there It was just an unexpected surprise mainly because I didnt research the instrument prior to purchase its rare that I impulse buySo tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument Thats where the Yamaha really falls short This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box That this was a rush job out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obviousThere are no strap pegs those will require being added by hand not difficult but extra expense and timeThe action is of course too high Thats not unusual in truth its quite common in offtheshelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out hereHowever the thing that bothers me the most if I wasnt aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele Id think its was a cheap knockoff childs guitar Theres not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing This instrument sells for about 100 That low cost is obvious This is a cheap guitar in every way I cant honestly say its a toy but it reeks beginner instrument The tuners are as cheap as they come the finish is cheap there is no decoration no protective edging The finish is unfinishedI bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon and I respect those reviews People have different tastes and for some folks this has a home made feel that they will love However Ive been playing guitar for mumblety mumble decauh years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap I own two Ovation guitars a Peavey electric bass a handmade violin and an Epiphone electric uke which is of such higher quality its not even a contest And no Im not hawking Epiphone Facts is facts thats all You can read my verypositive review on the Epiphone on AmazonWhen I got this home and took a good look at it I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship nothing that said anything more than this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent qualityOther than those two factors one can find 4050 fullsize guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke Other than its portability I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price consider it overpriced or rather undermadeOne must grant its largely a matter of personal taste and expectation But low quality is low qualityEdit two weeks later I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store a direct competition to this instrument The Cordoba is MUCH nicer Its built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely Sorry Yamaha but facts is facts Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side Id have bought and kept the CordobaThats my honest review I know some will disagree But others know exactly what I mean This isnt an expensive instrument so one really cant expect superfine quality at this price However I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom As mentioned the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the sameFortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options and frankly there are Considerable disappointment,negative
Constructed well works perfectly rolls up nicely with no kinks The 20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by GLS Audio Great Cable,positive
Good quality and doesnt cost very much The price is great too Glad I bought it Folds up well Has a black finish on it Good price and quality,positive
I always find it interesting the different opinions about products Some dont like the sound others say these wear out in a day really do you play for 24 hours Some say that the grip is good Heres my take for what its worth Ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars Round and flat wound strings My general take is that these picks give a better fuller rounder bigger tone overall Compared to the tortex style pick material 1 mm for the tortex Its a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material thickness or a combination of both Also note I play with the rounded edge not the tip So the grip in the center of these doesnt quite fit my grip style but its still ok I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all Ive been subjective in my comparisons but this is what Ive found so far I find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars Im currently playing The process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time Give these a try and let me know what you think Very good sound with these picks worth a try,positive
I used this one time so far wmy fishman stick and it served the purpose just fine am looking forward to using it in the future works great simple to use,positive
It is good only thing I did not get was that it has the wire attaching it to the cardboard going through the feedback buster thing so there are two minuscule holes on there not enough you can see but still bother me a little Gets the job done Good,positive
Ive used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price And if youve got a variety of acoustics and dont want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if youre not carefulRemember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something most likely a tuner with stomp onoff bypass so that you can turn it off more easily Works well very convenient,positive
Earnie Balls guitar strap locks are great in my opinion the best there way over other brands like Dunlop Schaller and many others I have them installed on my Les Paul Axcess and my Jackson Dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging You can definetely trust them to do their job They also look great Highly recommended Best strap locks made,positive
The shell and the lining of the case are perfect hard on the outside and soft on the insideI opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right inThe only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap and the lock cold be beat with a bic penIm not traveling around with my guitar too much so thats not a problem for me but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airlineOtherwise it works perfectly for what I bought it for protecting it in my mancave basement from dings and scratches Fits like a glove,positive
I wanted to use this thing for a while before I reviewed it I now own five of them When I compare it head to head so to speak with other tuners even the ones built into my Ovation guitars I find that this one has a little higher resolution That is when the others say Im good this one says no you need to go one tick more Thats not saying that its inaccurate its saying that this one seems to dial you in just a little bit tighter than the others but it still does it very quickly Since I never take it off of the guitar I went ahead and trimmed off the little tabs on the front of the clamping mechanism making it even more unobtrusive You can barely tell its there from the front Quick acurate high resolution and out of the way,positive
This pedal works well in my rig I have two Boss EQ20s advanced EQs and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have this little toy does the trick and does it very well I think that people who writes negative reviews dont know how to use it it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable highly recommended or you can go for the overpriced 100 Boss original unit at the end is the same maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing EQ700,positive
i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy a must for guitarists super tuner,positive
my favorite picks Cant go wrong with tortex the only habit I have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so I have to buy like a ton of them awesome,positive
My son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on Christmas morning I am pleased with this product Worth it,positive
Excellent Quality and CraftsmanshipI was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do I figured it would be made out of a cheap feeling metal I was wrong It is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe It is strong to It feels like I could really bang it I wont and it would not breakI use this with an Audio Technica AT2020 which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base The mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still It does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk or whateverthat will still come through It looks cool too and everybody knows that matters I am very pleased with this purchase Fits AT2020 and other Mics,positive
I am a little disappointed I could use a brighter light I forgot how dim LED lights are I am looking to change if I can find something else Not as bright,neutral
The picks are good They are a little flimsey but are ok The best thing about them is the look good picks,positive
Its a strap Its pretty well made It holds your guitar on your body so you can play it It costs 5 or less deliveredwhat more could you ask for in a strap There may be better ones out there but at more and this does the same thing Planet Waves Polypro Guitar strap,positive
What can i say this is a xlr cablei just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cablesThis one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the roadSo buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest Fair Price and Nice Quality,positive
I compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own I prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty Just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it I got 4 replacememts over 3 years Worth the higher price because of the warranty The 100 dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording note this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it works well,positive
I was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this Saturdays St Patricks Day parade I took a chance on this kit even though I have never purchased anything that says Pyle on the label Upon receiving this kit my first surprise was the quality of the case and then upon opening I was surpised to find that these were the EXACT same microphones as the ones I borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings but branded differently He paid about 350400 for his kit still cheap by todays standardsI pulled out 1 overhead condensor and the kickdrum mic and mounted them fired up the PA and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic We could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit or two overheads they pick up everything very clearly I turned up the volume on the kickdrum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly toosmall mic Now I have a wonderful drum mix coming from only 2 microphones and my mixer has more channels free than I would have expected For fun I added one of the tomsnare mics and they sounded equally clearAfter purchasing this I can tell you that there is absolutely NO way I would purchase one of the highend drummic kits If you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound this is it I promise you will LOVE the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound VERY Pleasant Surprise,positive
This is a great Capo Clamps well and quickly the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break aluminum not plastic I like it and it was well under the price of others Nice Capo,positive
I bought mine used three years ago and it works great It works for a Metallica Pantera type sound You can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq adjusted Great for metal and rock guitar,positive
How much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand First it a great price about the same as a Big Mac LOL Second it fits great does exactly what its supposed to do Third now that I use a pick holder I wonder why I never did so beforeI do have a tendency to break drop or even wearout picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency I have some solid heavier weighted stands that standup to a quick grab of a pick from this holder But when using one of my cheaper lighter tripodstyle stands I make sure Im careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so I dont pull the whole stand down when extracting a pickGreat product couldnt live without it LOL and its NOT the manufacturers fault I have some cheap lightweight stands If youre looking for a pick holder I cant think of any reason not to try this one Great Product,positive
These patch cords work like a champ I use them with my pedal board and havent any issues with signal quality They give some versatility in their length I can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much The colorswellok theyre a little odd but for the price I dealt with it The patch works great,positive
I use to mount a portable digital recorder onto the side of a mic stand Very stable clamp mechanism works very well Price is good Nice to have in your gadget bag Another great On Stage utility,positive
The Danelectro FAB series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget The D5 Chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit This series of pedals FAB have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well Danelectro offers more expensive units but I dont think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view You cant go wrong with this product Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great productI have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great This is a great inexpensive effects pedal from Danelectro,positive
This little stand serves so many purposes for meAt home it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when I want to test out different pedal configurationsAt my gig It holds my presonus mixer A laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers It is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide AND Short or TallAs well I have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it I plan on using this one day to hold my Ableton Live machine as well as a small 2 octave keyboard and I will use the mic boom arm at that point Even as a keyboard stand I like it because I can put pedals underneath it WIth it fully extended to 34Long34 mode I can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it Of course that is 54 solid inches of stage front though Which is indeed a lot for the small places I fit into with my duo Multipurpose,positive
If your a Beatle fan or just someone who collects picks This is the perfect item for you Great graphics Im a guitar pick collector And this is by far the best that i have So if you dont have this Beatle set go and get it a must for all beatle fans,positive
Love this capo on my electric guitar I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily Tried other more expensive capos but this one is the Winner Planet Waves Capo,positive
I honestly dont know alot about guitar picks but they seem to get the job done no problems here I have been using the same one since I got them and have not broke it yet lol Great picks,positive
I purchased these as well as the Jim Dunlop 7000 locks I recommend the 7000 model They both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way but these are just to big and clumsy The 7000 model does the same and doesnt take as much space You will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttonspegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units This is true for either one of the models I have a regular nylon 234 Levy strap and these two models 7000 and 7007SI work well but I prefer the smaller rounder model 7000 too big for me,negative
This is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isnt it try something else I find This best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended LPB1,positive
There is a problem with the design When you move the head the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head just break off The tuner itself is great but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes Broke,negative
Simply a nice assortment of picks to try Worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make Nice variety,positive
I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because its inexpensive yet lightweight flexible and of more than acceptable quality The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness which feels nice at first and feels more studio but when youre actually using the cable it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things For instance Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they areFor just a few bucks more I prefer Pro Co Excellines since they have metal ends and their lifetime warranty is simpler just call Sweetwater which feels nicer to me but I like these just fine Awesome Inexpensive Cable,positive
These are the only picks I use Theyre Fender thins and the quality is one thing that Fender has kept consistent They arrived on time and I will order them again Great picks,positive
I read the reviews of the few similar options I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean Not much of that complaint here But this definitely has that problemMy guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes So this cant go in several outoftheway places I had hoped would work Also I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2guitar rack However the angle makes that very awkwardI hope to modify it to work but Im not super hopeful at this point Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it Dang Not what I Hoped For,neutral
I am impressed at the thought that was put into the design of this product I bought one for my daughter and one for me great deal for a great product Perfect Product,positive
This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and its simpler less expensive and takes up less space The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust I wouldnt try to use it if I were a singing drummer but for a guitarist its great Good idea simple solution,positive
I really did not expect much from this rag I just wanted a good quality lintfree scratchfree cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use I was totally surprised that it actually works this good Removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner This will probably help protect your finish over the long run tooYou may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag This thing rocks It picks up every smudge smear print and leaves nothing behind Its an amazing little cleaning tool and I WILL replace it ifwhen it ever wears out If you are like me and you want your instruments to look clean grungefree onstage you should check out this little wonder You can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want Doesnt get any easier Great productA note about the mixed reviews I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page It really isnt fair to the actual good product to have its rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD microfiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint it makes me sad I have had both of the other items and this microfiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2 This item has sewnseamed edges that will not fray It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind No scratches no lint no hint it was ever there My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth and I use the thing almost every dayI got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it I told him I would just get another Then I came here and couldnt remember which version I bought and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item leaves behind lint What the crap are they talking aboutturns out they are talking about a completely different item I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Microfiber then I placed an order for 2 more 1 for me 1 to give away againPutting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page literally and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones you know what version to buy and which to avoidAnyway End rant This Is Awesome MicroFiber NOT the treated or untreated,positive
Its perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use We use these at my church and they get moved around a little bit but not much For the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fineOf stands in this price range this is at the top of what Ive experiencedIts easily adjustable the screws stay tight once adjustments are made its light but not so light that it tips or blows over the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobblingSeriously for those who dont need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around this is the one to go withIf you need a stand to handle doing live gigs andor going on tour shipping around in airplanes or vans etc you will need to go up a notch or two in quality and sadly price For the price its five stars but compared to others this is a three star stand,neutral
Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life I can assure you that whereas theyre not life or death they do make a significant improvement on the listening process especially in your project studio No theyre not going to make your music sound any better but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down eversoslightly Lastly although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads I cant help but to think that if my monitors were any larger I would need a second pair especially if they were positioned horizontally All and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference An Absolute Necessity For Your Monitors,positive
Very nice polish I have thirteen guitars and I would like to keep them all looking as great as they were new Gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop Use it on everything Make it Shine like the Sun,positive

After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp for the price about 1617 I had to try itWhen I plugged my acoustic into this I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate First lets not expect 500 double 1634 sound from a portable 9v amp Once that reality is recognized its realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and priceI would note that the sound you get out of this amp as with any amp will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup youre feeding from I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different One had very rich tone another sounded 34tinny34 another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup So it wont sound the same on every guitarThat said if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good this amp is simply awesome Ive had it only one day so I havent put it through the test of time but firstimpressions are that I will buy more of these in the future I need more than one portable ampMy sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box and she was impressed as well Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp And I have to say the aqua color is major retro Gotta luv itIve been looking for 34the34 portable amp for some time This is the best Ive found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance I dont know as Id pay the 4050 for this guitar shops often ask but the Amazon price is perfect One last thing Danelectro branded 9v battery included same color as the amp Priceless Awesome little amp,positive
might be my abusive bends though Ill try a ticker gauge next timeOther than that great strings Nice sound but the little E breaks easily when bending but,positive

When I purchased this pedal from a local music store I wasnt even looking for a double pedal set but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my Tama Stagestar kit During my quest for a pedal that had the feel I wanted I sat behind a Pacific drum kit that had these pedals At first I ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hihat I liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when I decided to see what it was like playing double Wow it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilitiesThis pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried There is a slight lag on the left pedal which is normal for any double pedal configuration but youll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedalBefore I purchased this particular model I tried out Tamas Iron Cobra Pearls Powershifter and a Gilbralter Avenger I did not like the stiffness of the Iron Cobra but did like the Pearl and Gibraltar pedals It finally came down to either this or the Gibralter which was slightly smoother but significantly more expensive I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedalIf you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look More importantly try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price features and quality It has to feel right In addition you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hihat which means that you will need to compensate For that I recommend the Gibraltar hihat drop clutch ASIN B0002F73YY which will allow you to engage and disengage your hihat with ease I have my hihats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position but stepping on the hihat pedal using the clutch puts it in full play position Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal Competes with many highend pedals,positive
Ive long been partial to DAddario stringsI dont have a guitar without them These phosphor bronze models have found a home on my Epiphone flattop As the package says theyre warm and brightleaning just a little toward the brassy side They project without sounding harsh or tinny Playing feel is fairly smooth for roundwound strings and they last for ages This is a good intermediate gauge light enough for lead work but substantial enough to provide good backingGuitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string My loyalty is certainly not shaken For any guitarist on another string whose loyalty might be wavering these will reward an audition Nice crisp strings,positive
Simple enough right Works as advertised A great simple idea that Im glad someone put into production For my taste the loop is too long where it wraps around at the headstocknut area so I just tied it up snug I had been using the Martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto a plastic button and this is far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off of the button on the Martin holder However folks with brand new shiny expensive guitars might want to take note while the nylon lace that wraps around is nice and strong it is fairly rough and abrasive and my experience is that it will very definitely wear at the finish of your git in that area Wont rub the finish off or anything to that degree but if youre freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection on your guitar which I am NOT you will definitely notice the finish rubbed and dulled and even chipped a bit there at points of contact I can think of a million simple solutions to that but thats another story Overall great little item Works well a couple caveats,positive
The goodInexpensiveContains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etcworks with 38 or 58Has a carrying caseThe kick mic has a good low frequency responseThe badHas locking clasps with included keys that are too big for the key holesDoes not contain any of the cabling and you will easily spend as much on that as you did on the microphonesNo instructions on how to use the mounts or little things like you can use plyers to remove the 38 adapters from the mountsKick mic needs a mic stand one is not providedThe uglyThe two condenser microphones are incredibly sensitive but at the cost of an incredibly high noise floor There is a ton of hiss at any level setting and it will make your recording sound like a 14 casette tape unless you EQ out all of the highs on the condensers to kill the hissssss Not bad for the price but not good either,positive
Lets get a few things straight from the start I love effects pedals I love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal and have owned a few and Ill also play the massproduced BOSS and Ibanez stuff And if you put foreignnoname brand in front of me but the pedal is made well and sounds GOOD Ill play that too All you need to know is that this pedal is wellconstructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollarsJoyo is a Chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor a heavyduty metal box with an MXRlike button switcher and then clonesmimicscopies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from 100 to 250 And theyve figured out how to ship them to the US and sell them for 40 to 60 each Ive recently discovered these pedals and if moneypedalboard space were no issue theres probably 8 to 12 of them Id like to ownThe star of the Joyo lineup however is arguably the JF02 Ultimate Drive This pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an American company bought them in bulk repainted them and tried to sell them for almost 200 The fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the qualityThe pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the Fulltone OCD Overdrive a boutique pedal that came out several years ago and usually sells from around 150 I own that pedal and Ive done a side by side comparison on my pedal board And while tone is EXTREMELY subjective Im not sure that I wouldnt go with the Joyo Ultimate Drive in a blind test While the 3knob LoHi switch are clearly inspired by the Fulltone OCD the pedals actually sound quite different With the exact same settings the Fulltone will actually sound much brighter Thats really saying something because the Fulltone is known as having a very wellrounded tone with a defined base Well the Ultimate Drive offers even more bass and mids yet the Tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom endIts actually extremely versatile Im not sure that it would do lowgain crunch sounds very well but if thats what you want consider the Joyo Vintage Overdrive the Joyo Crunch Distortion or a Tubescreamer Right now I have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great overdriven Marshall tone The Fulltone the Ultimate Drive and the Marshall GV2 Guvnor While they are all great pedals the Joyo really hits the sweet spot on my Vox Combo amp using a Gibson Les PaulAs for soloinglead play Im noticing all types of pick attackharmonic response with the Joyo that I dont get with other stompboxes It really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel If you point all the knobs at 12 o clock some people may think it is muddy but that Tone knob really does change the character quite a bit Sorry for the long rant but I want people to know that just because you cant afford 150 on a single pedal doesnt mean you cant enjoy a great overdrive stomp box Check the JF02 out it just might be your gateway drug to other Joyo pedals Cant rave enough about this 40 diamond in the rough,positive
great case for my Epiphone Sheraton II If you own a dot sheraton or a 335 you should buy this case It comes with a key so you can lock it Love it,positive
it doesnt completely mute my violin but i suppose nothing really can it does take the loud peircing noise out though works okay,positive
Im a heavier fellow 511 220 and some of the harder benches Ive tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions This one on the other hand is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support It folds up easily and looks to be very well made 5 stars no complaints and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options A very comfortable bench at a great price,positive
I bought these because I am constantly loosing screws when I change pickguards or do new buildsThese are exactly what the doctor ordered Original equipment so theyre the right screws A must have for every guitarist no matter what brand you own as they work on everythingThese are well made and dont strip when screwing in for the first time If its a new project always drill pilot holes anyway I am so glad I bought these one by one they are being usedalmost time to order another setI store them in a little sandwich bag 5 stars fantastic,positive

I am not an avid player but it fits good and for the price you can not beat it I thought it would not be as good but wow my surprise to it and the fit I have a 44 Violin I think handed down from my ggggrandfather the violin is so old can hardly tell what kind it is someone once told me it was one of those stratovariouses tempted to throw it out a couple of times but it is sentimental since it came from and handed down through the family should just pitch the thing but now I do have a nice shoulder comforter Will definitely keep the shoulder thing even if I do pitch the violin for a nice shiney new one Nice on the shoulder makes my old violin look descent,positive
These types of pedals are toys They are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with By all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing If not i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay or distortion A Toy,negative
Nice cymbal better price Im no Metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag Worth the Money,positive

I expected this to be a good mic but its amazing how much different the quality is over your standard desk mic The sounds are very clear and crisp,positive
I bought 5 of these for live recording of my band They adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding I recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage Features Stable base good extension easy hand grip to lockunlock for adjusting For me it was a good perchase Short and sweet,positive
This was the first time Ive ever used a string winder and cutter It make the process of replacing the strings so much faster The tool works great and is sturdy If you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand Guaranteed Great Tool,positive
I like this capo because you can adjust the pressure but Ive had it pop of easily twice already Have others I trust more OK,neutral
easy to install holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat and keeps it off of the floor away from the animals when I have it out of the case great find well worth the purchase price holds the guitar great,positive
WOW something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit Something to Scream about,positive
I can only repeat what everyone else has already said this Kyser capo is designed and built very well Its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier but this is still pretty stylish And the price makes it a real bargain And all together now,positive
This is not top of the line but for the price is a good deal I dont think it lastforever but it works great for my Peavey Patriot Guitar I would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar Good for the price,positive

I purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present So far so good You cant beat the price Thanks Very cool looking guitar picks,positive
So far so good with this pedal Nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activatedI mainly play relatively clean through a tube amp and use this pedal to simply cut through on the leadsI dont use this pedal for searing leads or ultra dirty sounds just a little dirt and two levels of itIt makes a good single channel amp act like a three channel amp and so far it is working greatMain amps 1960 Bassman 2012 Fender Hot Rod Deluxe 1957 Fender Bandmaster these amps sound great with this pedal I dont use all three at the same time but one of these amps is with me when I play outThis pedal is very versatile and there are lots of good sounds in there so you will probably find something you like in there but I dont think it will metal very well by itself but it would kick the front end of a good tube amp into another level of distortion pretty good09272013Still lovin this pedal You gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it upThis pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds and is very versatileI would purchase another if I needed itWorth every penny New pedal SWEET,positive
My first guitar ever I am happy with it I read great reviews here and the price seemed good It is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned And the top part isnt pink like the pic also as others have mentioned It still looks pretty I did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones to minimize finger pain I ordered daddario EJ153D phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings extra light in a package of three sets And I like those strings better The color is nicer though the originals werent rusty they looked new others have said their strings were rusty but mine werent but most importantly its easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter thinner stringsI might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part I am a female and its already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a mans especially bar chords but for now this is fineI also ordered dava 6024 grip tip guitar picks they are nice And I got a kyser 6string capo in gold and that works well And I got a planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system addon for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck The strap I got was a Levys with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable And I got a planet waves pro winder string windercutter which came in handy for restringing And I bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which I havent tried yet And I keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg4 guitar stand And I got a string cleaner by fenderSo I write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar Ill be using mine to sing with so thats why I needed a capo cause many songs I sing need a capo I use a lot of youtube tutorials to learn how to play and also find tabschords on ultimateguitar website I can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband a music recording program that comes on mac computers and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful I am very satisfied with my purchase It came in a big rectangular box and inside that box was another one that looked like a coffin Haha it made me laugh And inside that was my lovely new guitar I am brand new to guitar playing and am happy with this purchase,positive

I have been using these strings for 7 years At first I used the Elixir Polywebs but those things broke all the time I switched to these and havent broke a string since If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string but these match well with my 414ce Taylor Because of the price I dont use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic for that I suggest Earthwoods I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat very pleased there as well The only Strings My Taylor will ever see,positive
This thing sounds amazing except for one small problem At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother Im not talking about extreme settings just gain and 34character34 thats what Tech 21calls it forgot what Joyo calls it at 3 oclock It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tonebetter than any pedal that I have owned and thats probably 2030 distortionoverdrive pedals If only it didnt hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal it is worth considering The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal which costs 189 I dont know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not Review of Joyo British Sound Pedal,positive
As an Old School Guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous With a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual Boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at definitely too large for our practice studio and a bit too heavy to lug aroundI researched every multieffect unit on the market today decided the ME70 was the best way to go for me mainly for the Manual settings When I received the unit it came out of the box ready to go other than installing batteries and worked exactly like I had my rig shrunk down into a rugged small packageCOSM With the amp simulation PreAmp portion I dont need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knobEffects Boss is THE BOSS of effect pedals in my opinion this unit combines everything I need then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking I do not venture into the units ability to remember settings because every venue I gig at has different acoustics constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones I want to hear You Can Rely On BOSS,positive
It is exactly what you need in a capo You can cover all six strings move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held downAll in all a great capo that is well made and will last foreverKyser is an awesome small Christian company and I really like their products and supporting them with my purchases Great,positive
Well heres what i have to say this strap is much shorter than im used to but seeing how I bought this for an off guitar thats ok They really should put the length in the description the length is 53 max where I like my straps to be 64 maxIt is a hard strap to get on the guitar I do not suggest getting this strap withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System Nickel these are great locks BUT almost impossible to install on this strapOverall great buy for a cheap little money saver Not a bad strap,neutral

As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal I completely agree with that And it will sustain your notes It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate I use the NS2 when I use my chain of pedals That said this pedals has some wonderful uses Every note will have the same volume You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume You can set it to sustain for days Again you will need a noise gate There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as ACTIVE as this one Perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do I recommend messing with it quite a while You can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it Great Pedal but YOU WILL need a noise gate,positive
Great strings with a good feel to them They are size 1046 which is just right for my electric guitars I wont know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time I dont think of these as extra lights 0942 they are more of a light to me Great,positive
Make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing Most of them are plasticI bought the ebony with pearly inlay They look great it is indeed real ebony with a pearl inlayThe pins are sort of an odd size not sure if there is a generic pin size so they might work and they might not They fit one of mine perfectly and another not very well I would assume they fit all Martin guitars well because my experience with Martin is that their instruments are pretty similarly made in way of parts and qualityOverall great bridge pins for the price and they sounds much better than plastic ones Look great but dont fit all guitars,positive
Works as advertised Great at eliminating feedback in a live setting Also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly works,positive
The instructions could be written much better but I really like having one of these in fact Ill probably get a second one to tie to the first one so I can include more instrumentsI guarantee if you get one of these youll have a hard time leaving it alone You can even work it into your live performances Boss RC3 Looper,positive
is all I can say I got the unit opened up the softcase and pulled out the nice black powder coated aluminum pedal board andWOW there is a lot of space on this thing Do I think the price is fair for a piece of welded aluminum and what is basically a rebranded Gator nylon bag No Its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro However when I factor in the laziness of not wanting to build my own board suddenly one hundred fifty bucks seems like a decent trade I was a littel disappointed to see the cheapo rubber feet my guess is they will be missing in about 6 months but I have learned to fix those Specifically the product is solid as welded aluminum should be and the soft case feels ruggedwell see Again my only gripe is with the price considering there is no other mounting system other than velcro at least that comes with it and no intergrated power supply However if you need a lot of pedal space read the dimensions and the heft of welded aluminum this may be the last pedal board you buy Did I mention this thing is freggin huge Minus one star for a little price gouging Wow,positive
Good medium picks decent feel and sound Would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling Girlfriend likes the colors hahaha Good Picks,positive
These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut I have several other good cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know its worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables Yes you can get many cables way cheaper and Im all for getting things at a good price publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet but this is a case of you get what you pay for These Cables Are Great,positive
Aquila strings will never let you down Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players Italian made need I say more Aquila rocks,positive
I bought this case for my Rogue Astyle electric mandolinThe inside is nicely lined the hardware is solidIt came at a great low price but it does not feel cheapI recommend this to anyone with an Astyle mandolinjafmusicmix Solid feel nice fit,positive
But the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio Theres a slight hiss too But I enjoyed listening to it while playing And when you attach the headphones it works great Amazine that it works off a 9v battery Yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect I went all out and got a Roland Cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects But that costs 2x or more as much I am in the process of returning it Look at the picture of it next to a Coke can Thats what it looks like Some people complained that the handle doesnt work Who cares The tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too But thats sort of what youre getting This actually works,positive
This is just like any other microphone stand It works the same and is pretty durable The weight at the bottom will definitely stop it from falling if someone were to acciddently bump into itwhich is great but could also be bad if you want to carry the stand around a bit In order to do that you must either support the weight which can be a pain or unscrew it from the base Other than that its great Good stand,positive
Not too light and bendy not too heavy and stiff these picks are just right Dunlop also makes quality picks and I have yet to break one of these They last a long time I am a guy so at first I wished they werent purple but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I dont really care what color they are anymore I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these Now This is Goldilockss pick,positive
This is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos and you get free shippingYeah its not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones but still not bad better than an elastic strap typeIt is also great for creating your own short cut and drop D capos With a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuffDo not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin You can add a pad of some sort or just take care to not to overtighten itIm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through So far it doesnt look like it will though great deal,positive
I bought these hoping they would allow me to learn to bend guitar strings blues style They turned out to be just right I dont play that often but they have lasted for a lot longer than expected very pleased with the product and price right tension for me,positive
This pedal is amazing It has so many functions Unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic I love this pedal and I would completely recommend it Great echoe delay,positive
Solid reliable and rocksWorks as expected and should last a really really long time Glad I bought it Nothing else to say Thanks Great cord,positive
This is my 6th Joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint I think these and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days Like many have mentioned this pedal is like a TS but without the midhump This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture When you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it it breaks up When you play lightly it gets cleaner which is why it is so similar to the 200 Sweet Honey pedal the controls are also identical but I havent compared the internals That touch sensitivity is lost IMHO if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain When you do that it acts more like a traditional OD would which is totally cool but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart If I could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more midgain like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or the Dano Transparent OD but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and dont have that kind of bankroll you should definately check this outEdit Having owned this pedal for a while I realize I was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox This pedal actually plays well with midgain types of overdrives like the Joyo Ultimate Drive the OCD or the Dano Drive When you dig in you CAN get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isnt dimed This pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me Five stars for doing what it does at this price point,positive
This amp is a quality item for the dollar range I paid 4999 There is some question about sound quality and variation in quality We purchased two of these and one arrived with some minor issues constant humming regardless of volume or EQ settings Amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problemThis is not a 6000W stage amp nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighborsit has a full punch output at full gainvolume and can easily light up a back yardSpecsInput 14 Mono not a tip and ring jackControls VolumeGain and selectable Volume 3EQ range knobs There are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selectorOutputs 14 Mono for monitor or mixer 14 Dual Mono Headphone jack tip and ring supplied from the same mono channelPower Lighted front panel rocker switchThe box is very slim and small about a foot by a foot and 8 deep the rear is partially open speaker exposed and allows for cord storageProsPortability easy of use and set upQuality finish leatherette with steel corners and good construction 6 heavy duty lead guitar speakerExcellent sound and electronics for ANY amp under 100 There are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are 3050 more Go with this oneConsUnits run hot and cold as to quality but if it works out of the box its good if not youll know it as soon as you power it up Buy with confidence at Amazon from Amazon and you shouldnt have any worriesThese amps power two Squiertm by Fender electric guitarsSquier by Fender Bullet Strat with Tremolo Bundle with Strings Pick Card and Polishing Cloth Black Rosewood Fretboardand do a great jobOther accessories for the beginner electric to considerCords Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 FtPlanet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable 10 feetStrap Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap BlackStraplocks Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System NickelHanger String Swing Hardwood Home Studio Guitar Hanger Shades May Vary A Great Little Amp for the money,positive
This is my 3rd set of cables I ordered from Amazon I needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one The finish is not bad on the outer PVC layer and coated zinc alloy body Works fine with my mixer My previous set of cables totally 4 cables each one of them develop some kind of problem after few months exactly on the same spot I guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working I would see how this goes and update the review If this one also would result in same condition I would look for something better The only reason I ordered the same ones again and again was because of the pricing They are not expensive to replace Lengthy cable,positive
A little nicer than I thought it would be As far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it I like the pick pocket too But dont let the pocket be the selling point Its not that cool Really Nice,positive
I use the 21 cable Great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great I like the smooth fabric sleeve it doesnt stick to things like a plasticrubber cable can Excellent cable,positive
Unbelievable clear sounding on a Mandolin Cant yet get the sound out of a violin that I want with it but still experimenting Will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while its connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noiseAll in all 7 very well spent Thank goodness pickup prices are coming down Only a few years ago you could not find a pickupmic even this good for 60100 Now if only the price of pickupchics would come down Unbelievably good for 7,positive
this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there I have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together Definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised Lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedalLike many other reviewers my gripe with the new pedals is the switch may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation nice over drive,positive
Bought bass case for stratwanted extra spaceas the lining is q memory foam and holds the instrument gently in place it also acts as the lid for the open spaceI keep several musicnote Books under the head stockother reveiwer complained of the excess space but thats what I wanted It did have chemical smell but as I open items in garagenear trash can for the packagingit aired in a few minutes Totally happy with service and product perfect for what i wanted,positive
Currently my favorite pick its thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle Id recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like My favorite,positive
Ive got three of these simply because they work and theyre easy to carry from place to placeand I insist on a stand for my guitar none of this 34leaning stuff This makes three,positive
Oh quick note this capo is meant for instruments with radiused NOT flat necks That said it works fine on a nonradiused ukuleleIve been using only Kyser capos for many years now They dont fall off they dont usually pull strings sharp but they do grip TIGHT and can damage some finishesThis capo is easy on easy off with the pistol grip has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it wont damage finishes and has adjustable tension I backed off the tension as much as possible set it on the neck made one adjustment and it was perfect Since I can adjust the tension I have no worries about it pulling strings sharpI only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths Works like a champ even on Ukuleles,positive
I accidently ordered two of these which proved fortunate because one did not have a battery when it arrived at my APO in Afganistan where watch batteries are hard to come by That being said This is the most user friendly little tuner I have ever owned I dont have a particularly good ear but I can tell when I am out of tune and I have struggled with other tuners in the past trying to get just the right tune I bought this for a brand new backpack guitar and I had the guitar tuned up in less than 5 minutes after I clamped this tuner on the neck These are cheap enough to buy one for every guitar and keep it in the case Awesome little tuner at crazy low price,positive
I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldnt be happier This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels it is really lightweight a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried this makes it VERY easy to play it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovelyI like it so much that I decided to add a pair of Slashs Alnico IIs on it that cost more than the guitar itself this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain good ol crunchybluessy rockCall me cheap if you want and I wouldnt care this is one of those items that makes you wonder how come theres others way more overpriced and just dont find a way to justify that a real Gibson Les Paul will sound 800 1000 betterIt wasnt until recently after 3 years I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use that it started fretting and thats why I gave it only 4 stars but what would you expect from a 200 guitar Im sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweettone machine it has always been If youre learning looking for a first electric or just want a practice axe that will not dissapoint you just go ahead and buy it dont give it a 2nd thought and do it First electric guitar,positive
These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 8020 Bronze They are warmer sounding well balanced Cost a lot but well worth it to me Very good sound,positive
For the price this works really well I see no faults It can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now Works,positive
Notice in the name guitar INPUT This is not to be confused with the Amplitube iRig which achieves input and output through the iPadiOS devices headphone jack Headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems They also depend on the built in ADDA converters in the iPadiOS device This Apogee Jam 96k is a professional quality INPUT device that has dedicated AD analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the iPadiOS device for playback On the other hand 34Apogee One34 has both AD and DA convertors for both input and outputAmplitube iRig from IK Multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your iPad The built in hardware in the iPad is something that I love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the 10 inch screen but for audiophile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and AD convertor and that is what this Apogee Jam 96k has Mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your iPad You can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality eg saving as a Wav file This makes the Apogee 96k Jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice priceSo here it the continuum Amplitube iRig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your iPad etc The Apogee Jam 96k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on iPad The Apogee One on the other hand at roughly 3 times the price gives you both ADDA conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus 2 tracks of recording either 1434 instrument andor a balanced external microphone jack It also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing It also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic When you get into the Apogee Duet and Quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of MIDI connectivity Getting in the door with Apogees incredible sound quality at an incredible price,positive
This bag includes several different thicknesses of picks so you can see which fits your playing style best and the varied colors means the more vain of us can color coordinate our pick and instrument Nice selection,positive
This compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians electric guitar rigs Its very basic two controls and one toggle but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal Both my jazz bass and my Precision Bass sound great through this pedal A Standard MustHave,positive
These are solid stands for holding your guitars I use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great They are an excellent valueThe reason they are so important to have is that by having your guitars out and available to play you will get more practice They help me pick up my guitars much more often Instead of dragging out the case and getting a single 20 minute session I might get 4 or 5 10 minute sessions a night more on the weekendsStands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store I highly recommend these for around the house use One of Your Most Important Tools for Learning the Guitar,positive
Once again received a good product for a good price and fast deliveryhave never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon All latch well and look good Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the wayhave five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them All fit and work as expected perfect as always,positive
Standard great quality from Planet WavesDaddario but these certainly can change price very frequently throughout the year I think it almost doubled in price a week after I ordered not sure why Great Product but prices fluctuate,positive
At first I thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous but after actually trying one I love it It has really helped me deliever that Fatal BlowI can honestly say this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out Not to mention that its hard to strum and sounds awfulWhat these picks are good for is leads Rock Metal Shredding and even Country The sound is short with a very high tone pitch Switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull One plus is while recording I do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking shredding as I did with a plastic pickI still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound but love these picks when things heat up Also Id like to add that even though I can play Rock You Like A Hurricane by the Scorpions it never sounds quite right Until Now Using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker soundAlso these picks have a noslip grip With the Fender facing your fingers there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves its very easy to grip and use It feels funny at first but I got use to it really quickI can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience Nice tight sound,positive
This is a quality stand I use it for my Yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great Nothing but praise for this item Good Stand,positive
This thing is a little jewel I have a jazz guitarroacuten ie a modified Mexican Mariachi guitarroacuten that is custom strung down to the third E below middle C which is E1 at 412 Hz This little tuner does the job It works clipped onto the head and on the bridge also but a guitarroacuten bridge is a bit wide for it so clipped directly onto the lower edge of the sound hole ie near the the most treblesounding string There it works perfectly and consistently even on that lowest E and its entirely out of the way since my right hand is coming at the strings from near the bassmost stringBold_strummer mentions that it buzzed on his classical guitar and initially I found the same problem BUT it turned out NOT to be the tuners fault but mine After tuning I had gotten into the habit of turning it face down against the wood of my instrument When I did that it made just enough contact with the surface of my instrument to create a buzz It took me two weeks to figure out what was making the buzz since the noise was coming directly out of the sound hole even though I had the tuner clipped to the head at the time When I realized it was the turner all I had to do was NOT turn it down against the instrument when I wasnt using it Ever since then no buzz Brilliant huh cAnother reviewers idea about getting two of these so as to keep a spare packed in your gig bag is a great one At this price why not This is a great little item Works great on my acoustic bass all the way down to E1 412 Hz,positive
Picks are one of those items in which taste is 98 of what decides if it works for each or not That being said I have to admit that these picks are very high quality The design is really pragmatic and effective I recently was introduced to these by a student of mine and I have to say for the first time in 15 years I changed my picksI used dunlop made with Lexan material and those I found to be perfect until these came along Sometimes change is good We just need to be open to it Just a matter of taste,positive
If you have a ukulele you know or may not know that it needs constant tuning especially with new strings This little gadget does the trick I was pleased to see that it is a no brainer to use and since it clips to the head it is there when you need it between songsYou will not go wrong with this purchase and I am sure you will love it better than trying the 34my dog has fleas34 tuning methodOh yea it does not just limit you to the basic notes for the uke but will tell you sharp and flat notes tooNow put that order in What a bargain,positive
I like the drum machine and the tuner but I dont like the effects I dont have an electric guitar I only have acoustic electric guitars and I thought that maybe I could make it sound like an electric but the sounds are distorted and not very clean it sound muffFor an electric guitar maybe it would work fine but not for an acoustic electric guitar Its OK,neutral
The best tuner for your board in my opinion Great display easy to viewread and a simple click on and off that isnt noisy Since it is true bypass the pedal turns off when it is not engaged which is a great feature since the battery will not drain while not in use even when things are plugged into it Silent onoff and I have two of them Recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig Best tuner for anyones rig,positive
When youre just starting to purchase equipment and are on a budget look into Plant Waves line up of cables and suchThey offer good middle of the road accessories Even high end also Check them out they carry OK equipment These mic cables are working really well for me Highly recommended Planet Waves has some good products,positive
At last I got this mic after doing about a month of homework on which condenser mic to go for If youre debating between the Blue Yeti Snowball Samson C01U and this mic there are plenty of reviews on youtube and google At2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality Finally,positive
Good product But Id expected more robust on your structure But its good product Dont have adhesive to bind on the surface Guitar rest,positive
this is a fun pedal and it really seems to work pretty good as far a getting tube like tones Simple this is fun,positive
It is always a delight nowadays when any electronic device is still functional after such a long time From 2006 when I bought it till 2013 when I write this still going strong very happy with my purchase Alas my experience says newer devices being sold are rarely as good as when they first come out but you never know it may still be as good as ever nowFor what its worth I am a professional musician with perfect pitch Still going strong since 2006,positive

I had the opportunity to try a set of Elixir Nanoweb light gauge 013 053 strings in both Phosphor Bronze and 8020 Bronze Instead of writing a separate review for each I figured I8217d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needsThe Phosphor Bronze strings are mounted on a brand new Guild F47 RC guitar It is a concert sized guitar with a Florentine cutaway The body is Brazilian Rosewood and the top is Adirondack Red Spruce I have always heard that Phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a Rosewood guitar I would agree The tone is nicely balanced 8211 maybe a bit weak in the bass but the strings are new and in a couple days I expect them to sound a bit better The notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange toneThe Nanoweb coating is nice It protects the strings from corrosion finger sweat really can do a job on strings without dulling the sound I think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original Guild strings and it just plays easierThe 8020 strings are mounted on a Gibson Hummingbird 8211 an iconic Mahogany bodySprucetopped Dreadnaught sized guitar Again 8020s are recommended for Mahogany guitars As popular as the Hummingbird is I was never totally pleased with the sound of it It is a great guitar to strum along with while singing but it almost sounded too muddied 8211 not enough articulation between the different strings The Elixir strings really bring out something extra from the Gibson It sounds a LOT better and feels easier to play The strings are easier to play 8211 partially because of the coating 8211 partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity 8211 without going out of tuneThe bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes I am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the Martin SPs that were on it prior to the switchElixirs are not the cheapest strings out there but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings in the end you won8217t spend more money on what I think are far superior strings Great sounding and playing strings,positive
This is another great product by DAddario I have used several tuners like the regular Snark several versions the Snark S1 Mini Clip also known as Son of a Snark the Planet Waves Headstock Tuner the Peterson SC1 Strobo Tuner the Korg HTB1 and the Q7 Chromatic Headstock Tuner This DAddario Micro NS Tuner tops all those with ease It is super easy to use and more precise than all the others compared using several tuning computer softwares and the Korg Pitchblack floor pedal on my tests The rotation feature is great and the visual metronome feature comes very handy like when programming a delay pedal with more precision The clip that holds the tuner to the guitar is very good holds very well to your guitar headstock doesnt matther the brand and with stay snug there without damaging your guitars finish It is very light and you will hardly know its there once playing Highly recommended Cheers DAddario NS Micro ClipOn Excellent headstock tuner,positive
Really a nice upgradeespecially for the price They did stick up higher than the plastic pins but I had read that they would At least I know that they fit snug Really look good Classy Upgrade,positive
Well unless you absolutely botch production its hard to go wrong with some guitar knobs Typical plastic durable and looks good Good product,positive
Make sure you order the right size I dont use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings great sustains,positive
This device sounds okay its usable But you should plan ahead if youre in the USA and want one it ships from mainland China it takes a while to get to the States Works okay,neutral
These strings are performance value and always give me a great sound I have been using Elixirs for 5 years now and they last longer even in this salty air environment by the beach and sound better than anything else I have ever used Again and again,positive
Its a good quality case I wouldnt check it as luggage when flying but its small so bring it as a carryon Itll protect your mando just fine Just in case,positive
Great quality nice interior and fits my Yamaha F335 perfectly Solid and steardy case that will last a very long time Wonderful case,positive
I enjoy using it and its helpful when you wanna use it to hold up your sheet music to a viewable point and your books too I recommend it Good stand,positive
the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic BEst strings,positive
I love being able to adjust the tension Does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp downJust wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar Works great,positive
its simple to operate it does what its made to do it does that very well its bargaintasticIf you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one then I highly recommend this unitIm about to get a second one and put all my distortioncreating devices in the loop other Behringer units Rat Big Muff etc etc The one I already have can stay at the end of my signal chain just before the delays Pretty much a musthave for recording especially during those quiet spots Thanks to this unit I have a very quiet recording setup one cant fault it really,positive
Just to confirm several other reviews these hangers are really nice They add a nice look to your room and they perform a muchneeded function very well As other have said though the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and I DONT recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywallEven my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall so theres no way Id trust any of my proper guitars to these things I bought some heavyduty anchors from the local DIY store you can get them from Amazon tooTOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA Toggle Bolt with Bolts USA Made For 31624 Fastener Size Pack of 10 and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw Much better I have a few of these holding up a Les Paul type a Strat a Godin and a GL tele and theyve been holding up pun intended fine for a few weeks now Drywall mounts are useless hanger itself is GREAT,positive
Works well It can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically I find myself using it a lot Even as I learn the notes on the guitar fretboard If I guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note I also use it to intonate my guitar It has some other advanced features but I havent need them Display is nice and large even though I still need my reading glasses to see the note Works like a charm,positive
If you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed Sounds weak Sounds old Sounds worn Sounds dull I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster I can afford to pay twice as much But I am going to keep using my Dadario Strings from now on I am so disappointed These strings are for the 34campfire guitarist34 not the aggressive picking thrilling tapping pull offs or sweepers If you are a tone fanatic keep looking If your guitar deserves the best do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings Respect your GUITAR I wouldnt be surprised if they are made from China If you love your sound respect your guitar and amp Avoid using DR My guitar needs prozac It has PTSD Thanks to DR strings,negative
I love these little guitar stands They are small enough to go anywhere with you and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around Which is good if you are as clumsy as I amThe last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage I know I know but they really are cool little stands and I just bought another one lol I am a glutton for punishment Cool but usually get squished,positive
So far I am a very satisfied customer with this cable For what is worth while I have used these cables before this is the first one I have ever owned so I am no expert Great cable,positive
This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos Im truly surprised by all the good reviews here Im not sure how its possible Ive already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos I had purchased two which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring Both capos had this very same problemWhen I received these capos I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brandname printed anywhere on the product As a professional musician I need to purchase reputable brandname products because I cant afford to have my gear failing during performances I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand and no measurable reputation When I contacted the seller they were not honest with me These Capos are not made by the Jim Dunlop company,negative
I put this on my mandolin This does not work as well as some others I have tried but the other one I was using broke very easily so I looked for a different more sturdy design This works OK Not the greatest but OK Skinny profile which is nice,neutral

Not only is this a quality guitar stand that is adjustable it is really affordable to and it has a safety strap for the top of the neck of your guitar that will keep ur guitar from falling forward this is a great buy this is a greatgood quality guitar stand for a greatprice,positive
Had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong Just a simple well made product that does the job Perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest Looks classic too Simple and to the point,positive
I love these picks Medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people This is a great looking pic and you get 12 of them at such a great price I wouldnt buy anything else Great picksGreat price,positive
I bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they dont disappoint Theyre fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying Just what I wanted,positive
The Squier Bullet that I have is actually the model without the tremolo however everything else is just about the same as the model you see above Its a nice guitar for the money Nice size action and finish Its not a highend guitar so dont expect it to sound like one but for a beginner its pretty sweet I bought a more expensive blues guitar and had planned on trading this one in or selling it however I like it so much that I plan on keeping it as a back up Parts are pretty easy to come by with slight modifications but thats to be expected and fairly cheap too Nice guitar for the price,positive
I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picksThese picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are I play guitar everyday for around 35 hours a day and I have yet to break one of these picks Very nice quality and very cool color to them They are also priced very goodMuch cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar Additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door Three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step Very Nice Picks,positive
I think I have 3 or 4 of these Work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use Highly recommend Get a few just in case but I am still on my first I do switch straps so I guess I have 2 in use makes it very easy to put guitar on andor change out straps Great for Accoustic Guitar,positive
These microphones are great for recording vocals They pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds They do not have any detectable noise or issues Depending on your situation you may need to have a external popfilter or windscreen however these microphones contain an internal windscreen This product ships as expected,positive
I bought two microphones a AKG D5 and SM58 I like AKG D5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the AKGThe SM sounded muted compared to D5 without any sound modification out of box The output is also a little less sensitive than the D5However I like the look of SM58 and it seems to be extremely durable Good,positive
I have found that sometimes these cheapy ones tend to break fairly easily but these ones have lasted me a very long time Hardly any breaks considering I get the thin ones Really good quality,positive
If youre a bass player and use a pick you need one of these If you are a bass player and sometimes use a pick you really need one of these I bought one for every bass and a spareWedgies work better on bass than guitar because the strings are thicker and usually parallel I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the stringsbut the bass ones stay putReally these things are great Indispensible,positive
Just got mine fast shipping from amazon thank you It has a great weight to it very similar to a real piano I was a little lost when i plugged it into my Yamaha S90ES similar to the newer versionYamaha S90XS 88key Balanced Weighted Hammer Action synthI SHOULD OF READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BOX the polarity needed to be changed on the pedal found on the backwoops i was in constant sustain there for a minute scared me that my pedal was brokenanyways it instantly makes my awesome electronic keyboard sound so much like a real deal pricey pianoawesome Great feel Works with the Yamaha S90 ES Sythesizer,positive
Cant say much more than the description Its a cheap box that works Nothing fancy and not for everyone If you just need a box that is cheap this is it Cheap direct box that works,positive
This comes COMPLETE with bridge saddles and full size block and its FENDER I dont think this is a true steel block I believe its Zinc Alloy but thats Fenders fault The company I bought it from Ant Hill Music via Amazon is very honest and likable people I have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for Squiers They made my cv50s sound fuller with greater sustain Im sure Ill buy more in the futureI should add it does not come with a whammy bar but your my old squier whammy bars fit perfectly into it Excellent improvement in sound over the standard Squier block,positive
I recently received my multi plug cable daisy chain for use with my guitar pedals and I am very pleased with one spots product I can tell it is a built to last cable with eight plugs spaced out enough to allow me to put my pedals where I like them It plugged into my Behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely Its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week A real money saver in the long run Buy this cable Very good product,positive
At first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth But these ones really get the guitars shining up really nice They are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good Large cloth and nice for polishing,positive
works ok for the price and features it is fine get the batteries it did not came with any I am using it for a dj karaoke system I do recommend it it is ok,positive
I have a Candy apple red Squier Surf Statocaster Came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd Switch it for this Black one Looks great really classes it up in my opinion I also got black knobs as well fits my axe perfectly Classes up my Squier Surf Stratocaster,positive
What a difference a pop filter makes I use on a condenser mic it lets me get a little more gain input clamps on easy and holds good the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension It has improved the vocal tracks Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio Nady MPF6 Pop Filter,positive
These picks work well and look as pictured The shade of pink is very close to that in the picture I would recommend them Great,positive
This is a really good patch cable Fits into different brand of pedals well and is really flexible with out feeling like its cheap I was able to weave it in and out of the Pedaltrain Pro no problem In fact Ive order 4 more sets of these for the rest of my pedals Highly recommended Great patch cable,positive
Yes I would buy is a great strap nice comfort nice priceFits nice in to my Fender guitar a thumbs up Great looking strap,positive
Great gripLasts a good long whileTerrific trippy pearl tones and azuresMy all time fave Hip hip hooray Great,positive
I have used the Line 6 looper in the past Line 6 JM4 Looper The Line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the SpiderJam amplifier Its a decent looper but its too big and I dont need all the guitar tones backing tracks etc that go with it so I decided to look elsewhereI wanted a looper that I could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality multiple channels etc and this one fit the bill You can adjust the loop volume switch quickly between tracks turn the background percussion down or off etc I purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracksThe only fault that Ive found thus far is that the foot switch cable that DigiTech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a 90 degree This is weird as all pedals on a board need a 90 degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal To solve this I bought a Hosa 90 degree stereo connector it has to be stereo HOSA RT ANGL STER 14 PHONE F STEREO 14 PHONE M Ive added a photo of the JamMan on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thePedaltrain MINI With Soft CasephotosOne other great attribute of this pedal is its built solid and is easy to stomp on you dont have to have perfect aim just good timing There are a few strange nuances though For example you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track This gets the track started before it clears it Not good if you were using it in a performance However there are workarounds like just switching tracks Overall great deal for the price and if you are looking to improve your lead guitarimprov I would certainly recommend a pedal like this one Its earned a place on my pedal board,positive
I ordered these tuners for my Fender Blacktop Stratocaster MIM I just received these tuning machines today the pegs line up so they drop right in Remember the EAD are that tall capstans and the GBE are the shorter capstans it all works out Ive also put 5 springs in the block I like stiff tremelo bridge flush to surface and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional Strat knobs had to get CTS splitshaft 500K pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots The amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar BUT back to the tuners they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning Much easier and faster to change stringsI just ordered another set for my Strat HSS great guitar but could certainly use these tuners Great for Fender Blacktop Stratocaster MIM,positive
I was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar I would have thought pledge would work but after a little reading I found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance After scoping out Amazon I came up with this product and I am happy It makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use It also comes with a nice polishing clothgreat deal for the money Works great and a great price,positive
This is a cheap stand and I was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived The top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made I do not recommend this product Stage Rocker SR Cradle Guitar Standblack,negative
These are fantastic and unique guitar picks I love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well Its always nice to have a conversation item and these little ones age great to show off to your guy friends Love them and theyre good quality picks too so I will use them GREAT picks,positive
I have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers including a few of the Vox Valvetronix series However this is both my first Fender amp as well as my first true 34tube34 amp First some clarification is needed on 34tube34 vs 34modeling34 amp The Fender Super Champ X2 is absolutely a tube amp it has one 12AX7 and two 6V6s and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages However the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone which is what allows it to project different 34voices34 Contrary to what some posters have written Channel 1 does also have some frontend modeling except that the the model is fixed for 34Blackface34 tone and controlled by a separate volume know no gain control Channel 2 offers 16 different 34Voice34 presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage Fender amplifiers including the Tweed Deluxe Bassman Deluxe Princeton and Twin Settings 915 model a variety of other popular amps including the Vox AC30 and MarshallOverall I found the available tones to be excellent Unlike my Valvetronix where I more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times I could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars One thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently you may have to adjust volume gain bass and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp However I found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component Also the X2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or 34hissing34 you hear with digital modeling ampsThe tones that come out of the 1034 speaker of the Super Champ X2 are very rich and touchresponsive as youd expect from a tube amp The amp has TONS of highend sparkle but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume true of many amps The stock speaker which is Fenders own design and has a ceramic magnet I believe is frequently criticized as a weak point However it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps or only intend on playing at bedroom levels youre unlikely to take issue with it The Eminence Ragin Cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end But again the amp is plenty loud and fullsounding for its size Better intended for homestudio use than most gigs but it excels at what it doesThat brings us to the effects section and the Fender FUSE software that works with the amp via USB cable Frankly Im not a fan of most onboard effects with combo amplifiers I prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrivedistortion The good new is that the onboard reverbs which include spring room hall and a few others if you install them from the software are quite good You can also reassign the presets to different effects So if you want a flanger with a reverb you can have a setting for that If you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb you can do that too The Tap Tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects But as I said while they represent a good value for players that dont want to invest in pedals Im more likely to use my Boss DD3 than the onboard delay and so onThe build quality of the Super Champ X2 is largely excellent The grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of Fenders more expensive amps The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top One thing I did note however is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting so I will have to be careful about that Also there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better But overall the amp looks very well constructed I was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic but everything is mapped to vintagelooking knobs and from a few feet back the amp looks just as much at home in the 60s as it does post2000Overall I think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that I hope to enjoy for years to come Im only really scratching the surface of its potential but it makes great Fender tone sound easy The Fender FUSE software could be a little more intuitive to work with and I wish there were a better way to know what each of the Voice and FX settings correspond to without consulting a chart But its a great little amplifier thats all the power youd need for hobbyists and studio recording and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well Affordable vintage tube amp with some modern flexibility,positive
I got a couple of theseonly buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real worldafter only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plugand of course since this cord is moldedsealed up tight it cant be repairedyou could cut off the plug and solder a good 14 inch plug on itbut why botherjust save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cordthis cord is too flimsyits junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housingbut inside its junkthrown away moneybuy a lottery scratch off instead avoid avoid,negative
So good that I bought another one Love the heavy cord and gold connectors Guitar sounds great I just learned last night how to coil them up I guess I should read instructions more carefully But no harm done still works great The Best Cable,positive
This stand is sturdy and my guitars 34seat34 like an anchor I use one for my electric and another for acoustic Will be getting another as soon as I get daughters new guitar I will be buying a third one great stand,positive
This is the best one out there BAR NONE Really this is a keeper Wish it came in different neon colors as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage That would make this one the BEST It really is the best out there,positive
These items though well made and strong are sized rather differently to National picks With the National I need a Large so I ordered Large in this item it is however very tight smaller in fact than a National Medium thumb pickEssentially a waste of money Sizing not as expected,neutral
At first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings but these do work extremely well They seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner postI do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that theyre spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed That does make storing them a little akward but again I think this is the best product out there if you change your own stringsPS If you are using scissors to clip strings ends you are crazy buy these things Excellent high quality,positive
Nice strap Very comfortable Doesnt cut into your body at any point Easy to adjust Worth the price Would definitely buy another Levi Strap,positive
Not knowing much and after using for a couple of months Im pretty happy with guitar for the money I paid for it Fit and finish is quite nice Just needed tuning Great beginner model Feels solid and stays in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions Very decent starter guitar,positive
A nice simple adjustable strap that has well reinforced ends to hold the attachment posts on my guitar without any worries It is a bit slippery so for topheavy guitars like Les Pauls the neck tends to keep slipping down so you have to support it with your fret hand a little I thinking of sewing a silicon mat on the underside so it will stay put on my shoulder At this price it is hard to beat,positive
I was an Ernie Ball guy for a long time But I was getting pissed because the Ernies kept corroding so quickly So I tried these and they seem to hold up better There are coated strings that will last longer but I dont like spending so much on strings And of course they sound excellent too Stock up The Best for cheaper strings,positive
I love this capo Let me tell you about my capo journey where Ive used every brand while searching for this one First I always owned the old Dunlop Toggle Action capo which is just old tech you know where its just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber the kind one used to use before 1980 I had to go back to that when my first Planet Waves black THERMOPLASTIC capo broke Dont buy those if you live in a damp climate like CA Each one I bought broke one broke within a week during the winter rainy days So I loved those capos they were perfect but I was done with the breaking so I figured Id try others instead despite my love for the Planet Waves design I didnt know about the silver aluminum one yet Well I hated each other one I tried Kyser if you have had carpal andor are small handed you know what I mean you dont want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you dont want to play the guitar I really hate the Kysers I know some folks love to squeeze and use them thats fine different strokes right Then I tried the Schub you have to be kidding me OMG that thing is so ridiculous it pops off it wiggles about it is tricky I hate it Now I know many folks are Schub fans who give me a drive by downrate Im not saying it isnt great for those who love it If you love the Schub you love it unconditionally and I respect that all Im saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me There are other models that fail similarly to these 2 they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands like the G7 I did fall in love with it until maybe the 5th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on Awkward and painful Sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby but if you have carpal you know what I mean you want to go easy on the hands and arms and not brutalize them The other thing Ive always hated about the Kysers and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder Thats just dumb Kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or dont mind it or claim it doesnt do that but you know what Im talking about Ok so then because of all the broken Planet Waves thermoplastic capos I turned next to Dunlops turnscrew models I liked them they are very similar to the PW design but the screw location is more awkward to use and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it So I turned back in search for a better Planet Waves model This is it right here The silver one is excellent and its made of aluminum not thermoplastic I bought one and it has lasted me almost 3 years now without a single problem By now in contrast I would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones I want to say that if you are performing in a public venue never use the thermoplastic ones because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room and could easily poke someones eyes out Not kidding dont use those in public situations Back to the excellent aluminum silver PWaves capo I love it because it doesnt break not at all and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc The great features are1 Ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos This capo fits so easily Simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches unlike the other screwtops or all other capos theres no need for any moving around adjusting the guitar falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar sheesh none of that nonsense You put it on and theyve engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on move it from fret to fret put it where you want and screw it in with great ease Wow best ever in this category Ease of use is tops ever2 It will never hurt you it only helps It weighs nothing is easy to carry you can slip it onto the peg area it just is so light I still cant believe how light it feels3 It does what its supposed to that other capos dont do No issues with being in tune just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire no wrestling around like some capos do The screw is in the most easy location and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesnt hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew its a breeze No problems with the size its so small it doesnt get in your way on the fretboard You wont have to do hand yoga in order to play capod songs it is FLAT I know what a concept A capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords not pretzeled twister instead of chords Now I play capod songs all the time because of this capo and it is so much fun musically a whole new magical experience The truth Ive found is that good equipment matters in music making I never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until I got my first Applause guitar with great action I have a Yamaha I love now since the Applause necks break but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment thats easy to use in the case of guitars great action is imperative In the case of capos ease of use and no pain produced is imperative and it opens up the world of capo use the magic of the mathematics of music theoryIf you love the other brands dont diss me I know its perfect for you and Im happy for you that it works perfectly for you because when you have the best one for you you will shine with your music and I will enjoy listening to you play But those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what Im talking about you wont settle for the torture of Kysers and Schubs gotta be kidding me I bought every capo imaginable need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile but ended up that I was using the old toggle type again instead until I found the aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo Planet Waves has made the perfect capo now no more issues just easy fun playing capod songs Again only buy the Silver model because whenif you get silver you are guaranteed to get aluminum not thermoplastic Best EVER Doesnt break profound ease of use and does exactly what all others promise but dont do Great for smaller hands,positive
if you like this guage youd like these I just tried them just to try but Ive confirmed I like heavier gauges they are ok,neutral
I feel like this picks dirt off my guitar strings better than the Taylor cloth I also have in the case Good microfiber material gentle on the guitar strings,positive

I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX it comes with 100 set effects I have been doing home recording with Cubase and Logic using a Presonus Firebox audio interface with both MIDI vocals and instruments and didnt use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b I had more inputs and outputs than the Firebox could easily handleThis mixing board didnt look that impressive to me when I first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly The fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus The fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus But basically it works well the EQ is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer Behringer makes a range of models with lessmore inputs to suit ones needs so this is great Also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as I can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what I want to record Another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero And there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything Well I would have liked some of these things but then I would have to pay more and what I really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the Behringer Xenyx has delivered thus farBy the way I am running the following through the mixer an AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic an Alesis QS81 guitar via linein or micd two KRK RP5 studio monitors Presonus Firebox Everythings been working and sounding great thus far Since Im using Logic the effects are basically unnecessary but if I ever want to use the board for live use which I may do they could come in handy Id say the effects are just soso Surprisingly good for the price,positive
Not much to screw up Good quality parts on an essential product Braindead simple install And no surprises works like a champ Gotta have it,positive
If youre going to use this as an insert effect into any amp the first thing you need to do is turn off the amp modelAlthough I liked the presets in the MS50G none of them worked in my rig The first thing that I did when I brought it home was to make a different single patch for each effect The big question is 34Why34 especially since its designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously The answer is I like my overdrive distortion and compressor but I couldnt make up my mind on delays choruses flangers fuzz and its always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortionsThis is the 4th pedal on my board sitting behind a ModTone Lemon Squeeze Compressor TC Electronics MOJOMOJO overdrive and a Wampler Sovereign distortionI give it 5 stars because it accepts pedals well and it serves so many different needs Normally I have it set as just a chorus pedal but occasionally I use it as an additional overdrive or distortion Its great to be able to plug in whatever I need and know that the sound quality is going to be greatIt takes a moment to level match each patch so the transition is smooth and at some point I may take the few remaining slots and make them combinations but as of yet I really havent had the need a great utility pedal and a must if youre just getting started on your pedal board and youre not sure of what pedal you want where This will help you figure things out and if youre not careful it may find a permanent home A great jack of all trades,positive
I liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great The texture almost looks fake though pretty nice,positive
For the money I have no complaints The enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable Not true bypass but none of the BOSS pedals are It doesnt suck tone This pedal isnt the endall beall overdrive but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals dont You lose a little low end when it is engaged but that actually works pretty well for leads especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of classic distortion encountered with EL84s As a stand alone overdrive I prefer other pedals But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp You get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right Like any overdrive you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations Lately I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive Timmy Clone very very nice or the Behringer BO100 which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo As with any overdrive this thing will not sound very good IMHO running into a solid state amp Thats just not what it was intended to do It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV Because Im a cheapskate and because these things are durable like bricks I bought it used for 20 but it is well worth the new asking price Nice pedal,positive
Received the unit plugged it into my Alesis Q25 tested it in Logic Pro X and it works fine The pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase Works Fine,positive
They sound pretty good They tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments They sound great,positive
Great capo Ive tried a lot of other capos including some pretty expensive brand name capos and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings Nice,positive
I bought this strap for a ESP EC1000 Les Paul style guitar I was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price When I got the strap I was impressed The locks work perfectly and fits my guitar The back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they dont harm the finish on your guitar Locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open Its not going to unlock on you Strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding Good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar Long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable Fantastic Strap Could Use A shoulder Pad,positive
Works just fine for the Tascam DP008 I also bought through Amazon and saves a lot of batteries What else can you say It works Its a PS,positive
Great strings the strings on my Epiphone Les Paul wore out so i bought these my ukulele sounds better than when i first bought it Kinda wish they came in black the white contrasts with the color of my uke Made my Ukulele Sound Much Better,positive
Just picked up the Korg pitchblack from Guitar Center yesterday I use a Snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise love the thing so far its accurate fast fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price i like the multiple display options and calibrations Mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe great buy i am happy with it i got it in red Skip the Boss and get this one,positive

Look no further this is the best Booster with an internal EQ what else can you ask for Go for it if you need a versatile small booster it comes with a 9v battery IT ROCKS,positive
I like the size of the stand and the flexibility Easy to put together and holds my guitar very well GOOD MINI STAND TO HAVE,positive
Very transparent with great sustain and a hint of 34dirty34 boost if you crank the knobs to maxBuilt well sounds good and does what youd expect Comparable to MXR Dyna Comp,positive
With some trials using different tubes this pedal can add something that is very tough to get otherwise I run my guitar direct because I dont like amps or having to cart the things around There are so many shades of tone available that its tough to really praise this gadget enough especially considering the low cost I also found using a compresser before it helps I have a Pigtronix Philosophers Tone it made a big differrence I highly reccomend this tube preamp encourage trying out different tubes to get the sound you want Fantastic Tube Preamp,positive
solid good stand it is decent quality and doesnt have any places that will break easily can take anywhere you want solid stand,positive
These picks are nice but just too small My only regret is that I had taken more time to research the size They work well just need to be a little bigger Nice but,neutral
Although it does exactly what it saysit will hold your items together pedals to pedalboardit is significantly thicker than I expected which makes it difficult to use properly without covering the entire board I purchased one strip and I will use it on my backup board but I dont plan to purchase any more Bulky,neutral
Good solid construction It hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised ie removes the pops from vocal recordings Solid construction,positive
While the case is made of plastic the construction is solid and seems very durable My disappointment is with the sound I never could dial in a sound that made me feel like it enhanced the sound of my bass It was just different Ive switched to using the builtin compressor in my Digitech BP90 instead Disappointed,neutral
Have been a user of Jazz III picks lately Max Grip versionDunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks 6 Pack but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strummingWas recommended to these picks by other users so I gave them a shot A few of my notes This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above I like this a lot The tip is almost exactly the same size but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger Still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick The rubber grip area is a joy to hold Very comfortable very stable lots of grip If you didnt know Dava picks dont come in varying thickness They are instead control picks Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid Look at the picture see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick Those are reference markers choke up on the pick lowest line near the tip for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory However even choking up on the pick it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii These Dava Jazz come in three colors Red Delrin material Yellow Nylon material Orange Gel Different materials produce different soundsfeels Also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other twoHope this review helped Great alternatives to Jazz IIIs,positive

As Ive heard with the Pyle Pro amps I received mine today and it was defective Only one channel worked and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep The packaging was very good though so Im thinking this looks like a refurbused and they listed it as new Already printed the return shipping label and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday Defective,negative
I had the ones that came with my strat which I believe are Schallers I like the security of the Schallers better because even if the pin is pulled they arent going to let your guitar loose However my problem with the Schaller is that it would always unscrew the neck screw I had to tighten it after every other use and let me tell you not a little loose but a lot looseWith the Ernie Balls there was no redrilling which is needed with Strap Lock and the EBs screw is good and long You also dont have to put them together like the Strap Lock which is a bit of a painThese have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern Id have rated 5 stars if the plastic you push together to insert and release was knurled That would make it easier to grab and use These will now be my default locks The quality of the nickel is very good too Almost perfect,positive
This is a cheaply built cable It has basic ends they screw on but seem to come loose and need tightening frequently The only truly redeeming feature of this cable is its tiny length 3 feet I use it with my Honey Tone Belt portable ampDanelectro N10A Honey Tone Mini Amp in Aqua so the cable has to be short The amp is on my belt I use it thus just like Jackson and Cole reviewers below Like Jackson I have a RISA solid body electric ukuleleLet me say three feet is short very short If you want to put the amp down on the floor youd better be a short and b siting right over it because when you find out how limiting three feet cable really is youll recognize that you can only use this for one thing a portable amp close to or on your bodyI suppose you could use it to connect a couple of guitar pedals and not have too much cable but them again most connector cables are even shorterGlad I have it only for the purpose I intended Wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables So so guitar cable,neutral
I bought this to try out on my baritone ukeIt works great and is very easy to useI use it with my Fender MustangI had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my Martin DX1I was able to attach it to the smoother HPL back and sides using the suction cupI wet it before attachingYou could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc for trouble mountingIt could be used on just about any instrument Some may need a clampIt picks up anything it is attached toIt will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the ampPretty coolNice price I like it,positive
I love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years I still own a few my favorite being the first Super Champ from the early 80s Rivera nailed that one I naturally prefer tubes for that true tone but tried one of these out last year at a pals place and was sold within two minutes I bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then I can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp Ive ever usedFor the money its a crazy deal I have never once used the included online stuff or the Ableton software so those add even more value to this package no doubt All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone and this is that and plenty more My alltime favorite tone is the clean glassy Fender late50searly 60s sound typified by the Bassmans and Twins and Deluxes of the preCBS era That tone needs tubes to really sing but to my amazement the amp modeling of this Mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes Youll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there especially on the Bassman settings My Strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings and my PRS absolutely smokes with real leasebreaking volume on SuperSonic dial the gain way back for a nice lowthrottle roarHaving gain volume and master lets you dial in a TON of tones with each amp model and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorustremolo etc plus various reverbsdelays etc though I find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by if I cant get the tone I want with my fingers then I need to learn how to is my motto And this amp is so accurate that I canAbove all this Mustang is MUSICAL For a small amp thats a real feat but for 100 clams its a near miracle Add a built in tuner the most useful extra ANY amp can have good effects great amp models the software and more online amp models which Ill get around to one day but so far I get all the tone I need from the amp as it is plus 20 watts for lots of headroom and this is a straight up steal for a billThe only thing missing is serious bass at volume but this is an 8 after all not a 10 so youll always miss some of the real bottom But whats there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides You could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppyAll told the Mustang I is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now Crate and Line 6 etc dont come close but paired with a miniStrat this would be the absolutely PERFECT beginners set up for a kid looking to play anything from the Beatles to Metallica and everything in betweenCant recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone cant come in a small solid state amp It can it does and its cheaper than I can still believeFender truly went to 11 on this oneLeo would be proud Best cheap amp of them all,positive
I always love to DAddario strings on my 6 string guitars so I decided to order these for my new 12 string Ovation 245 They sound great Of course guitar strings can be a personal preference Over the years I have been experimenting with various makes and I always seem to return to these This does not mean I will not try others I surely will continue to experiment I am one to change the strings on my guitars on a very regular basis I spend my Summer in Canada and Winters in Florida and I can assure you that the climate is much drier in Canada than Florida Strings on my guitars left behind in Florida for the Summer will deteriorate quickly even if they are in a humidity controlled environment I find the DAddario strings will stay in better condition than others Great Guitar Strings,positive
Dont buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand It is barely workable for twoIt is easy to set up but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place And you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floorgroundThe best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back For Les Paul and Strat type axes their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow stick like feet of the stand especially when they are new You cant tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet wont support enough weight to make that possible So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand If you just gotta buy something from On Stage get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced But really you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hangThis is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for A Complete Joke,negative
This bag works perfectly for the Digitech RP 1000 or pedals of the same size I also use it for an older Digitech pedal and works like a charm The construction seems to be sturdy and so far I ve had no problems with the zippers The side pocket is very convenient to store lines and plugs and the handles are very comfortable Very good product Simple no nonsense gig bag,positive

Works great for my acoustic dreadnoughtIf I had any complaint it would be that theres nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall It would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger a little cushion that would go between the wall and the guitar No reason I cant make something like that on my own thoughEdit 9242013 Just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck wont fit into this hanger Nothing worth complaining about but just something to note if you need a hanger for a classical guitar this isnt it Nice price nice product,positive

I play in small tight places Sometimes People dance right in front of us I actually bought one of these for my partner because for some reason he would put his stand high and only use 13 of his boom to hold his microphone the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth Despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently he wouldnt and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancersWhen I saw this I thought it would make a nice christmas gift He does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reasonI bought one for myself as well and I do like it The plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though It comes apart quite easily My only complaintWhat I do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesnt slip down at all I personally love that because I have had Boom arms that 34Go Limp34 and their is nothing more annoying Keeps people from bumping my extruding Boom arm,positive
this strap works fine on my Fender Strat it is reasonably comfortable I was disappointed in that it does not fit the pegs of my Zager acoustic otherwise it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap good for the money but does not fit all guitars,positive

I have tryed a number of picks and the textured ones seem to work for me I have dexdarity problems Regular picks without grips come out of my hands cause I am unable to control them So I needed something with a little more weight to it allthough my fingures want to move around a little bit I love these picks now I can move my thumb and index fingers back to the bottom of the pick and it feels comfortable I used to do that with other non textured picks And I kept droping themThese picks are a must have allso sinse theire heavier then other picks these and the Ice picks really build up Your hands And fingersI love these picks Im defintley getting some more GREAT PICK,positive

I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar I have learned a few songs but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago The Fender and the Deans were very nice I thought the Deans had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well I couldnt figure out the different tunings on it though It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal The other ones must be for some special type of music But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Deans It is also very easy to hold unlike the Deans I have found The Deans also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus But this is a very nice beginners guitar if your just looking to get started I would stay away from those Fender knockoffs and stuff like that and get this guitar I also got the cheap Rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes All in all a very nice bargain Excellent beginners guitar,positive
Ive ahd this cable pair for more than 2 years and have had no problems with them at all I used them with both dynamic and condenser microphonesHere are their key points Good quality construction Secured heads VERY long cable NO signal problems Overall great cable Buy with confidence Had for a while No problems at all,positive
Not as good as the G7th line of Capo but they are about half the price I bought this for a 12 string Jumbo acoustic guitar and I was thrilled with the way it sounded So I will probably be using it on my electrics But like I said it good for the price Good capo for the price,positive
These are great cables The only con I could give is if they go badno opening up the ends to fix them but in my experience they are durable Most people are using these on a pedal board so theres not a lot of movement to wear them down Good cables,positive
I just cant trust it I thought itd be a good idea if I needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minutebut I just cant get myself to do it I always end up using a little Fender portable stand It does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp Not as helpful as it would appear to be,neutral
I am not hard on cables I typically just plug them in to my guitar dont move around much and play for an hour or two a day this one seem to perform just fine no buzz andor other noises noted I have several of them and they have all performed well gets the job done,positive
I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here but the warranty Blues reputation and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try And in general Im pretty satisfied with it Using it with one of my Oktava MK301 microphones I get excellent sound no hum and so far excellent reliability Im using it with Audacity and a few other programs none of which have any difficulty recognizing it There were some issues setting it up initially and Im a bit leery about the plastic construction but for what I paid I think its a good value For those thinking of using it in field recording stick it inside a carrying bag and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector You shouldnt have any problems Pretty good for the money,positive

I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issueIts a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup Action is incredible Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsiveHardware is slightly better than expected for this price point Incredible Deal,positive

While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship the Beta 58A needs to be given its due The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin That is the Beta 58A in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high or really any notes the Beta is a dream This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or popping complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into itWhile I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment Quite honestly I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin the SM58 but it is worth every penny Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority Six out of five stars Beyond fantastic,positive
Had it for about two weeks and Im about to return it nowThings that I liked1 Its a classic Fender and I was looking for something of good quality with great price2 Sounds clear and crystal good unplugged3 This can be subjective but I think this BulletStrat is more comfortable than a Les Paul simply because its wider and thinner4 All the previous four ratings here on Amazon and even higher ratings on Musicians friendThings I dont like much1 15th fret of lower E string is dead and like always I take quality control into my rating accountI dont want to bother go to a local shop for a fix never mention thats 20 in addition2 I couldnt figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound like not a bit Im new to electric but my Les Paul does change tunes in a much much more obvious way3 Talking about plugged sound its no where close to unplugged Notes are pretty mixed up and not separatedclear very loud though4 I dont know if its universal I ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches Whats worse is they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove I not even sure if I can call it a protective cover because its pretty weak and thinThis is overall an OK guitar consider its price it can be made at least slightly better For beginners on budget with less than 200 I would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price For example me I got a SX Deimos 175 Les Paul which Im in love with now Simply everything about it is better and I finally get the feelings of an electric Im glad I dont need to stuck with this anymoreAccording to Amazon3 Stars Its OK4 Stars I like it5 Stars I love it3 Stars Checked it really IS just an OKAY guitar to meThanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars Do I expect TOO MUCH,neutral

Ive got three of these to hold an acoustic a mini strat and a jazzmaster while I had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former I was somewhat leary about the later its quite a bit heavier than the other two but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart I have been trusting it Do Not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a fullsize electric and I have my doubts about those plugs the hanger will hold but the drywall might not get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument I used a different setup 10 philips slotted round heads would have actually been better to fix them to a nice piece of 34 x 6 x 6 pine and screwed that into the studs with some 25 12 screws Needless to say its not going anywhere As a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wallOK one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a Jazzmaster Ok but a bit flimsier than expected,neutral
I was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from Joyo but took a chance on the EQ I really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should I use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the EQ but it can be used to get a scooped sound mids boost hilowpass or whatever you need Its a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass When the pedal is engaged the 6 lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enoughI would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed Not the performance side of the pedal as far as I can tell but for example the N on the IN label on the right is backwards and it comes in a weird box with plenty of Engrish so Im skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on Time will tell but for now it seems like a great box for the money Nice little EQ,positive
The Planet Waves Capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did I tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other Capos I used this capo on a Gibson J40 Hummingbird and a J200 I played it finger style and strummed with a pick The device is very well made and really looks like the best capo I own However the sound left something to be desired There was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless unless I really cranked down on the adjustment then is was still dull but passable It was a little better on electrics I tried it on a Les Paul and a Telecaster it was OK but not the best of the bunch I do like the built in pick holder To compare this I tried a G7 capo Kaiser and Schubb Frankly the only one I really am happy with is the Schubb It looks better than it works for me,neutral

I was afraid poor quality would come with the low price but I did an AB comparison with one of my expensive oxygen free yada cables and I could not tell a difference I was playing an American made guitar through an American made tube amp so this was a legit sound test Im sure the plastic on the ends of the plugs will not last as long as a more expensive cablebut who caresbuy a new one Love the coil love the price Love this cable,positive

After suffering through crackles lost signals and all the rest I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazoncom Because the new acousticelectric classical I received as a gift has an endpin outlet I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks I am very impressed The connections on all the guitars and basses on which Ive used it are sure with no loss of signal no crackles Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal Finally I can be confident that when I play something will consistently come out of the amplifier By the way the oldschool tweed look is a plus too Outstanding Cable,positive
This capo works just fine The only downside is the same as with most caposit requires some finetuning to get it work on different guitars The only one Ive found that doesnt is the Kysermy go to capo for years Because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs electric thin neck vs thick etc easily The only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of useThis capo has a similar pinch design springloaded but doesnt adjust as easily to different guitarneck sizes It has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs This allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation but at the expense of ease of use Its certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming but its not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songsSo all said I still prefer my Kyser It allows for much faster changing which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy But this might be a better option if youre in a studio or wont ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time or dont plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place Works fine,positive

First of all I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal I will tell you my wah pedal storySeveral years ago I bought a Crybaby GCB95 and even though I did not use wah very much at the time I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year Fortunately it never gave out on me during a gig but it was only a matter of time Finally I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completelyA couple years ago I bought a Digitech XP100 whammy wah mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morellos style Since it has some digital wah patches was available I started to use them too and was happy because it doesnt have a treadle that will break like on my GCB95 The wahs were usable but just did not sound as goodFinally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains Man in the Box and the Digitech was just not going to cut it So it was time to get a real wah I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used I chose the 535Q because people told me that theyve never had a maintenance problem with them and it is very versatileYou can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dialsand they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles That setting works will in songs like RATM Bulls on Parade as well including to create the white noise for scratch DJ soundsI still do not use wah pedals terribly often but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs I think that as long as I need a wah pedal this one will suit my needs in many styles and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years It is definitely one to consider and the price is not that bad If you are thinking of Crybaby this is the one,positive

I have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar as thats what I learned on as a child I cant afford it at the moment so I decided to give these a shotThese do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination I didnt expect them to but a guy can dream cant heAnyway what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overlybright Takamine It also helped with the rather high action They play and sound softer Its almost like having a new guitarDuring the stringingstretching process I broke the G string go easy they are silk after all and so had to use a standard bronze replacement I asked my nonmusic oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the oddball string and she got it right on the first try thats how much of a difference these strings make They sound less metallic that may sound obvious but my point is that its a big difference enough for her untrained ears to hearIm still saving up for a classical but I really love these strings and will be using them on my Tak going forward Very happy to have found these,positive
This is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder why didnt i think of that it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down every few weeks keeps the strings clean and best of all I dont find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since I started using this instead of the cheesecloth I used to use Works like a charm on my mandolin,positive
I read mixed reviews of this pedal board but I had tried half a dozen multi effects pedals and modeling processors and pedals with limitless combinations all in one However I found all of those too difficult to adjust to my needs or too cumbersome to flip through all the channels to get to the sound I wanted and then modify it What I wanted was four or five single effects pedals that I could preset to the value I usually use and then turn on each effect as needed giving me lots of combinations I had a couple of Boss pedals and one Behringer one and I ordered a couple more of the inexpensive Behringer units which Im generally pleased with though theyre perhaps not in the elite category They work fine for me I didnt want 5 or 6 units cluttering up the space and each demanding its own wall wartThis compact board with its built in case and cord management was the perfect solution for me Instead of the Velcro found on many boards this has foam cutouts which hold the B and B pedals securely and give enough room for the connectors and daisy chain power supply to stay tangle free It all plugs in with one adapter provided and it also comes with all the short connectors to connect each pedal togetherMy pedals are incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now The case holds them securely and the lid fits on and holds everything in place for transport Everything is ready to play by just removing the lid and plugging into the outletThe latches are not the most secure just a simple plastic slide that looks like it could easily break However there are matching holes right next to them so a small lock or even a twist tie could be inserted if the latch does malfunctionOverall Im extremely satisfied If youre doing something similar to me Im sure you will be too The foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals I have exactly enough to fill it with the addition of a dedicated tuner that mutes everything while I tune Works great for the number and size of pedals,positive
I play bass in a lot of different environments and I never know what to expect before I show up If I am playing a venue where I can use my head and 4x12 combo I know Ill have great tone If I am going direct into the board I am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer This unit gives me the ability to still go direct but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth I suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try I love it Must have for working bassists,positive

This is a good pick They give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely However they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot After trying a few others I settled on Wegen Picks They make the Golden Gates sound bleak in comparison Wegens definitely click less are easier to grip and bring out the natural woody sound and character of the instrument If you are looking for something that will progress with you you may wish to look elsewhere Not bad for starters,neutral
This is a good quality microphone The sound quality is good in the various modes although I have used it primarily in cardioid and stereo modes Its easy to set up Under Windows 7 all I had to do is plug it in The instruction manual hasnt been updated in years and gives instructions for Windows Vista and XP The instructions for Vista are mostly accurate for Windows 7 but I found that the default settings are better than the recommended settings in the instructions Also there is no driver supplied by the company The Microsoft driver will work fine and there might not be a sonic advantage to making their own driver But it means that there is no custom control panel and you have to use the more obscure Windows ones Also the icon for the microphone doesnt match the product which isnt really a big deal Its just a matter of attention to detail The instruction manual is in English and French but the warranty information is in French in both places They both say there is a two year warranty and give a phone number in the Los Angeles area Theres a copy of the actual warranty on their website although it does have terms that violate US law so I have no idea how they handle actual warranty issuesThe only real negative I experienced when setting up was that it interfered with my keyboard Im using a fairly standard Logitech wireless keyboard and it experienced a lag and not all letters showed up when I typed I unplugged the USB cable for the microphone and things went back to normal Repeating the process yielded identical results After rebooting the computer the problem went away Hopefully there wont be long term issuesThe bottom line is that not a single problem related to the quality of the microphone itself which works well is very clear and is extremely sensitive It will pick up a whisper from 15 feet away with the same clarity as if I were sitting two feet in front of it Thats with volume settings that work clearly when I really am two feet in front of it The down side is that it will pick up every stray sound from letting your hand rub your shirt to letting your feet rub the carpet But those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself Bargain mic with a few issues,positive
I got the Ocean Turqouise and they are stunning 4 for these 12 beautiful premium quality picks is a steal Beautiful Picks,positive
Bought Verbzilla Digitech RV7 and the verbzillas ripoff Behringer RV600The types of reverb i get from Verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths so for that many kind of modes barely useful And I HATE the fact that line 6 always used the MIX knob instead of the separated level and reverbfx level cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb which is sucksThen i tried the digitech rv7 First thought was Wow what a construction its got there Fancy knobs and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover velcro glow in the dark sticker And the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it I love this one better than the verbzilla cos you dont have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb but the problem was theres no heavy reverb there I couldnt get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal But I love the gated reverb feature among all modes Every other modes are just nothing special really It was just a light reverb i getAaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal skeptical at first and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has I was a little disappointed But I really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one And Im very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does It could be painful for guitar players cos they cannot boost up your guitar volume without anything else if its already full but I could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full I could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and its hell loads of themLet me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that ive tried they are ALL battery hogs It was ridiculous i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 510 mins of nonstop use of battery before its dried up So I suggest you to use the power adapter And the only thing i hate about RV600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to its place cos we have to put the spring back to its track while closing it slowly and that black plastic latch on the side doesnt feel it could last longI dont care what ppl said about this pedal but its been very useful for me and my synthesizers we dont need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds Its all comes back to our ability to make good music Good luck guys Best inexpensive reverb pedal for synthesizer,positive
These strings are okay but nothing special except for the price which is a factor when changing twice a week I dont play enough to need changes that often anymoreSo Ive become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar This doesnt mean that these strings are bad it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because theyre darker and Brand Y Steels on another because theyre brighter and Brand Z on yet anotherSo give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least if you want your instrument in top shape A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good Like emDont Love em,positive
They feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them Fair priced and I love the color of the green ones I like the 88 mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard great for someone looking to play blues or rock Cheap and easy to use cant beat these picks Favorites,positive
I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didnt have to The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me So its like that guy who asks for a lighteruses itand puts it in his pocket every single time these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighterI understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbersIts a decent tool at a good price so buy oneThen see how long you can own it Very UsefulBUT,positive
This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years It really does have a ton of range although it only does one effect at a time so youd have to reach down and change the knobs midshow in order to get the other variations My most commonly used setting was with the overdrivedistortion mix knob at about 2 oclock which produces a very professional sounding Grungetype effect If you want any of those 90s sounds excluding the heavier metal sounds this pedal will definitely get you there Versatile,positive
Ordered these guitar picks for my son The picks were exactly as described We ordered the blue color which is dark blue with a lighter shiner blue design on top of it It is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy He is very pleased with these picks The appearence is pleasing and it is made well very pleased with the quality We will be purchasing more picks in the future Highly recommend Great Guitar Picks,positive
In fact I dont think this Hosa GTR215R cord lasted 2 hours One step on the cord and it came apart This purchase is the very reason why Im looking to buy a wireless system Maybe if youre using this to run a PA I would recommend it But if any performer is hard on their cords I wouldnt recommend this itembut to be fair I would recommend wireless to any performer Youll end up saving money over the long haul Didnt last a day,negative
Great guitar strings and affordable I have used these for quite a while and I have always liked them Recently I moved to Boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly They never used too Its not that humid here so I dont know if I got some bunk strings or if the quality has gone down in the last year or if really its the Boston weather Historically I have sworn by these though Great strings only minor problems,positive
Pretty disappointed in the color As the review title indicates what I received is more of a black chrome or dingy stainless color These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for Perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguardI ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad Some are very dull looking Very disappointing really Pretty dark color for chrome maybe black chrome in the wrong package,negative
This has saved my bass drum head from many holes Also has no affect on sound of bass drumWould recommend Works great,positive
Wow the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry but plug in some real mics and voila the DR40 becomes something special But I do not always want to carry around so much equpment and was hoping for better internal micsHonestly my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thingAnd WHY is the lineout so darn noisy Must be defective Oh well Gonna have to send this back Internal mics are atrocious,negative
You know the problem with 9v wall warts is that noise in the signal can be a problem I am powering my 9 unit pedal board with this adapter and it works great I have used it some at lower voltages but only on my older analog pedals I wouldnt reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage The cord is a little wimpy compared to my Boss PSA adapter but it is acceptable Good Quiet Power Supply,positive
One thing tho When your guitar isnt in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere I am going to be finding picks in my files for years Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it Great idea,positive
These cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums They appear to hold up well under constant moving I will be getting more Good Quality Cable,positive
The version I picked came with a grounding wire claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostaticproducing snap crackles and pops If you believe that continue to do so and maybe youll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device Speaking more pragmatically Ive found some use for the item only when loose conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc Belief is the key,negative
Very nice case for the price Solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my Epiphone LP Would definately recommend Love it,positive
This is a perfect compliment to my current set up I needed a desktop stand for voice overs when my usual recording set up wouldnt do the trick This stand is sturdy and worked perfectly A great buy as the price was perfect as well Perfect Compliment,positive
I m obviously not a 34Techie34 I couldnt understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldnt work until I found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane AhaTo be fair I must explain that the battery was already installed in the tiny little amp when it arrived so I didnt look too closely at it But of course when I couldnt get it to work for me I soon discovered the problemThis product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyesand will astound you with its capacity to roar out your music when turned up fully and respond immediately to your slightest touch on its sweet little knobs to sound out your music from there and down to a whisper whenever you require it toThe sound from the speaker is as clear as a bellno static at allTruly an amazing little gadget attractive so portable and does the job of one twice or more of its size Neato Love this mini giant of a speaker,positive
I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store Who doesnt need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right The price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesnt work very well The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate It gets you in the ballpark but just barely Strike a note once and its sharp Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better Does the trick just barely,negative
I do like these strings Had a few packs of these from Christmas Opened up one recently and the 009 string or 1st string Was Not in there Next time Im gonna have to open up the package to make sure theyre all in there should measure them too Didnt open them to keep them sealed until I was ready to use them no more Just wish the package was transparent,positive
Only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not but it sounds great as ampeg always has heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp more than what i expected,positive
I bought this to have at home or when I travel my full size stand stays at church I have a new Martin 12string that I did not want lying on the floor This folds flat maybe 28221 thick has a wide secure base and fits in the bag I carry my other gear in quite well Convenient and stable,positive
I tried this model a few years ago and I never had a problem with them once I got it installed but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments I thought and this has been mentioned by others that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument which I thought looked goofy I also didnt particularly care for the push button release and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge these have a C clamp not a nut so theres no allowance for differing thickness I also felt safer with the Schallers which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didnt depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together As I said I had no real problems with them so if they look like theyd work for you great As with all replacement strap locksbuttons you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers dropped out of airplane or what have you I Prefer Scahllers,positive
This is a good quality strap It is wide and has leather ends It fits my Les Paul 100 just fine and I am sure it willlast a long time with normal useCant go wrong for the price Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap Black,positive
I bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar It showed up on amazon when I was doing a search for Bass Guitar amps other regular guitar amps were not showing up so I was curious about it After a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations I thought I would give it a try because some people say yes others said no I wanted to test for myself While I did get sound and was able to practice it didnt have anywhere close to the tone I was hoping for So I ended up returning it the next day Im not upset about the amp itself just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search which is the only reason I gave it a shot For a regular guitar this would be fine but not bass I which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up I was in the market for a practice amp for under 100 and was hopeful but what I ended up doing was buying a used Acoustic B20 1X12 Bass Combo Amp for the same price as this new practice amp and I am a lot more satisfied Again this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar not regular guitar Not ideal for bass even though it shows up on a bass amp search,negative
So i decided to amplify my Martin Dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar I didnt want to spend a lot if it just wouldnt sound good with a pickup and saw this had consistently good ratings I cant speak for other acoustic pickups but this far exceeded my expectations and I dont plan on buying a more expensive piezo or soundhole pickupATTACHING ITUnfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the endtail block and I didnt want to drill a new hole in my notsocheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickupSo I attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge and just ran the cable out from the sound hole The jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape which is kind of like really strong gum it can be removed without leaving sticky residue which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as I dont jerk the guitar quicklySOUND QUALITYI plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa The package mentions two locations you can place the pickup and because I needed to run it through the sound hole I could only place it where more treble is picked up So I have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to 7 or lowerBecause the pickup is a transducer no electrical feedbackinterference is picked up so the sound will be very clear and crisp It would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding the only noise I get even at max gain max input volume is from the amp itself heard with every instrument I plug into it if I turn the master volume up too highAnother thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations so it wont pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body but will when touching it So with that in mind the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body like it brushing up against your body a zipper hitting the guitar your fingers sliding on the strings etc Blown away Comprehensive review,positive
Ive tried the Fishman FT1 and the Tune Tech ttm201 I like this one the bestIt seems as accurate as my other tuners Like all clip on tuners there are sweet spots on the head that work better than others Oddly the Snark likes different spots from the Fishman or Tune Tech I tested the Snark against them my Korg tuner and my Android App tuner The Snark was fineThe biggest plus I see on the Snark and the reason its my new go to tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen My vision isnt so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful I dont have to guess or squintIt has a metronome which can be fun I personally dont use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so I dont want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when I really need itThe only minus that I can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce I dont have a custom made Brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing If you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure youll trust it If not then the Fishman is more your speed Best of many that Ive tried,positive
I am a professional touring and recording artist OMEB who typically sings through a beta 58 I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringers products Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one At 25 I figured I could chance it I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show The mic was much hotter than the 58 better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies As far as durability that is the question but if you are looking for a great mic that doesnt cost 160 bucks this is your mic Outstanding,positive
I wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since I have mostly Behringer products and am more than satisfied with my other pedals decided to try the CO400 Again I am more than satisfied A chorus isnt something you use all the time so I expect this one to give me years of good Behringer reliability and service For someone looking for that extra color in your sound try this pedalI think youll be pleasantly surprised and you sure cant beat the price A great value for your money pedal board addition,positive
It works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy the top part spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again alright,positive
I bought this for my brother for a Christmas gift when we got him a guitar He never used it but not because of anything to do with the actual product It is what it is,positive
I already had two Behringer stompboxes and am thinking of adding a few more so I thought rather than having a mess on the stage Id get a pedalboard I hadnt really studied them too much except to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth Then recently I found this one for less than a hundred bucks so I really couldnt pass it up I am very impressed with this unit It is well made well designed and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories Nothing is lacking to start playing right away Im not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit but I think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have I am not disappointed in the least I think you will like this board This is the one,positive
I was using the bigger triangle kind before The one thats more universal But I only use the tortex pics So I got this They fit perfect And they dont move around so much like with the bigger triangle one Perfect,positive
Ive ordered two of these kits in the aged white and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate Literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor accidentally stepped on them and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale The knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however Why No Protective Covering For The Back Plate,negative
I bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with He really likes it a lot It keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely Nice,positive
Hosa guitar cables work great Never had any problems with them I own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect Good cables,positive
For me thia is the best cables ever i mean they give the original and natural tone of ur instrument doesnt lose signal strenth and a very important thing they do help to avoid most noise the best cables ever,positive
I have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars I absolutely love them Great quality very strong and great variation of length on them They are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders I highly recommend this strap Great Guitar Strap,positive
Easy upgrade Fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners Make changing strings a whole lot easier Glad I did it Easy upgrade,positive
This is just an excellent product I have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it I will keep using it You only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you dont need to use it for every polish Once you put it on initially you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back There is enough in one bottle to last a very long timeI highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the Dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards The lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well When it dries your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks 50 stars Excellent Product,positive
been using it for a month or 2 now had absolutely no problemsgood constructiolooks goodangled end is a good fitprice is good no problems,positive
I bought this for one of my heavier 5strings as a replacement strap and love it I use that particular bass for slap and usually hang that bass higher on me that the others for good slap technique This strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortableGood Strap OH WHAT A RELIEF IT IS,positive
The only complaint I have about this is that theres no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over This probably doesnt matter to all of yall though Other than that its a very nice machine with a flashing light and two 34click34 options Easy to use and quality built Pegleg Helps Me I tend to speed up,positive
Forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand Doubt Ill use the strap but then again I probably will try to use it that way Just as ordered,positive
Just a basic female XLR to 14 inch male adapter I use these so I can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboardpractice all in one PA Works as intended,positive
This jewel does give a Vox AC tone depending how its used For direct recording it does If used with an amp maybe But however you use it it is sweet Absolutely Amazing For The Money,positive
I have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back this was difficult so for the longest time when I had my studio setup I had a mixing board going into the interface It is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine This board is great no sliders which I had to clean The board has all the same features that were on my 8 channel DOD board that I used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk The only thing that I am not keen upon is that there is no onoff switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time It makes the stuff I do in Logic easy This is a home use unit great for the price as well as for its quality good things in small packages,positive
I have used Dunlop Straplocks for 32 years I bought the original style years ago for my Strat Les Paul and Partscaster the last two having the most weightThese things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing I ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitarI suggest these over the other brands watch what touring bands use These things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secureThe price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping I always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping Excellent guitar saving straplocks,positive
These tuners are amazing I like them so much I bought another one They work better than tuners costing ten times as muchYou dont have to be a rocket scientist to use it Its so simple a child can use it The face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark It is extremely accurate This is so much better than my Intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what I paid for the Intellitouch Its very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without It uses one CR2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included You have to install the battery which is no big deal Just read the instructions I recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too Great Tuner Great Price,positive
My classical guitar stand was metal and short like this but did not have the front brace or download slant If I had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken its headstock on the hard flood So sad I mourn it still Wish I had bought this sooner,positive
So perhaps I dont know what shade burgandy really is Or the picture is a bit misleading It is as stated although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven As too DEEs reveiw the buckle doesnt seem to bother me I am not calling him or her out or anything My best guess its playing style I myself play bass when I first started I played on the 3 inch straps and found they bothered me went to the 2 straps proplem solved I am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother But for me and the way I play No complaints Purple and Red had a baby,positive
Im rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR 4 picks into it when it snapped apart I use the Dunlop Tortex 10 mm picks and perhaps thats where I was at fault I maybe should left it at three picksHowever my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holderI give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated Hmmmmmm,neutral
Now I can use the clean channel on my amp with this pedal for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel 2 for my other pedals and my electric guitar With this I can use my 2channel ampfor acoustic and electric guitar,positive
Great pedal Get it You wont be disappointed for basic delay needs Great tone Dont waste your on others with similar specs Awesome basic delay True True True bypassno artifacts,positive
Works very well and is portable Guitar leans pretty far back but I put a sock on it no literally and now the guitar leans at the right angle Not literally a right angle but a very good angle Why do you have to be so difficult Perfect,positive
Easy to use portable cheap Not exact in tuning might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican For most of us this is more than adequate Good and cheap but not exact,positive
These impact pads came very fast and do their job although one of the pad I received ive already warn through in less then 3 weeks Alright,positive
I actually use these on my bass if my fingers are too worn from heavy playing they have the same sound as a finger on a string it is actually a really neat thing to have in my bag I recomend trying one out some time Sweet sound,positive
I was looking for a small high quality monitor for use in the Praise Band at church I needed to run my Boss GT100 and vocals through it on stage This little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume It is built extremely wellvery solid and sounds incredible The volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing I still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and I do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor There is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom but I place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my DI box underneath it Between this and my GT100 I have the ultimate direct guitar system with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board Simply fantastic piece of equipment Exceeded all expectations,positive
I own a Native Instruments Maschine Mikrobut find myself using this even more often You can program it to whatever MIDI values you want The pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive WAY better than expected,positive
A great universal bag I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body Has great pockets to carry your picks strings and tuners The padding is better that I expected It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color The price belies the quality of this bag,positive
I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it I dont know how it would hold up for touring or constant use but it is perfect for my needs as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio You can NOT beat this throne for the price,positive
Great strings I use these on a Deering Goodtime II and they work well Deering recommends as I imagine most entry level banjo manufacturers sticking with only the light gauge not light pluses or mediums So stock up Good strings and not overly prone to corrosion Great strings,positive
Lots of juice easy settings very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need I havent jacked it up all the wayI dont think the cat would appreciate that I get a little feedback every so often occasionally its a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar but not enough to submarine this power packed amp How do you get that much noise out of an 834 speaker Horsepower,positive
I use this adapter on the interfacemix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake to change 1 channel into my monitor return I plug an XLR to Female 14 stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup Now I can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2 Its an 8 channel XLR snake Why do I go through all that you ask because I have an 8 channel XLR snake and instead of buying another snake why not ADAPT the snake I have hence the word adapter P I love it Its a great tool to add versatility to your setup no matter what youre doing Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 14 stereo Its high quality and very solid I definately expect this to last me a long time Versatility,positive
good product good service should be fine for years to comei have one in my main guitar casesesalways close by enjoy great price,positive
I have three uku soprano concert Love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy great,positive
Its working ok not for hard useI just use it on my PC table for karaoke onlinewith phantom mic its well done Your Cable Store XLR 3 Pin Microphone Cable 6 feet,positive
Probably the best kapo out on the market Very high quality and a sleek look Easy to use what more could you want Industry Standard,positive
This is my first tube amp and after doing a TON of research I found that the VOX AC15C1 was just about perfect for meIt came down to the AC15 Fender Blues Jr and the Ibanez TS15 The Blues Jr has a somewhat small enclosure for a 1x12 and I felt it had a bit of a boxy tone otherwise its a great amp The Ibanez has a classic Tube Screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes but it lacked a reverb circuit which was a deal breaker silly reasoning I know The AC15 has a larger enclosure than the Blues Jr and it has a reverb AND tremolo circuit so it had the features I was looking for and most importantly it produces some killer toneIf youve ever seen or read a review of this amp chances are youve heard about the classic VOX chime which this amp has but I fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away The normal channel will break up nicely too but I would suggest an AB switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirtyI was worried at first that 15 watts wouldnt be enough but fear not this amp is LOUD maybe too loud as Im just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom but thats not a bad thing It totally blows away my 100 watt Marshall solid state and I havent put the volume much past 8 Oclock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if I doWhile there is no effects loop it takes pedals well but for distorted tones Ive found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch which Ive come to love so much As stated above the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp or as previously stated running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an AB switch to go between them As far as other effects I really like what it does to my TC Electronic Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus Note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel but it controls the onoff for the built in tremolo and reverb but its sadly not included with the ampFor my first tube amp I dont think I could have done much better I love the tone that I can get the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp its feature rich and takes pedals well The other two amps that I was considering were a little less expensive and while I really feel that the VOX is just a better all around amp I dont think you can go wrong with any one of the threeThe weight about 50 lbs and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that I can think of While I would have picked up all three of the amps that I was looking at if I had the means I would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp Great tube amp,positive
Works as advertised I was a bit skeptical when the product arrived but I just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work Pretty simple even if youre technically challenged Easy to use Havent gigged with it yet but I can imagine that this strap isnt going anywhere regarding its functionality Not a pretty product but good stuff Works as Advertised,positive
As the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more If youre toating between practice with an instructor its okay I purchased it for that reasonand Im an adult so I can be careful This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag It will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent dirt but thats itThere are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price Bare Minimum,negative
I use this boost in the effects loop so its after the preamp section of the amplifier It gives the boost I need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever I will always have one of these on my board Very well made Best Pedal Purchase I made for my board,positive
These strings are just prefect and feel awesome As you can tell from the amount of reviews on this product they are extremely popular and all those people cannot be wrong Favortie,positive
All tuners like this are going to be a little jumpy none of them are perfect This does the job perfectly once you get the hang of itThe Korg Pitchblack was a little out of my price range so the GA40 is working perfect for now Overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand five stars Best 12 spent on a guitar accessory,positive
Great strings fully recommended I have been playing guitar for about 30 years I only use DAddarios Dean Markleys Good sound long lasting DAddario EJ163D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings Light,positive
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars but its just not for me its large and takes up space on my pedal board i prefer the little big muff i would recommend the little big muff,neutral
Simple review hereGood Strings help create Good SoundThese are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well They are not overly bright nor dark but rather have a nice round sound to them Highly recommend Great Strings,positive
Doesnt reduce sound worth a darn I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things Muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in dB Doesnt work for sound reduction,negative
The HoneyTone is aptly named It has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size That reputation is earned It has double the volume of a portable amp I own thats twice its size The tone range is generous from mellow to high treble From what Ive seen and heard the 34overdrive34 function is fairly useless in an amp this size It tends to go distortion to the point of garble My guess is specific guitars may work well with the overdrive but I have no use for it as I prefer clear tones It is possible to overvolume the amp as with any amp so i dont max it out but for a portable or practice amp it works very well Ive bought three of these now and plan to buy more I dont know as Id pay 40 to 60 for it but the Amazon price currently around 20 makes it a great value I hope its around at this price level for a long time as its great for hobbyist projects or for box guitar amping Great amp especially for the price,positive
This unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay Its not so 34digital and bright34 delay like Boss DD3 or DD7 Mod switch adds a perfect 34chorus34 effect for 80s Metal Ballads sound The Analog Delay,positive
I bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction One of the features I like is that it just doesnt take up too much room and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to storeOver all a nice easy to use poratble music stand Perfect music stand for home and on the go,positive
I share another reviewers opinion about this pedal not being comfortable at certain treadle angles However because there is very little output in those lower positions I dont find it to be an issue In fact I rarely feel the need to use the full travel of the treadle when doing volume swells I thought it a bit strange that this thing specifies a 12 volt AC adapter yet can be powered by a 9 volt battery So I decided to see if I would have any issues if I used my OneSpot AC adapter on it polarity corrected of course It worked just fine I usually power my looper with the same adapter so I built a splitter cable with labeled polarity specific terminations and everything worked fine My curiosity didnt end there though I wanted to know if there would be any discernible difference if I used a 12 volt power supply I did it and the only difference I could find was that the power indicator LED was just a wee bit dimmer using the 9 volt adapter There was no change in the sonics whatsoever nor was there a reduction in output volume that I could hear So whats up with the 12 volt adapter spec Behringer Did you think you could fool all of us out here I give it four stars because even though you dont have to use the pedals full sweep it just not very comfortable in those lower positions Ill probably get used to it eventually Au contraire mes Amis You CAN use a 9 volt adapter,positive
Actually i was planning to buy the Boss TU2 or Boss TU3 and i found this one just with 2 mins reading the specification i knew this one is superior in all aspectsSHOULD GET THIS ONEbest 90 i have ever spend Best tuner in the world,positive
These hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws The screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so I would recommend you buy some good screws before you install I have several of these and at least three screws broke as I screwed them into the stud in the wall Great hanger but poor screws,neutral
I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy Keeps things in place one problem The coating will wear out in a short time a few months and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside This might make it a bit hmm I dont want to say hard to lock but youd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure Mine has unclipped a couple times because I didnt check Our climate is humid so its rust friendly which could contribute to why Im having issues However once clipped properly you shouldnt have issues Great buy Good stuff,positive
Ive been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them I figured Id try some others at half the price and see if any stack upThese were the first to go on and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string They were twice as loud as these When you take these out of the pack they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti They dont do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do The cons definitely outweigh the pros hereProsVery flexible string bends are easyEasy on the fingersConsThe most dull sound of any strings Ive ever heard Especially on the low end Theyre dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound The highs are very tinny Almost sounds like a bad recordingYour fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings Its the weirdest thing This is especially true for the G string Its hard to explain but its kind of like rubbing against something really clean where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and theres tons of squeak to boot Anyways it sucks Grip is the last thing you want on your stringsBottom line Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings these should not be purchased Ill never buy again This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings Theyre not my favoriteor even close,negative
I gave this 3 stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating I have nothing to say against the product or the company only that this is NOT a GUITAR CASE It is a MANDOLIN case Amazon should correct thisStagg STB10W Acoustic Guitar BagEpiphone Case for Epiphone Dot Sheraton 335 NOT A GUITAR CASE,neutral
I notice mixed reviews here I suppose when an item sells for 2 instead of 20 there may be a potential for quality control issues But hey buy 3 of them and if even one turns out to be bad youre still way ahead on the deal Seems to me as good as any connector Ive ever bought Mixed reviews,positive
Theres no way to attach the shock mount to it screws for securing it arent provided the holes dont match up etcOh well I went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk insteadIll come up with a use for this arm later otherwise Id have returned itWill NOT hold a Blue Yeti Yeti Pro microphone Just an FYI Slightly dissapointed,neutral
This is my third bench and seems to be the best of them Quick to set up tear down adjust The bench is also larger than my others Very happy for the price 4 different height adjustments Nice Bench,positive
These are really cheap strings but how they sound really good obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse these are the ones So cheap and what a awesome sound,positive
I was able to connect it to my PC There was a horrible delay between the keyboard and the PC but once I installed better midi software CoolSoft VirtualMIDISynth and turned down the delay its nearly realtime I had problems getting it to work on my iMac It recognized the devices presence but it didnt produce any sound on the computer It Mostly Works,neutral
DOAno good out of the boxplug it nothingno way to send it back Im not from the StatesmeaningI just wasted away 40 something bucks add shippingI did bought a Behringer pedal before TremoloPan with good results but I guess theres two sides to this particular low economy pedalsWell Ill man up and buy something else Busted,negative
It is all preference I bought a couple cactus picks and I like the fact they stick to my fingers better These are slick and seem harder to keep track of I like the cactus picks better,neutral
I expected this to come with a DC adapter Nowhere is it mentioned there wouldnt be any or I could have ordered one The product is good surprisingly loud The bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles once the battery popped out by itself when I played a low E but thats no issue I have only used it with a 9V battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain I hope that doesnt happen with an adapter Its a nice little amp good for carrying around If you have long fingers you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along its height its that small A guitar strap a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it The distortion it gives is good Not good for palm muting This is nice for practising Randy Rhoads The Doors type of rock where not many effects are usedAlso remember the DC adapter has a polarity outer ring and inner Many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one Its easy to change the polarity open the box of the adapter and exchange needs soldering obv the red and the black wire places Good amp bad seller Buy 9V DC adapter separately,positive
Im not going to recommend this over the 15 capos Its better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made I decided to try this one out but the construction of it makes it feel like its going to break if I pull it too hard And because of that it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove But once its on it works It works,neutral
The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy fairly easytoassemble and easytoinstall alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty largetheres little chance that these are going to come out The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schallers system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitars body Ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences On an instrument such as a Hofner violin bass though or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support Schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy should provide a long life of service and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors Recommended for most guitar body styles Excellent Strap Lock System With One Small Problem,positive
I use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space They work well and I havent had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises I highly recommend them Plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper 1 cords Great Patch Cables,positive
My home practice area is in a rather dark corner with limited room and I have this clipped onto my music stand Illuminates the music far better than the previous ones I had used including one that used a full sized bulb rather too much light and not very portable Have no trouble that others have mentioned just it loses a star because the included ac adapter cord is short making it for all intents and purposes useless to me without having to string along an extension cord to my music stand ugh more cords Does the job better than other mini lights I have used,positive
I am buying several more to mount on assorted amplifiers for practice room and studio On stage I prefer microphone boom holders Decent Pick holder,positive
I bought one of these for each of my electric guitars 3 and really like them They work great were easy to assemble and not expensive I do think the name is a bit inapproriate because I would never use one on stage I dont think they are sturdy enough These are great if you dont have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them I realize you wont normally have pets or children on stage but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over I recommend the On Stage XCG4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe I use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely Great deal for the very low price Best Bargain,positive
Its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly And ive noticed it helps cut down on excessive noise generated by pedals with when cheaper power sources are in use I wish the power cable for the supply was longer but its nothing an extension cable cant fix Weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down I lt didnt bother me really but if you get the same situation and you cant stand it im sure you coukd just open it up and flip the little switch box around Nice way to keep pedals more organized and reduce noise,positive
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies you will get noise in significant quantities too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation Pay the extra money and get something quiet Others complained about this and they were right If you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap Some complained about each band boosting others This is more of a user problem than manufacturing If you want to isolate a frequency range boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and youll get a narrow range In this respect its like an MXR 6 band OK for experimentation but for less noise go elsewhere,negative
My puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable I bought this to fill the gap until I could by another name brand but since it works so reliably Ill saving my money for other things If the puppy murders this one Ill order up another one just like this Great replacement when you wear out your name brand midi cables,positive
Ive been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time I started playing 15 years ago and used the slim floppy picks for a long time As time went on and my guitar skills grew I needed a pick that was sturdy and wouldnt flex to play more intricate and detailed songsThe tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones I can find I like the soft sandy feel of these They dont slip out of your hand easily and because theyre so thick they take a long time to wear out My favorite picks,positive
You can set up 3 delays configurations what is a interesting option to use on stage Tap function also helps a lot All type of delays are sounds beatiful Powerful delay machine,positive
These strings are really nice They have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark Ernie Ball feel Some reviewers have stated that the strings have a silky feel even comparing them to coated strings but I dont find that to be the case They feel pretty much like any other guitar string albeit much gentler than stainless strings If money were no option Id probably move to these exclusively but at roughly three times the price of good to great nickel strings Im not sure that they are good enough to justify the massive price premium Each string did come inside its own protective sleeve which made restringing easier and is a feature that I absolutely expect from a premium string Great strings but maybe not worth the money,positive
wow wow I cant believe it working wonderfulIm using it karaoke online in paltalkI did compairation with somes I have its perfect vocalI connected it with mixer Alesis 8 inputI wish its built with switch onoffRecomend to buyer Thanks Amazon Behringer XM8500 Dynamic Microphone Cardioid,positive

this is a nice strap Its kinda hard to get on the 1st time because its stiff That turned out to be good good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat it would be sad if your axe fell in your soup prro tec strap,positive

The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards thats well known As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their goto house mics In fact I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater with a highend system that I played at just recentlyI had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two The Beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency rolloff to avoid that boomy muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejectedBuilt like a tank is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shures vocal mics truly earn that title They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter Toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc NO problem When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear its nice to have tools that you never worry about For that reason Id highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal Chances are its in working order no matter what Rock Solid,positive
I read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than I do and since most people seemed to like it I figured Id give it a try I was not disappointed at all It gives you great sound for solos Ive tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that its quite versatile I still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound I want but I think thats just learning about the effects this box provides Great sound for the price,positive
I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo It works It also came with a cordI was not happy the Super Champ X2 didnt come with it Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches And you really need the foot switch to use the X2s various voicings and effects Now the X2 is my main amp Completes your Super Champ X2,positive
I really like this stand I even bought a second one after giving it a try Is solid you maybe need to tight too strong to avoind the weight of the mic to bring the arm down buy I can do thatRecommended Is good,positive

What can I say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal great choice to add some trashy color to my cymbal set up all Wuhans because they are cheap and blow away most of the big boy companies One thing that surprised me was how BIG the sound was and how nice it cut right thru my other cymbals You cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal Placed it on top of my 18 crash and it looks great Excellent China Cymbal,positive
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily just try and leave it on alwaysits cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if youre careful regular,neutral
Very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep Well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals Definetly buy the power supply with it though it just makes it better and easier to use Very nice product overall Very nice sound,positive
I only play Elixir strings They are relatively finger friendly hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings I have played in the past These were for an electric acoustic I just bought which is why I got a lighter string than I normally play I will move to mediums once I get the feel of the guitar Of course they will be Elixirs as well The ONLY Strings,positive
these strings are great for the price they sound nice and are pretty long lasting but dont last or sound as nice as higher end strings but who cares when the strings are affordable these strings are great for people are starting because its cheaper and its not a big deal when you break a lot of strings pretty good for cheap strings,positive
The Elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brandnew sound a lot longer than any other brand I am very happy with the Elixir brand strings Elixir Has Great Strings,positive

This keyboard far exceeded my expectations for the price the quality of most of the bread and butter sounds is very high This keyboard also has tons of neat features theres something here for musicians of any skill level check out Yamahas product blurbTo get an idea of how good this keyboard can sound search YPG235 on YouTube and check out trying out my Yamaha ypg 235 by JoshTheMusician90Since its also 76 keys unweighted MIDIUSB compliant very portable and can even run on batteries in a pinchthe YPG235 could be used in a variety of situationsOne star off for a couple of caveats below Other than that at around 200 this instrument is a stealIn my mind the only negatives aside from trying to install the USB MIDI driversee below are that Yamaha sells this keyboard without the AC adapter and sustain pedal as standard accessories and you really need both Yamaha should note that a lot of people feel burned by the noninclusion of the AC adapterNOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO USE THIS KEYBOARD VIA USBMIDI ON A WINDOWS 7 SYSTEMThe USB MIDI drivers for this instrument are provided on a CD the disk I got only contained drivers up to Windows Vista I tried cheating and using this driver on my WIN 7 system but it didnt work The CD will supply you with a link that should take you directly to the latest driver downloads but it doesnt I ran into a lot of problems going that route I suggest you bypass trying to use the link the CD suggests and just go directly to the Yamaha website to get the latest driver Much easier and my YPG235 now works fine with my computer but still surprising since most USB MIDI keyboards are plug and play Great multipurpose instrument WIN 7 USB MIDI users see note,positive
I love this little item I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it No more hunting for picks anymore When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and its always there when I pick up the guitarPlacement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar I placed mine where Id never rub against it between the amp cord inlet and a control knob Make sure it isnt in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against itI love this and have one coming for my acoustic too only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitarOh I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldnt try to squeeze another on in but thats why you have a gig bag anyway This is a must have item in my opinion Already on my Fender Stratocaster,positive
had no trouble putting them on or getting them in tune great addition to any uku bag i would recommend them great strings,positive

JJs are great tubes This 12AT7 replaced a 12AX7 in the preamp of an Epi Valve Jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone it was very nice but I found an old American made 12AU7 that I like more the JJ is still a great tube JJs are great,positive

I bought a case of these I cant handle 12 strings and the sound of 10 is terrible I prefer 12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands not the fingers but the hand and wrists so 011 strings are what I use I am not sure if they get dirty and get corrosion but they are my main strings and I love the low price too my FAV strings,positive
I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic which I was pretty happy with For my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didnt have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems and I was right I put a pair of DAddario XL 95 highly recommended for those players who cant decide between 9s or 10s and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently Dont let the higher price on these strings entice you go with a good set of DAddario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent longlasting strings Displeased,negative
I cant believe what you can get for the price on this one Tunes all my instruments fast and easy The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever Great tuner,positive
This is a great item because it is small lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere guitar mic stand etc At the same time because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and dont pack it carefully when traveling etc The clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong The clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than 12 sheets of paper on the clip board This doesnt happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig day etc For this price its a good buy in my opinion and with a little care you will get more than your moneys worth out of it Great Item,positive
This case it built really well it has really nice plush interior storage area for picksstringstuning forketc in the neck it DOES have a lock on one of the latches The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key so dont worry Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get itAbove all it fits my Epi LP perfectly as it should hehe Fits well and very durable,positive
It has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all A little goes a long way My guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65 nothing to complain about Works good,positive
You get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your Stratocaster however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard Other than the two missing screws this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your Stratocaster all the screws except for the two pickguard screws by the bridge,positive

All three of my kids have a guitar They were always losing their picks This pick holder is the neatest thing I have seen in a while All of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar I highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks Very handy,positive
These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway I dont notice much difference at all thoughBut the best part is that these strings are over 17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get em for about 948 through Amazons subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping Beat that Best deal going,positive
Ive tried these out in headtohead excuse the pun runs versus Steelseries Plantronics Panasonic and Sony headphones that all cost more and the Tascam TH02 keeps upIm really surprised at how well they perform Lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp Yes the lows could be a bit beefier but out of the headphones I compared it to only the Plantronics excelled in that areaFor fit I have a large noggin like size 7 58 hat And these headphones fit well Not too tight snug but not confining The padding is good and softSeriously Id rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break which they havent and Ive taken them everywhere than spend 100 on another set A Good Value,positive
I have been using the Behringer ACX450 for six months now I was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance It is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects One would have to be filling a large venue to need more than this quality amp can provide Im running preamps from Gibson J45 and a Taylor 114 ce and they both sound amazing and I dont even know what to do with the rest of the gain The music from these instruments is clear bright deep and the sound is a great reproduction of the instruments themselves Behringers mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price I say mission accomplished Amazon was seamless to work with and with free fast shipping the whole experience has been great Man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy Push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep Small amp Small Price Big Sound Great Tone,positive
Bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot Great quality for the money and works well Mic is as described Awesome mic,positive
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home 122311 and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset i would not returned because i dont feel like fighting with no body but they shouldnt do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for hate it,negative
i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me wellI like 11s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the Power Slinky name I can really string along with these,positive
The G7th Performance Capo is by far the nicest capo I have had in 35 years of playing The main obstacle in using in using a capo is it throwing your guitar all out of tune every single time Well the G7th Performance capo is definitely the Worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune It is easy to use And holds all strings down completely and easily The G7th Performance Capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose G7th Performance Capo Six String Silver,positive
Solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise Whoever said Behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear Our radio station owns several pieces along with this unit and are expanding our gear with more purchases of Behringer gear Super value Great little powerhouse,positive
It looks nice its really really long and its made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip After throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener rubbing it with lard dirt and baby powder then soaking it over night Its finally soft and I could play naked without slicing off my head So buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up Wash it rub it lube it wash it soften it,positive
50 years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless mine is unuseable,negative
Excellent rack screws with washers Its fit very good to rack holes Good presentation and well packed I will buy again It fits very good to rack holes,positive
At the time of me writing this review these little guys are hard to find and keep selling out quickly I was lucky enough to get my hands on one early I almost purchased the very nice Ditto Looper when I started looking for a small and simple looper pedal The Ditto is great and should be considered if you are in the market for a tiny looper pedal that does nothing but loop well and at an affordable price That said the Digitech Express XT is a little better Both work well but the Digitech has a few more features in almost as small of a foot print Here are those features The Digitech takes batteries or a power adapter is cheaper than the Ditto has 5 more minutes of looping memory can be daisy chained to other Digitech loopers for multitracking and they synch has LED lights so you know where you are and it has stereo inout None of these are deal breakers alone but together and currently for 30 bucks less the Digitech Express XT is the clear winner IMHO if you can find one to buy Will put the Ditto Looper out of business,positive
Arrived beautifully with plenty of time to forward this on to another guitar enthusiest who rarely changes her strings tune Know strings attached,positive
The product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the Job it was intended for service was more than expected My first Order though Amazon,positive
These are nicely made and the one I bought is working well Im very happy with it and will buy more as I need more Nicely made,positive
I dont have experience with toy instruments but have lots of experience with better quality ones including professional and semi professional ones Im not a ukulele player and this one is for my daughter whose high school ukulele club features players with a variety of instruments for me to compare this one toI found this one to be made well enough that it plays well The frets are properly aligned and the instrument stays in tune Notes played on alternate frets are in tune as well as I would expect relative to each other The tuning issues others have mentioned relative to break in periods are no different from what you would expect on violins or guitars and are perfectly normalAlthough this plays well I was disappointed with the workmanship Since I did not see similar comments from others perhaps mine is not representative But the workmanship is somewhere closer to the level of lower quality instruments Ive seen of other typesThe finishing quality is not out of line for the price range but does not approach what other reviewers have led me to believe The wood is not properly finished where the neck meets the body and there are clear sanding marks in the wrong direction It looks as if it had been finished in a hurry by somebody who had no intention of doing a quality jobA less important issue has to do with the grain Normally instrument makers will try to line up the grain with the direction of the body On mine the grain is at a slant giving the impression that the neck is slightly bent Its an optical illusion but not a sign of higher quality instrument makingThe workmanship issues are cosmetic and Im still quite satisfied with the way the instrument plays The finishing issues will not be visible when being played and the tonal quality is about what Id expect from an instrument with such a small resonating chamber Perhaps there are better sounding soprano models out there but at this price point its what I expect If you are disappointed and want something better expect to pay at least double Nice easy to play instrument,positive
Very nice cable but the white ends which are nice looking could be a little shorter It works awesomely and its not a bad price for name brand cables Good buy,positive
I have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong I use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric Great design I cant see how they could improve this at all Accurate and lasting,positive
I have been in need of a tuner for far too long I was turned on to this and I was truly blown away The tuner is very accurate and compact I leave it on my guitar all the time The clamp is strong enough that it will stay put Works great,positive
I use a late 70s yamaha steel string with this going into an LR Baggs Para DI and it works amazingly well The sound is impeccable But you cant expect to just plug it in and go Youll need a feedback buster and a good preamp But it really does the job good tone Works great in combo with a good preamp,positive
the foam ball prevents wind pop and it also doesnt get smelly like some other foam would be i would highly recommend it very good,positive
In my 13 years of playing the guitar I have settled on D8217Addario as my string of choice When I picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy I8217m really glad I did The tone is great they8217re durable and smooth on the fingers Even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and belllike tone that mandolinists are after They respond great to different styles and dynamic levels You can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock I have a high end Washburn FStyle and these strings coupled with Wegan picks make the Washburn sound SPECTACULAR They also bring out the sound of the wood too which I appreciate If you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good this is the pack to get Thanks D8217Addario for providing an awesome product Just right,positive
I love my Levys Jacquard Straps They are colourful I have purchase 2 to see how they were This one to match with my black Ovation 1861 Balladeer and another to match with my Ovation Maple top CC44 I now have another one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 just ordered this week from AmazonThe straps were chosen to match with the guitar colours and my wife thinks that they are awesome and will certainly be talked about by the ladies around when I play my guitarsThey tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders I have no regrets with the purchases and I truly recommend those straps to anyone Awwesome Guitar Straps,positive
As a guitar player I recently march 2013 started to play the uke I bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument These string play good and stay in tune pretty well I will buy again Great Playability,positive
Installed this on an old Aria dreadnough I found in a dumpsterCleaned it upbuffed the finish outtweaked the truss rod a bit and installed this saddle with new Dunlop 012s and this is one of my prize acoustics nowThanx GraphTech Its GraphTechIts awesome,positive
I dont put these on every guitar but on the right guitar they are perfect Whats the right guitar Longer scales like a strat I would not put these on a shorter scale 22 because it would get too flubby If you hit the power chords hard you may also want to stear clear these require a bit more subtlety in your attack or you will vibrate in and out of tune on the low E when you are pulling off windmills like Townshend They do allow super easy string bends for when I feel lazy or for when my fingers are torn up from playing YMMV Great strings,positive
The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce Crazy Train metal distortion It isnt made to and thus if you buy it for that sound youre off target If thats the sound you want I recommend DigiTech TL2 HardWire Metal Distortion ExtremePerformance Pedal What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price it currently sells for 4995 here at Amazon Unlike so many overdrivedistortion pedals the BAD MONKEY has independent and sensitive dials for treble high and bass low and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound they are by no means token dials In particular the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree especially when using doublecoil pickups its easy to achieve a fat sound with this pedal The pedal does not come with but does accept an external power supply ie an adapter It can also be powered with a 9V battery which is installed under whats literally the pedal portion just as in BOSS pedals The BAD MONKEY is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed It seems extremely rugged again like BOSS pedals I have several overdrivedistortion pedals but I find myself turning to this one again and again My impression of the BAD MONKEY is based on using it with i an Ibanez guitar with good doublecoil pickups ii an Ibanez guitar with good singlecoil pickups similar to soapbar style or P90 pickups and iii a Fender Mustang II amp It works well with both single and doublecoil pickups If I lost my pedal I would order another right away Ive been playing for over 30 years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal Nothing bad about the Bad Monkey,positive
I did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area And look like I make very good choice Im very pleased with this strings,positive
I have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what I want it to It is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet Turn in half way up you get a clean soundcrank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous I own a piece of the legend and music history This Piggy Is Legendary,positive
I purchased these for a Fender Squier Affinity Strat Be aware that they will NOT fit a Squier without drilling some holes The stock tuners have one peg these have two Despite this installing them was quite easy They have a high build quality and work great I was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first but now Im glad I did Great locking tuners,positive
The picks work well with bass but they are just too thick to use with ukulele The pics also shed easily making your instrument dusty in no time Good for bass not for ukulele,negative
ProsI bought this pedal primarily in place of a volume pedal or swell pedal because it does that function fairly well and a lot cheaper Aside from that it also does nearly every other type of delay neededthe tapedigitalanalog switch slightly changes the sound of each delaythe trails feature can be useful for holding a sound in swell mode with high repeats when the pedal is 34off34 and then playing over it with notes or harmonythe time knob acts like an analog knob pitch shifting when turned after playing a notethe repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation sometimes runaway depending on the delay typethe mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signalstereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itWhile the pedal has small problems it compensates by inexpensive fixesConsThe modulation is a kind of adjustable widthdepth all in one knob and isnt the best compared to a chorus pedal Just a general warbleThe blue led is VERY bright to the point where you cant see the settings on the knobs so I cover it with a sticker it still shows through enough hahaThe casing is plastic but it is thick and durable enough maybe not for consistent giggingbeing a digital effect the footswitch is not state dependent in other words if you turn off the pedal unplug it and plug it back in the pedal will turn onbecause it is buffered bypass the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it even when offthe battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch and then lift upthere is no noticeable 34click34 when you change delay type however the led flashesOther notesalmost half the weight of the pedal is the bottom metal plate The pedal without it feels shockingly lightweight but with it has a good amount of heft Good deal Good pedal Comprehensive review,positive
This has been a very good purchase I have not stopped using it since I got it good and prompt service as well Thanks again Cheers Great Product,positive
If you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick For a Beatles collector what a great price for a neat Beatles product Even the packaging it coolIf you need picks for playing or a neat Beatles product to collect you wont be dissipointed with this purchaseExcellent product from a fantastic seller Good product for guitar player or collector,positive
Its made from China but very please for me sound so warm and vibration much better than famous brand Will buy again with other size Which 6 stars Yes I love it and U will love it too,positive
30 bucks is better than 179 for the tube screamer from Ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube I use this on the clean channel of my Bugera V22 tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should Awesome with my LTD VC401 with 59 and JB pickups Awesome price and deal,positive
Removes grime and such Makes surfaces very smoothI dont know how it works individually I used it with Gerlitz cleaning spray It works well with cleaning spray Great,positive
I bought the Hell babe 10 years ago it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since the same one i have never had a major problem with it the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal Its no crybaby and im glad it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldnt no matter how much i tweaked it I actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more especially since it has the auto off and spring back it really makes my solos rip buy it you will have a ball My only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever My Secret Weapon,positive
It works well hasnt broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned Now if only all windscreens were this sturdy Id be a happy customer Its Simple and Great,positive
I received my tuner yesterday very fast shippingit looks great the price is right but most of all it works wonderful very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case Wonderful little Beauty,positive
Fun little rig Needed something to play electric through headphones and this offered me that plus a mini amp when needed The sound quality is surprisingly hot Pocket Amps rock,positive
Great just as expected Thank to all Five Stars,positive
I wanted a noise reducer because I have like 10 pedals and the loud feedback I was getting back through them was insane I got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not Its like 25 It was a great choice The pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesnt alter your tone It does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden Its great Does it job well,positive
Very good tuner and I love that it attached to the instrument and you can leave it there I wholeheartedly endorse the product I own two,positive
This 6Pack of Guitar Patch Cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable spaghetti mess These are well made cables with 90degree connectors which is exactly what we neededHighly RecommendedCFH Good Patch Cables Highly Recommended,positive
nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy peppy perky free i do i do i do good,positive
My new guitar had only the back strap connectorYou can put out over 20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks I decided on thisAttach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar headYou now have a quick release strap holderVery well made strongHappy I found this before spending way more than I needed toHighly recommend this productJoe Exactly what I needed,positive
Ive been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars It has multiple usesCleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands extending the life and tone of your stringsLubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or soWorks decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints etc from the top sides and back will not harm most finishes as far as I knowI usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as wellI did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference Im not sure if this is true as Ive never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers However I typically try to keep it off of electronic components in general just out of common senseFor under ten bucks the can will last you awhile Just order a few at a time and find free shipping youll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time Keeps Your Strings Clean And Fresh,positive
I gave these strings a try but I dont care for them that much I have always used SPs or Elixirs and I dont think that will change after trying these Not for me,neutral
Still glad I have it Would prefer to exchange a slightly larger package for full size keys and the action is a little weak less than synth actionbut it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultraportable Almost,positive
Great little amp I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker Little Giant,positive
Other reviewers have mentioned that the slot that goes over the strap peg is tight They are correct but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle For the bread this is a great strap Buy one and see what I mean My uncle played with a couple of old boot laces for a strap back in the day Treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot Good little strap,positive
Im using four of these for Podcasting they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used I am completely happy Perfect,positive
this makes winding strings MUCH faster but it does feel flimsy and the end piece doesnt fit over my tuing pegs correctly so its a bit of a haslle getting started Other than that its great for the price but not a must have its OK,neutral
Not the best but not the worse This stand works as expected it can hold a guitar All the surfaces that make contact with your instrument are covered with rubber padding which is important Only downside is theres no neck support I used this mainly for putting my guitar down when not playing not for displaying Stand,positive
Sound quality is great I also have the very first JamMan with the add on 3 button footswitch I wanted a smaller footprint so I purchased this Dont expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though In a band setting your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record stop and playback Slightly more difficult than the BIG JamMan Looper but very usable This blows away the Ditto pedal by another manufacturerI had that one first and it is horrible to usesold itI am happy with it and use it live in a 3 and 4 piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when I am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages Excellent quality It has a lot of great syncing features but I do not use those Find a youtube video to see all of its potential Best looper for the money JamMan Express XT,positive
Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar and while the back support wouldnt scratch a guitar anyway its nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture mainly because the guitar sits very low This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands but overall this is excellent Ive replaced all my stands with these Great guitar stand,positive
I installed this saddle in my Silvertone SD10 If you have a lower end guitar this will make a huge difference I had to sand it down some in all directions I did the length first then thickness and finally the height I used 220 grit sandpaper The directions are in the package Great Guitar Saddle,positive
These strings are the best Havent found any others that sound and feel so good They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours Go figure I actually thought I didnt need to change strings still dont know for sure because they still sounded so good and show no wear Anyway I decided to change the strings because its been so long Happy that I did however Happy again,positive
The cloth that comes with the product is a high quality polishing cloth but some idiot thought it was best to package it stuck to the bottle with a glue button that leaves glue stuck to the cloth This glue is only removable after a expensive bath using Goo Gone or similar glue dissolving solution then washing with warm soapy water by hand and rinsing thoroughly in clear clean running water until all soap is removed then hanging the cloth up to air dry preferably outdoors in the sunshine if you have that available The cloth is so nice it is worth the timeconsuming and correct method of cleaning but is not why you buy a product that is supposed to clean and polish in the first place Somebody better redesign the packaging for this product as the Gibson cleaner polish is firstrate and puts a high lustrous shine on the guitar surface which comes out bright dry and hard almost like having used a high quality paste wax but without residue Very good stuff very irresponsible packaging for the convenience of the factory I assume but without forethought to the customers needs The polish is great the packaging sucks,positive
Designed to accommodate most standard shaped guitar picks this Dunlop pick holder is handy little spring loaded device for storing picks You can mix brands and types but how many picks can fit inside will vary from around three to perhaps a dozen As a guide about 10 Dunlop 060mm nylon picks will fit but only 4 Dunlop 150mm Delrin picks Even thick irregular picks like the Dunlop 30 Big Stubby will fit however the total number will be greatly reducedBuild quality is good but forcing too many picks inside could cause the spring to fail or the seam to split A piece of double stick tape shaped to match the pick holder is included The tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place I stuck mine on the backside of the headstock of my guitar and while it stays in place its pretty wobblyColor options at this time seem to be limited to black but if you have DIY skills you could paint it whatever color you like This is a decent buy below the two dollar level I prefer this model over theDunlop 5505 pick holder because it seems to be sturdier and I like the more rounded appearance convenient pick storage,positive
this is the most ergonomic tuner there is it functions well it is sturdy and it fits in ur pocket count on fender to give u a good product Well tuned,positive
I searched on Amazon for a banjo strap and this came up When I received the strap I realized it doesnt fit a banjo I then looked at the description closely and found it says its a guitar strap Just to let you know this is not a banjo strap I was able use it anyway on my guitar Its not the best strap in the world but its not bad I gave it four stars for that reason I think it would wear quickly with lots of use its not a banjo strap,positive
I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably In fact they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman Dawgs The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone I would recommend these to anyone Much better than average,positive
There are a TON of reviews here and I dont have a lot to add You can read about what this tuner does and does not do in the specs section or from other reviewers who tend to review specs instead of how they like or dislike something Bottom line this is my favorite headstock tuner I also own the new NS mini and it has its own qualities that I like as well like being small but it doesnt fit on my Godins headstock This tuner the SNARK fits on my Godins small headstock with no problems On a dark stage this works great I love this little tuner five stars great little tuner,positive
Though Id warn if you dont know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically deesse the whole thing but between the pop filter and a slightly offcenter placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and essess from making an appearance in any way Does what it says,positive
just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidlyi never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree D know what your getting,positive
Ive been using Dunlaps Tortex picks now for going on 10 years and recently just switched over to heavy Jazz picks smaller sharper tip These picks work great They provide enough surface area that they wont slip easily from between your fingers They allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them Any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use I also prefer the high thickness so theres no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure youre putting on the strings Great picks love the turtles,positive
I have tried several different kinds of guitar tuners and of the ones I have tried the Snark is the best It is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier I highly recommend this tuner Excellent guitar tuners,positive
This is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should Theres nothing else to say but to get it if you need it The quality doesnt suck so dont worry about Peace out perfect cloth,positive
It is a decent cable It does its job but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned The mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth The switch is also loose The connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressedI would not recommend using this cable for critical applications It would be more suited to home or hobby use Does Its Job,neutral
I really like this little tuner is is maintenance free small light and easy to use Highly recommended for the price Great little gadget,positive
Got to admit I was a little intimidated by the installation process when I was shopping for this pickup But when I got the box I was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions not too long not too short along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly The jig method is super easy and provided great results I was really excited to try out the pickup so I plugged it into my Roland AC33 and let her rip it was awsome very full and very representative of my guitars sound KK you have a convert in me I am now thinking about trying this on my Martin Best installation instructions I have seen from any company,positive
I am a tech as well as a guitar player I also have spent time in the past Teaching soldering But these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections Most of us know by now that theres a lot of hype but it really comes down to Good Quality Cable This Seems to be Good Stable Connectors These seem to be the connections between the two that last Time will tell All I know is I have Hand Soldered Special plugs with Good Cable to only have them break with use and I expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged unplugged often I do know these are signal clean do Not bleed f highs that is critical in my book They are Very Easy to use can be done on Stage between or before sets very quickly and with NO Soldering I Love thatI will definitely use these again unless I find a longevity problemLM Great Option,positive
I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently The price is right for these and they work just fine My only real issue is that sometimes they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret youre going to bar thus producing a sound you werent looking for Some of the higher end capos counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring However like i say these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard and are from what i can tell the most popular model on the market They work pretty well,positive
This is a nice leather strap not thick but very functional and nice looking I found it a bit uncomfortable with a heavyweight electric guitar but should work just fine with an acoustic Great Strap for Acoustic Guitars,positive
I almost always play finger style without a pick but on the occasion I need a pick I like theseEasier to strum sounds good to meIf youre doing a lot of picking out individual strings youll probably want something thicker but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good plus pick out a few strings here and there Broken a few but theyre cheap and I still prefer them,positive
Works well Very well constructed Would it kill ya to add an onoff switch so that the batteries dont run down Other than that its perfect Boss FS6 Foot Switch,positive

I was using the standard version of these I saw these at Amazon and figured Id give them a tryThese cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables I was using however the ends seem much more well beltDoesnt make a difference in the sound I dont know but I am satisfied with this purchase Great heavyduty cables,positive
I purchased this before I have ever changed a string While waiting for it to come I had to change one Youtube videoed how to do it This tool came and while it is nice and I will be sure to use it It is not a MUST have But I had wire snips from my jewelry kit available Not everyone would have those This will work great It is sturdy and small Good to own but not a must,positive
I bought this cable for my bands live show setup I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application While not the best quality cable the length and price make it a good value for the money especially if youre buying several at a time I dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine Id recommend this cable if youre on a budget and looking to buy several at a time If youre only going to buy one Id look into Canare or Mogami theyre a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price Good value not the best quality,positive
Put this on my cheap acoustic guitar and it looks so good I might have to upgrade my guitar Not much else to say about it It adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do looks really nice,positive
The TASCAM TH2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears They are great Excellent bass response not muddy at all tight mids and clear highs To boot they are extremely comfortable as well The foam fits nicely around your ears conforming to the contours of your face They are adjustable so if you have a huge head you can still wear these The only drawback that I can see and I dont really even consider this a negative is the coiled cord Some people may not like that All in all these are great headphones I have listened to all varieties of music with them monitored recordings with them etc excellent By the way they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background making the music come out clearer Kudos to Tascam for making such good headphonesMay 12 2014 UPDATE These headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly I have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working What a disappointment excellent music reproduction until they quit,negative
Put these on my GL S500 electric Sound great play great keeping their tune None broken yet but I dont usually break strings I play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs Blues blues slide rock metalI use DAddario strings a lot I try others but always come back to them These will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on I really like them Hammer Bend Thrash It,positive
This device has so many uses whether it comes to mixing audio for a presentation a gaming video or playing musical instruments There are so many controls and this mixer has just enough inputsoutputscontrols for just about anything that Ive been using it for It seems to be very durable as well It does seem to get hot after a while but that hasnt affected its use at all and so far hasnt damaged the device in any way Behringer is the way to go Works great A wonderful tool to have,positive
This pedal sounds great with my fender excelsior with its 15 inch speaker and also very good with my 1960s danelectro tweed amp with its bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker I can use the entire range of the tone knob to go from aggressive growls at the low end to screaming lead tones at the other end and it never sounds harsh The clipping is sweet and musical with a sound very reminiscent to cranked amplifier stacks with their front ends being pushed with overdrive pedals Sometimes I feed this with my SD1 or my Danelectro D2 overdrive and it just puts it over the top FOR THE PRICE these pedals are outstanding The QC may not be perfect and there are duds out there but I would say that it is worth the risk as the circuits in these are just like vintage pedals although they do use cheaper components and boards and such As long as you dont literally stomp down on the pedal and you dont drop it down the stairs it will last long enough to make it worth your while Also the blue LED is somewhat bright and annoying but it is a good indicator so I guess it does its job Overall rock on Great tone and not harsh at all,positive
The Cable is good and normal good price and works well The rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and I have to push them in place all too often The cable works,neutral
martins are no doubt excellent strings The light strings carry excellent deep tone and are not to hard on my fingers Good deep acoustic tone,positive
Durable affordable easy to grasp and use easy to grasp and use,positive
This does what it says it does Anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole This is easy to install I just losened the strings and inserted the o port My Washburn D30S will never leave home without one Adds clarity and lowers feedback,positive
The Behringer US600 is wellmade The high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused It is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass modeI purchased the US600 specifically for the 34Detune34 effect This effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps The effect is particularly dramatic when Outputs A B are fed into two different amps giving a nice roomfilling stereo effectI was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects The Pitch Shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect about as good as I have heard anywhere When using both outputs it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp This makes the guitar sound HUGEThe Harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses It wont make you sound like Duane Allman and Dickey Betts playing in harmony However it is handy for short solos I tried it in the key of G and got useful resultsThe Trem Bar would work well in loud uses like metal The Flutter effect gives a nice Leslie effect soundOverall I think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals I have seen several speak ill of it but Im not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal There is quite a learning curve on this gadget but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the deviceOne other observation This is more of a studio effect than a road effect There are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect It would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor I had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments The only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect Detune for example while giggingIn conclusion I debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect Im glad I finally decided to get it The great sounding Detune effect alone makes it worth the price The Octave effect from the Pitch Shifter is a nice bonus The other effects are icing on the cake Kudos to Behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior Good Value,positive
these do a good job of isolating out the sound They work very well Would recommend it to other people like them,positive
I works as advertised What can I say Its inexpensive and does what its supposed to Just buy it and move on It is what it is,positive
This isnt the best strap but its affordable and pretty good for a beginners guitar strap The pick holder on the strap is pretty neat however I dont find myself using it often The guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job Recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar Dont forget to buy strap locks you will need it affordable,neutral
Ive owned a Seymour Duncan Woody for several months now and have had a chance to try it out with various amps with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end and so on This is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as youre likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup The one thing Ive found is that I get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the Woody through my Ampeg bass amp than through my Peavey guitar amp The high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and theres a tendency for distortion to creep in even with the clean setting Through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear The pickup is easy enough to install and remove and its easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesnt interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would The other great feature of this pickup is the look the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar If you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup this is the one to buy Excellent Value Look and Sound,positive
Phantom power supplies arent very sexy items but theyre extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones This Nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm Totally nofrills rock solid metal construction and you cant hear it at all Works as advertised,positive
I compared this to a C1 which is pretty good for half the price I also tried two MXLs One V63 This is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much I noticed the difference on guitar On vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you But I realized that its normal and the other mike just didnt pick stuff up which is worse The MXL v67g sounded warm on vocals and not too bad on guitar but if you got too close it gave you this fake low voice and thats just like taking the AT2035 signal and modifying it after youve recorded it Besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me I tried the CAD M179 That did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids I heard the AT2020 wasnt as good as the AT2035 so I went for it And its more than the switches difference which I dont use anyway I didnt like the switches on the CAD M179 either Its confusing and I do gain or filter in my DAW I considered the NT1 but at 80 bucks more than the 2035 it seemed like they were very similar At the end Im satisfied with the 2035 Its a work horse and costs a fraction of the more popular studio amps that have only a subtle difference to me I have been staying away from AT products because I didnt like the headphones compared to Sonys But this time I caved in because I dont see anything that competes at my price range For me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same I can record my acoustic or electric guitar out of the cab or sing in it My challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room Ive removed the door on my closet put a shower curtain with a down comforter on it and record in there Ridiculous setup but Ive save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that For most vocals recording I dont use the closet Just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise So if things dont change this is my choice for best vocal and instrument microphone in the 100250 price range Nice solid construction and vibration mount included Its rugged and I like it I tried several microphones,positive
good deal Four Stars,positive
In my opinion this thing is well worth the price Gives great overdriven tube amp sound versatile for 95 of music not for bonecrushing metal The knobs work fine but do not seem to rolloff or not very sensitive precise full range achieved from 6 to noon Nice tube overdriven sound for incredible price,positive
This is a handy little contraption Im using on one of my cheaper guitars It wasnt compatible with the other strap Ive been using and I had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap but it worked well with the strap on my other guitarI think its a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly Good design,positive
I bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner These are the best tuners for the money The display is very stable and its simply fun and easy to use Great Tuner,positive
I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over Small and sturdy I use it at practice and during our live shows You cant go wrong with this This is the perfect stand,positive
This one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features The analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal All about range,positive
When this arrived I didnt realize it was that small Thought it has to be so its out of the way Then I thought this thing cant work very well but it does perfectly The first few times a used it I wasnt expecting muchhowever I couldnt more wrong it really works well and I would recommend this to family or friends Works better than I expected,positive
The Rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone Id consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 14 The real treat is the Tone switch Its almost like having two stompboxes in one The footswitch action is smooth quiet and nearly effortless The effect is there then its not There are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out Its hard to beat this box at any price If the unthinkable happened Id buy another one in a heartbeat Delicious,positive
My preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it but it wasnt adjustable I bought this one for its adjustability Good strap and inexpensive,positive
Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging GOOD WINDSCREEN FOR THE MONEY,positive
Do not let the size fool you This is a very handy piece of equipment and its so easy to set up and use Just plug a 14 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the HA400 then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs This is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and its built like a tank Be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system you can only adjust volume from the HA400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 14 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals An inexpensive solution to a common problem,positive
I thought it would be resin or plasticNot so It was made heavier and nicerThe metal musthave will be in the family a while I can tell Metal Tough Reliable,positive
Put my Schecter C1 Custom FR in Drop Bb these strings sound great and have a great low end Highly reccomend Great for Drop Bb,positive
This is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home Its a great little unit The only set back is that you can not use Condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is NO phantom power on this unit You need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular XLR or HiZ microphones Great little mixer,positive
remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery storeSticky Hands 12 per unitThese are kinda like that but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1 x 2you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed They even work on cymbals if youre looking for a quicker decayThe closer to the center or more pads you use the more dramatic the effect You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry themIve been using them for years and they work amazingly Awesome stuff,positive
I got these for my dad for Christmas He loved them all and wont quit playing with them I figured he would put them into his collection of cool things hes amassed but he uses them daily to play the Ibanez acousticelectric I got him Great for those Beatles fans in your life,positive
Ernie Ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician communityThese strings are affordable and last a VERY long time on someones guitar during normal useYou will not be disappointed in this productThey sound VERY clean and bright and if you use a product like GHS Fast Fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longerThey do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly Good Quality Strings,positive
Since this my first Snark SN1 Tuner I am very pleased with performance it gives me accurate read outs against built in tuners on the guitars Acoustic that is Like all all functions it has looking forward to maybe upgrading to the next model or so just have a few around for each instrument Snark SN1 Tuner,positive
I like how with this pedal not only does it not have a heavy click when you press down but if you are playing in a dark room the LED lights are nice and bright True Bypass Im telling you get it One of the best,positive
Tortex picks are the best Pitch black is so cool 10 mm is the perfect thickness Dont buy those other picks buy these because Tortex Black 10 mm is the perfect combination Great Picks,positive
elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic they last forever and dont rust they sound awesome get them the best guitar strings,positive
Best strings for my ukulele These are great quality I only use Aquila strings on my instruments Highly recommended My ukulele has a better tone with these strings Best,positive
I got this for my Epi Sheraton IIPROS It fits perfectly its fur lined and has a decent sized internal compartment its solid and the hardware is sturdy it has one locking latch out of five but nothing that would stop a real thief it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground its relatively thinCONS Its heavy the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle it has some Made in China characteristicsIve had several cases and this is one of the nicest On a personal level Id prefer it didnt say Epiphone on the outside But since it does its a good place to hide a 3000 Gibson 335 Fits like a glove,positive
I use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals Ive knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged I couldnt be happier with it The standard,positive
These picks were a filler item for a much larger order I can always use guitar picks however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel Purchase comment,positive
I returned the SKB PS45 and got the PT2 as a replacement The SKB is a well built board but the Pedaltrain boards are simply the best functional design available period And designing them with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power in mind is stroke of genius Providing the brackets to mountanother brilliant stroke This is a nobrainer This is your best option for a top flight pedalboard Great job Great Design,positive
This is for the price I paid for it here on Amazon far less than what it is currently selling for a very good buy At the current price of almost 30 bucks I would pass or look at other options but that is just me The leather is attractive thick enough soft enough for the price and I found the length to be more than long enough for me personally I almost have it on the shortest possible setting and there is far more room to let out Only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps I only have a few very MINOR complaints and of course my complaints are subjective so YMMV One the back side of the strap is not black Its a bluegrey color and I didnt realize that You can see a tiny bit of the greyish color in the photo but not enough to really get an idea of what the backside looks like I assumed incorrectly that both sides were black Two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes All that said it is nice and some will love it Quality at the right price Easy to adjust Looks like it will last Solid four stars despite me personal opinion Nice quality,positive
I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret Junk,negative
Excellent compact guitar stand Folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag Not as stable as some stands but for the size and price cant be beat Thanks to Amazon for offering such a good product Fender Mini Electric Guitar Stand,positive
Brough this for trying electric feels on the acoustic guitar and dont want to waste too much money on electric acoustic preamp guitar or big amp if I dont like the eFeels After researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it I decided to give it a try I didnt expect too much on 20 amp but surprisingly it positively gives me more than I ask for I also brough it with the adaptor which is great to save for long runs and I dont have to worry about the battery for home practices It is adorable out of the box it looks like a lovely toy but it works professionally based on its 10w amp I dont care much about the manufactors suggested modes basically I just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds I like in different songs on guitar uke I like the small size that wont take too much space on my tiny room its cute to look at and it is practical tooI had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup however when I changed to another one I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup I almost thought that was an issue from the amp luckily I have two different pickups to try it deeply After using the better pickup the amp doesnt have any issue yet I have used for few times so I dont know about its longevity yetOne more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitars sound itself wont be muted but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp anyway its a great feature to have Cute Great Quality for Mini AMP,positive
The pedal itself works perfectly fine Using it as a foot pedal controller on my Korg Triton LEIT SQUEAKS Needs some WD40 Works greatbut squeaky,positive
The screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar and you would think they would want to standardize so they didnt have to carry so many parts Nope doesnt fit a Squire Affinity just FYI FenderSquire should standardize their drillings,neutral
I got this guitar at Guitar Center i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy so i wanted to see it in person i saw it i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing its better than my other les paul special ii this guitar plays great its set up very nicely the pickups are very nice the electronics work perfectly i have no problems with it but the guitar is very beautiful i would highly recommend getting it i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same not all guitars are made the same right Just Amazing,positive
Like the previous reviewer I bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp and it just did wonders to warm the sound Only problem is now I am eyeing my amp all its tubes and thinking if one little adjustment made such a difference in a preamp imagine what some of these will do in my fender Sigh Always somethingAnyway this is great I am sure I will get more Yup,positive
It fits nice an tight on mic stand you can get around ten picks in it so its a good product Nice,positive
well I found the lesson very good and worth the money I payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great great learning lesson poor instrument,neutral
These were purchased for my parts bin They fit they work they are quiet and they wont make your life miserable Thats all I want from replacment parts They work What else can you ask for,positive
Good quality wired correctly cant complain If you use the One Spot power adaptor you need to have a couple of these laying around Its probably not practical but I wish they made more sizes In one configuration I only need two plugs in another configuration I need three and yet another configuration I need five so I actually bought a few of the fives and cut them off to the length I need Just part of my One Spot arsenal,positive
What you see is what you get Its cheap Its basic and It works The best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options Call me the guitar man,positive
I am disabled a disabled Vietnam Vet and my mobility is becoming more limited every winter My wife bought me this for Christmas thinking I needed a new hobby to keep me busy during the harsh winter monthsI am so happy she did My first thought was Now I have to learn how to play this thing I am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with I now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars I always get carried away with new projects and can already play quite well or so Im told I practice a lotNow about the guitar I wanted to wait until I knew a little something before I reviewed it First I dont know how they sell these for the price they do It is a very high quality piece comparable to guitars in the thousand dollar price rangeThe action is nice and low good especially for a beginner I did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference I use light DAddaro strings and love the tone and feelThe Yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as youd expect for this price The tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough It sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it I have been strumming vigorously for over four months now and not a mark is on the guitar I have been playing many other guitars all electric as well and am looking at a high end acoustic now but will always keep my first There is no reason for me to need another acoustic I just will because I canThis Yamaha has great tuners and stays in tune well rarely having to make an adjustment once the strings are stretchedThe neck is nice though a bit thick so I cheat sometimes with my thumb on the low E The setup was perfect with this and I just cant see where its going to take much if any maintenance over the years other than replacing strings as neededThe Yamaha came with a great hard case tuner pics and other goodies as a package and was very inexpensive I did put a nice soft leather strap with a quick disconnect on it as there is no front strap button but no big deal thereIf youre looking for a nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing this would be a great place to start I see these selling used for what I paid for mine new so youre bot going to lose money on it either Read the other reviews this is a really nice value It is still my only acoustic that I own my other 25 guitars are all electrics or project guitars I do have my eye on a Martin though5 PLUS stars for this one If youre considering it buy it You will not regret it I still play this on almost every day My first guitar and a great one to start with,positive
I received this yesterday in my order It fits on my guitar fine but I cant seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap The button is so rounded and smooth that my guitar strap just wont go over the top of the button Not sure what to do now Unique idea,positive
I have been using an old elasticbar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension When I first applied the Planet Waves TriAction Capo I thought here we go again There was ample tension EG but B and E were buzzy as all get out Not expecting much I adjusted the tension It took a couple of tries to get it just right but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar zero buzz across the board That in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze on and off it looks nice I have the black version as well as its comparative ease on the wallet and this capo is a rock solid five star productThis capo also has a pick holder The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capos overall size and shape but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itselfGet this capo No buzz,positive
While I havent used a lot of capos in my playing I have used 4 or 5 different types and this is easily the best of that batchWhile all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar this one was pretty easy to dial in I had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuningThe action of the grip and release mechanism is easy but it delivers firm pressure to the strings In fact the only negative I found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chordsOverall this is a very good capo and I can recommend it without hesitation best Ive used,positive
It arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it the base the bottom fork and the top fork and it didnt take much assembly to put it together It does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well I will probably buy a couple more of theseThe only downside I can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin I hope this doesnt eventually have a hole wear through it but over time I could see it happening I suppose by that time I could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though It took just a moment to set up,positive
This is a very wellbuilt stand Looks good too It does its job well and you can definitely be sure that it will last quite long Highly recommended Cheers Great stand,positive

If you are have problems knowing what and where your systems are terminating theses are a must for you I have mastched them with my microphones and it is easy for controlling and identifying alway in control with colors,positive
I guess I did not expect much since it was so cheap Just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this I got it for my son and he wasnt impressed Does not have good sound but heyif youre just wanting a toy go for it Definitely economy,neutral
I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold This one sticks well to the guitar Locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it I might try it somewhere on the strap Good to have,positive
What can I say It does what it should 5 pedals on a chain runs safely without crazy hiss and hum on my rig Of course if youre running a chain of drivedistortion pedals youre asking for itWorks great for me Zero complaints Strong cable Zero complaints,positive
This is my thrid Levys strap and it is as good as the rest of them that I have had for a few years I have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others I have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but I dont see a problem with it so far and I use it regularly I have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer but it is a standard sizeI prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in Canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials For the price the strap works well and I would buy more Levys straps if needed Great Levys strap for the price,positive
The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker Ive ever heard PeriodThis does not mean that its dull sounding or muffled at least not if you hearing is still good I hesitated quite a bit before I decided to buy it and install it in my Fender Mustang II but my worries were for naught Incredibly it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds Yet for overdrive sounds there is very little fuzziness just a big full and FAT sound thats articulate without being buzzy If you play metal youll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy classic rock and jazzy sounds this is a speaker to seriously consider I turned my Mustang II into an open back combo and the Cannabis Rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed I had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps it never got shrill or piercing just buttery smooth and clear Its also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db1W1MI dont know how Eminence did it but I love it Truly a SMOKIN speaker,positive
The pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me How the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable Anyway the pickup sounds very nice and im happy Very nice pickup but,positive
For your money I cant recommend the EQ enough Its cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard Fish Chips,positive
This product is straight forward and works as its intendedOne side note there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings Im not sure if all of them do this but the one I received does It doesnt cause any problem with the products performance its just loud Works great a little squeaky,positive
Well built and solid stand It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too Some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars which should last a long time It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars Highly recommend it Solid guitar stand,positive
Very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive soundVery high gainfits in all size soundholesGood heavy constructionOf course its not greatIm not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myselfIf you have a Taylor Martin or Gibson thats not already AE this is not for you I probably didnt even need to say thatI just have a cheep Rogue that sounds good with this pickupIts just a matter of how much you want to or can spendIm happy with this pickupJoe Nice Price Nice Sound,positive
This is a little more expensive than some other brands but i think it sounds great and its way more durable than a plastic pedalIm pretty new to electric guitar so im not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers To me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp so I think its a good purchase Nice pedal,positive
I use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar It is accurate and easy to use Works great,positive
I got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me That is a record The tones are warm and welcoming not as sharp as with other strings It is the sound that I like though Havent broken yet,positive
Pop filter works great This really eliminated many subtle flaws I had with audio recording Granted you can make a makeshift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon But the adjustable clamp is reallywell adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations Plus although it is flexible it is also very sturdy so dont worry about and vibration noises coming from this Works great,positive
this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough i like it with the power supplyno batteries to fuss with nice sound thicksweet gooey goodness,positive
This metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it It is so durable filled with options Very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician durable,positive

Okay well I lied in subject line bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand I can say that with authority since I run KJ shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20 years so I know good singers when I hear them And they will ask if I have a shure SM58 to which i reply Hell No you think Im going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk The more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe Some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic Id rather lose one of these Behringers than a 58 Or a wireless 58 Sound wise these are great for their intended purpose If you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain Great for Karaoke makes bad singers sound better,positive
Love the holder and the picks looke great and nice and I dont have to look around for my picks when Im ready to play my guitar love it,positive
Im not a ukulele player nor do I pretend to be one but I am guy that likes to make music and I can happily say that the Mahalo U30GN is a perfect addition to my instrument collection Worth noting is that you will need to tune the ukulele each time you play for the first few weeks until the strings are 34broken in34 but from what Ive read and gathered this is par for the course Lastly if youre going to order one I suggest pairing it with a pack of felt picks Cheers Aloha,positive
It is what it is Works Works as expected and should last a really really long time Glad I bought it Nice gig list backer,positive
I am a converted guitar player and I like playing with a pick I like that sharp thwack sound But the tone can be a little harsh so I got these They are much quieter than a hard pick but the tone is not the same as bare fingers For me they were a waste of money Nothing special,neutral
Ive never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few Out of most Ive tried Ive come across the Big Muff the most It didnt really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently Even my Boss Hyper Metal HM3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks but it isnt 100 there certainlyMy budget being what is it right now I didnt want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal There are loads of fuzzes available for 100 or less but this model is essentially three pedals in one Thats what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in YouTube Not to mention the bargain basement priceThe three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal The two fuzz modes in my view dont perfectly emulate any one pedal but are extremely useful nonethelessFUZZ 1 is a creamy midrange filled sound It doesnt get too bright until the TREBLE knob is pushed past 3 o clock This fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick With humbuckers its actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o clock I love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay It seems to work best with power chords root5th note and single notes If you play complex chords youll hardly notice them if you try to play them use as little gain as possibleFUZZ 2 is more in line with the Big Muff It has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister With the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here This fuzz also has more sustain than FUZZ 1 so it buzzes longer This makes it great to use alongside a guitarist thats using a looser sounding high gain tone that isnt necessarily fuzzy Head era KoRn comes to mind for meThe third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile BOOST This mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level It actually distorts a little but thats only after cranking the EQ and GAIN knobs all the way up The resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven nonmaster volume amp or a master volumes clean channel fully cranked Still throughout most of its gain and volume range BOOST does a good job of staying clean This would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound It might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effectsOverall I like the tones this pedal spits out Ive only had it a few hours but I love what Im hearing so far The build is similar to the other Behringer pedals I have a NR100 noise reducer and a TO800 their overdrive that sounds like a Tube Screamer With this more recent pedal built on June of 2010 the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before Id still not abuse them too much though As always really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tankYou cant go wrong with the bright blue LED either Makes it easy to see on a dark stage along with the dayglo orange pedal color Totally fuzzed,positive
A perfect sounding string The crisp ring these strings give is undeniable they are the best you can get Your uke is going to come with crappy strings change them to Aquilas Aquila Soprano Ukulele Strings,positive
Not much to say here Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year The strings are great priced great and was on sale which made it even better There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so thats good too Great Strings for Great Price,positive

I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP10 that came with my guitar The Squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button I couldnt afford a bunch of pedals but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try It is Awesome For such a small amp the output is plenty loud for practicing at home and it runs on batteries too so I can take it anywhere The effects are better than Id hoped for This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer but for an intermediate level guitarist like me who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family this is the amp to get It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus flanger phaser or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay Im one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time I dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like I love this amp Awesome Effects and a Great Sound,positive
This is an excellentsounding pickup Ive had it for about six years Good sound throughout the spectrum full lows and bright highs without too much emphasis on either At the price it sells for I consider it a bargainThe drawbacks1 You need to be pay attention when installing and removing you can damage the sound hole on your guitar if youre not careful2 No volume controlIf youre looking to occasionally amplify an acoustic guitar this is a great costeffective way to go Great sound regardless of price,positive
I use this pedal in tandem with my APC40 and map the buttons to various controls in Ableton The foot switch opens the door to more organic sound live performances with a prepared track The polarity switches are nice however the momentarylatch switches are what makes this unit so compatible with my DAW Some functions such as play and stop are momentary functions other functions such as track onoff are togglelatch functions Without a foot switch that can toggle between the two applications are limited certain functions I use the footswitch for a variety of applications in a variety of songs with different arrangements If I could hook up more than one of these to my controller Id have about four of them but the one is so nice on its own Ableton live application,positive
This product is worth having if like me you find yourself needing a place to quickly park your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand Works great only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside or a way of semipermanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesnt move around I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed Overall I like it worthwhile,positive

The DAddario EXL110BT Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings Balanced Tension Regular Light are great Ive been a long time fan of DAddario strings and these strings did not disappointThey were very easy to string my Fender Strat with and stayed in tune a good long time The strings had a good feel to them as wellWhere I noticed the Balanced Tension the most was when I played chords You know how you have tuned your guitar and its tuned as well as its going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesnt sound right You check the tuning and its tuned alright but why isnt it sounding rightThese strings gave a clear clean sound when I strummed those chords Bar Chords were terrific too ImpressiveI think I have some new favorite strings for my Strat Very Nice Strings,positive
Im using these cables to string effects pedals together Ive had no issues with them so far They seem sturdy enough for rough handling and Im not noticing any extra noise Quality cables reasonable price,positive
This thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the topI had a LPB1 that sucked tone and sounded like crap but I really need a line boost and didnt want to spend a lot for oneThis little baby at about 3 oclock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs Nice amp boost pedal,positive

A good piece of kit Except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs Its also squeakily noisy when string winding The cutter works perfectly Good all rounder,neutral
I was disturbed with the price of banjos until I did some research on the construction of them Theyre not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience At least they wouldnt be able to put together a quality banjo But Jameson Guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair priceThe tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great Im a guitar player and Im excited to explore the different sounds I will be able to get out of this banjo Its also very good looking I love the neck and the back Even the drum Quality work was put into this thing Im quite pleasedNow I just need to get used to playing with 5 strings Fantastic Quality,positive
I realized I didnt have any distortion pedals only a bunch of overdrive pedals so I set out to find a distortion pedal After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey Since I dont want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great albeit quite bright The only thing I dont like about this pedal is the brightness which can be tamed with the tone knob otherwise it is easy to use sounds really good and is transparent Transparent in that it doesnt add a lot of color to your amp just distortion I use this pedal with vintage Fender Silverface amps which are already bright so I turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the Spark Booster that I have in front of the US Dream I have to use the Spark Booster to hit the US Dream hard because most of the guitars I use dont have hot enough pickupsThe price was right Im happy with it Great pedal bright,positive
I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price After trying to use it I promptly returned it I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer I tried recording on the H2 using its line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean good quality sound The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problemThe H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings look for something else I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal but not as bad as the H2 I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR07 which I am very happy with It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder Poor quality recorder,negative
I bought this to use with my keyboard I wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals It doesnt work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what Id always used Doesnt have the same feel either Nowhere closeIn my opinion a sustain pedal like the MAudio SP2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better The only thing Ive found the Yamaha FC5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals Definitely Not For The Seasoned Piano Player,negative
It was my favorite capo Someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment Had to buy another one Nice capo,positive
I got what I ordered However if I had paid more attention this is nothing but a standard power supply which I could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the Tascam name on itUPDATE 5032012 after receiving comments and reading other reviewsIve gotten a comment and have read many comments and I dont know where the fault lies but this power supply is NOT the power supply for the new replacement Tascam DR07MKII The power supply for that unit is the PSP515UIf you are unsure what power supply for which model Tascam recorder you have go to Tascams website and research it before buying itThe Tascam PSP520 AC AdapterPower Supply For Mpgt1 is for and DOES work with the older Tascam DR07 recorder I have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered PA head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent New power supply for DR07MKII is not this power supply,positive

I bought this guitar about 2 years ago and I have played tons of different acoustic guitars from Taylor to Fender and more This is by far the nicest acoustic guitar I have played The action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well I love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars Additionally this is my favorite guitar and I would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic This guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars The guitar has no finish which I prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands I love Takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value This guitar will last forever because it was made so nice Recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature I promise you wont be disappointed and I have been playing for 6 years so I know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar Thanks Takamine Top of the line guitar,positive
Used this foot pedal for a and so far Ive had know problems Replaced the battery only once Good product for a inexpensive foot pedal Nice Foot Pedal for the Price,positive
I figured at this price I wouldnt be able to use this strap to secure my Dean from Hell guitar But figured if it wasnt up to being a reliable strap for my expensive pretty heavy ax that I could always use it for my Rock Band guitar And Im rather certain that this strap will outlast the Rock Band guitar So very pleased with this strap would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar thats likely 14 plastic and very lightweight Rock Band Strap,positive
Was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died Useless now I used the line input to tap into an aux feed that got recorded as it came off a live board For the price I guess I shouldnt complain too much Behringer often means trading price for longevity as the QC seems to be very hit and miss So now time to decide do I resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo bettaNote this is a low end but still pro audio piece of a equipment And while it truley doesnt get super loud for people who say it barely does anything volume wise I have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment If so your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the 4dBu line level signal that pro gear offers Subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with And as a result are getting poor volume plus the added bonus of increased distorion andor floor noise when you do try and crank it upUpdate well it works some days and not others it seems so a I keep it around for now as I am having more good days than bad days with it lately Cant really see a rhyme of reason to it connections dont seem loose or intermitant or anything like that I just either have good volume or it craps out It is in one permanent location used exacty the same way every time so its never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear Good while it lasted,positive
Great Price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar It does what it is designed for Cant ask for more Great Price,positive
There are so many reviews of this little jewel I wont bother going into details but its everything I could have hoped for and more The sound quality is amazing and its very easy to use Im using it for so many things including a music player for my truck I take it everywhere and it has never let me down I had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that ARE included I have no complaints I absolutely love this thing,positive
Genius concept It works for me perfectly I no longer lose or misplace my picks Easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in Itll depend on where you decide to place this Pickholder I placed mine right above the jack plug Genius concept for a Pickholder Really well designed and simple to use,positive
I am using it to record my garage bands demo to get us more gigs I have been a gigging musician for over 20 years Had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it I had two guitar tracks a bass track and drums tracks from garageband all laid down Easy to plug in I am using it with a MacBookPro and garageband Very quality recordings so far Like it so farEdit Put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic pg48 used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track easy to layer over harmonies Still have yet to mic up a drum kitStill enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use Did try to install software on a PC with Vista no luckEdit Micd up a drum kit into a mixer lined it out to this interface I then mixed the drum mics with the mixer You can record the drums as a single track so once theyre recorded you can not mix them individually ie snare kick and so on I do get very quality recordings with it set up this way I am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it but as for now I am very pleased I like it,positive
Small Light weight Stunning Fender Blackface looks Warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive The digital voicing is direct and easy to set up The fact that Fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me It is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio The direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recordermixer and still give you the amps skeaker as a monitor for yourself What could be easier And it mikes well too by the way The choice is yours thereWith no LED display cost increase if one was there and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive its so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun and practicle too The voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates The Tweed Blackface and Marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little ampLove the reverb in the FX section The spring reverb is so well done that I bumped the amp once and was looking for the spring chrash known from amps with the real spring reverb Its that good Once again the controls are easy and direct Never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort Who cares if it doent have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection You want that go waste your money on a Line 6 or something This Champ is made for one thing To give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort I believe it has accomplished that wellAgain a shame that Fender has dropped this model from the line up of products The super model is a step up in power and speaker size but also the cost is higher as well Im just glad that I got one of these from Amazon com when I did and will not part with the amp Been playing for five decades now and I know when I have a good instrument or gear and when I dont This model is a keeper to be sure And I dont even like digital Hows that for an endorsement Its that good for what it does Wonderful amp Too bad it has been dropped from Fenders line,positive
I read some of the reviews and that people almost had to guess what strings were what However on the bag that it comes with to prevent corrosion and on the box itself have a color coded guide saying what string is what color on the nut The strings themselves are the normal color for strings Color coded,positive
For the money this ones a nobrainer Its a onetrick pony but thats what its supposed to be and it does its trick very well Sounds better than the Ibanez or Boss models warmer and less processedsounding Plugged into a solidstate amp at its lowest drive setting it sounds like youre playing clean through a tube amp Plugged into my 65 Twin Reverb not a reissue but the real thing WOWI just got it a couple of weeks ago but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem Dont be a gear snob who looks down on lesserexpensive products the sound is what matters Dont get the Tube Screamer,positive
These picks are nylon so each one will last you a couple of years as long as you dont lose them this is thicker than the 60mm so you can dig into the strings a little better but still a hair flimsier than the Snarling Dogs 73mm picks I know theyre the same size but trust me these are 34flimsier34 and the grip is ok You cant go wrong here Almost as good as Snarling Dogs picks but not quite,positive
If you are looking for a 100 leather mandolin strap consider another strap The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of manmade material glued to the thin leather part I will be ordering the Levys Leather Mandolin Strap Walnut Strap not 100 leather,negative

Once I read about the Bugera B5 I knew I wanted one Why futz with tubelike effects when you can have real live tubes two in fact Only five Watts yes but thats still enough to fill a room But its the extras that cinch the deal this is built like a brick house you can jump up and down on it if you want to It has an internal cable for the speaker so you can easily plug in a different cabinet Comes with builtin reverb Headphone jack standard Best of all an attenuator so you can get the cranked sound even at low volume levels Easily upgradeable I put new tubes and speaker into mine though I probably didnt have to A small but effective little ampEdit I had modded my Bugera with a Jensen MOD8 and used it for bass but recently I found a source for Celestion Super 8 drivers and popped one of those in Amazing lowend output for such a small cab The finest little alltube practice amp on the market,positive
I ordered these as both a spare and to use with my lower end keyboard a Casio PX320 so I could leave my expensive Roland RD300NX in my home studio Much to my surprise this cable is pro quality Its as noise free as myMonster Rock 21 Instrument Cable and I cannot tell the difference between the two cables when I am using this one with either or my keyboards The remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the Monster modelIll give the Monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction but where it matters signal transmission I frankly cannot tell the two apart Part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise And I am sure that the oxygenfree copper conductor also has something to do with it Both the every expensive Monster cable and this one share some high end components and constructionI love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the Monster It does a better job of holding flex to a minimum although the connectors on the Monster are a better qualityBottom line the Monster cable wins out in few places but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk In fact I will probably keep the Monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging For one thing there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one and for another this costs a fifth of what I paid for the Monster Even if you insist on using the more expensive cables this is a great one to have as a spare Excellent performance and value,positive
I know spending this kind of money on a pedal that doesnt even add an effect to your tone sounds pretty crazy but this is definitely worth it If you think about it when your guitar is out of tune it doesnt matter how perfect every aspect of your playing equipment and setup is you will still sound bad So in a way this is the most important pedal you can haveThis pedal works great as a tuner and very vividly displays how far off you are from being in tune Works great as a mute switch too just one click and youve got no sound perfect for switching guitars andor just muting all soundThe design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid I definitely recommend this pedal Great tuner a must have,positive
I used AC30 for years lost them and decided to make a change and buy theseSound quality of AC30 wasnt anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains but this one has a horrendous clean tried with my strat and tele play jazzblues mostly and mediocre gain you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers buying a 2535 buck connector cable though granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gainy settingsFor people worried about CONSTRUCTION these turned out to be very sturdy AC30s i previously used did but the builtmaterials are exactly sameEven if youre determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps go for cheaper models or simply buy AC30 the latter has acceptable cleans Stick with the AC30 or better yet use your Iphonecomputer as an amp,negative
What to say about this except that they mounted properly came with the right screws and I didnt have any issues LOL Well LOL,positive
This thing sounds great I run two outputs from this into my DAW Reaper so that I can have a direct DI for reamping and the regular tone from the Hartkes preamp for an overall bass tone The general sound of it is warm with plenty of low end and the Shape control is pretty cool for adding a little bit of distortionbreakup for layering Its easy to reamp with so layering the unshaped Hartke tone another track of shaped gritty tone can get you some seriously solid sounding bass tones in a mix especially for higher gain metal playingAwesome unit for the price very happy with it Great tone dedicated DI is a huge bonus,positive
Provides everything I need from a mic stand Everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm Packs up small I knocked off one star because if you look carefully at the stand it leans ever so slightly It is after all a cheap Chinese stand Solid stand for home recording,positive
Easy to mount solid grip on guitar Only detractor would be that with my guitar at least it hangs kind of far from the wall This obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though An acoustic would clear the wall nicely my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wallSilicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar without marring even soft woodI very much prefer this to having it on one of the accident waiting to happen stands on the floor Does the trick,positive
Excellent product at a righteous price Helps my guitar stay in tuneChanged the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better Fender locking tuners,positive
Greatgreat sound The sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get They also teach a guitar player to use a lighter touch while playing to produce beautiful sounds Well worth it PK,positive

I installed the Ragin Cajun into my Fender Super Champ XD I read all of the reviews of people saying this speaker turned their Super Champ into a monster and man they were right I immediately noticed a difference in the warmth articulation and fullness of my sound The cleans are warm andclean and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely I had been trying to play Tools Jambi and the beginning part never sounded right I always thought I was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned Tried the same lick with the Ragin Cajun and it sounds perfect I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone that owns a Fender Super Camp XD or needs a 10 inch speakerTwo items of note 1 A few people said this is a bass heavy speaker and I do not agree While it is slightly darker than the stock speaker it has a screaming MidLow range A quick turn of the Treble knob from 4 to 6 cleaned up the darkness 2 Dont forget the first time you install the speaker will be the worst it will sound All speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot With that said this thing sounds amazing directly after install Buy you wont regret Rajin Indeed,positive
I purchase a set of these and first off the case itself is worth 10 dollars It is a quality heavy cloth case with a feltvelvet lining The harmonicas are almost unbearable to play as soon as they arrive as they reek like plastic and oil but after leaving the case open 2 days they barely smell and they are still airing out I love how light they are due to the plastic cases even if they arent super loud They are a great buy for the money as I simply wanted a cheap set to mess around with and try out different keys The notes are slightly difficult to bend but the reeds are still loosening up All the notes play but a few of the higher ones needed a little encouragement with overblowing and lightly breaking them in a little but the harps all sound great after 5 mins of break in I am quite happy with the product and they honestly could be much worse for the price The blues and set is only 10 dollars more with metal casings and probably better components but these were good too I would recommend to anyone who has a decent harmonica in C but wants to experiment with other keys Good buy Great for price,positive
Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task and you have to make sure the pin config is correct This one is a good product and works just fine Midi to Midi,positive
I have finally discovered that the 34perfect set34 is a moving target As arthritis creeps in I find myself playing heavier strings with a lower action and these work in that respect Another advantage of usiung this set is that it beefs up the treble side without making the bass side too boomey Telecaster anyone Good balance low action,positive
Nothing that spectacular really It did its job Was easy for my husband to use Made me able to use a strap on my guitar Needed this for a used guitar,positive

Used these for years on sons electric guitars No fuss Mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping No way at all to knock the guitar off the wall No neck damage to axes Mounts well but try to find a stud certainly Keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wallNo complaints If youre going to drill your wall is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers All 5 star reviews on this baby And I agree and I add to that total 5 stars Owned at least four of these,positive
Seems like it draws current even when its OFF I have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar I make sure to turn this tuner OFF before putting the guitar away and when I get around to playing the guitar again 7 to 10 days later the battery is already drained This happened at least three times already The tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that I have to compare against I dont know which one is more accurate The good thing is its very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it I probably wont buy again for my other and future guitars Goes through batteries too fast,neutral
Ive been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels These strings I have to say stretched out and stayed in tune much faster than slinkys They have great sustain and sound nice and chunky I love the luster and shine of new strings feels nice ans springy Since this is my first time with this brand I dont know how long they will stay good but well see Get these,positive
I personally own two of these Snarks and Ive seen several others among my friends Theyre great easytoread and easytouse tuners that are surprisingly cheapHowever half of the Snarks Ive come into contact with have broken within a few weeks One of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage The screen is SUPER faint Its still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting This also happened to two of my friends SnarksMy other Snark is still going strong Id still recommend them for noncritical applications just for the price and ease of use However these definitely arent reliable gigworthy tuners Theyre just so cheap its easy to buy multiple Snarks and cover all of your guitars Hard to Beat for the Price but High Defect Rate,neutral
I love these strings they never stop amazing me wether you use them for electric or acoustic they always work well clean bright tones and heavy riff giving these strings last and work well Ive never tried another type of strings and I dont think I will ernie ball always wins,positive
I recently acquired a Guild six string that I strung with my usual EJ16 strings however it just wasnt playing or sounding as good as I knew it could After tweaking the action and restringing with EJ17 Mediums that Guild has sounds great with plenty of punch power to spareOverall I rely on DAddario strings for all my instruments Whats not to love about a 300 yearold familyowned company that beginning with the days of catgut has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations Beyond great tone playability these suckers are reliable as all getout These days if a string breaks I know right away I need to check the nut saddle because these strings dont snap unless something on the instrument caused damage In fact I used to snap strings every other performance before I learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use NOTHING but DAddario strings I havent broken a string during a performance in years and believe me I aint being gentle with em DAddario is the only string for me,positive
Nice to keep your mic nice and fresh Plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath Decent value Save your MIC and cut the background NOISE,positive
Havent used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected So far so good I recommend it Good,positive
I definately helps cut down 34wind whistle34 on my mic cant say anything great about the product but I cant say anything bad It does what it is suppose to Works,neutral
Use it every time I restring my guitar works really good I recommend this to any musician that plays regulary Great tool,positive
Its not as nice as my Audio Technica one but this does the job and Im happy A little flimsier than the AT but at the price its good Works good,positive
I thought to try this tuner after my gig bag decided to break my Snark SN2s neck fragile plastic socket of the ball socket joint bent with stress Functionally I prefer the SN2 which seems to do slightly more sample averaging while remaining responsive displaying less 34bounciness34 I also prefer the SN2 display However theres a lot to be said about the small form factor which I can leave on the headstock without risk of damage Now I keep an NS on each of the mandolins that travel with me and I keep a Snark clipped to the music stand at home Good function better formfactor,neutral
Ive found no issues with noise or build quality so far the 1 foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their inputoutputs in weird places These work fine no issues,positive
I wind longscale bass strings onto my unusual supershortscale 26scale sixstringed bass instrument so Im betting I get more use out of this thing than about anybody This device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster The cutter worked great too Changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore Cant ask for more than that A real time aggravation and fatigue saver,positive
It isnt the softest strap But the width makes it feel better till its 34brokenin34 Good leather that should last a long time I have very similer straps that have lasted 30 years Nice,positive
Excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noiseDoes not have an onoff switch which is a bit disappointing Robust,positive
Wonderful and inexpensive strap I use these for all my electrics and have had no problemsWell made and easy to adjust Wonderful and inexpensive strap,positive
I have an abundance of strat parts So when a vintage nonstrat type guitar came acrossed my workbench I plunked these on the pots The customer liked them so much he kept them on Now what to do with these other knobs Looks good on other guitars too,positive
Ive had good success with this piece I use it with a straight mic stand topped with a Shure Super 55 for vocals I put a Heil Fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax The arm allows for a variety of positions and serves to eliminate a second stand just for the horn mic My only small 34concern34 is the length of the arm itself If it was a bit shorter or adjustable it would help offset the potential balance issue created from having a mic hang that far off the stand In my case I am using a heavy microphone so I didnt rate down the product for this reason as I know Im pushing the issue I doubt that if someone was attaching a lighter microphone to the arm it would be a issue That said its a great way to get rid of a second unnecessary stand cluttering up your stage We ended up buying a total 4 for our stage and freed up a ton of floor space A highly recommended piece Excellent secondary mic arm,positive
After buying this product I have concluded that 800 is a lot of money for foam Does the job but I think the velcro job would be preferable to this one lot of money for foam,neutral
Im a beginner and I try to learn to play guitar I was looking for many different capos but this one was my choice base on other folks review Is easy to apply small and sexy Excellent Capo,positive
I was skeptical because of the price but these work great It is even large enough to use with my 12 String Great,positive
THis device is ok It is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable Convenient storage is its biggest plus A Decent Aid to String Changing,neutral
OnStage makes decent products but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times That would have been perfect Otherwise it works fine Ok but it would be nice if the table was collapsible,neutral
This is one of the nicer capos Ive used Certainly superior to the old school bandbased jobs from yesteryear One of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab position release and go Heck you could probably place it midsong if you were so inclined to do soAlso it clamps without bending the stringsIve used it on my Start Les Paul and Martin all with no complaints I hardly ever use a capo but if I need one I am glad to have this one Light fast accurate buzz free mostly,positive
These little patch cables have been indispensable since I used them to set up my pedalboard Theyre durable and tough yet provide a high level of flexibility when it comes to using them in tight spaces inbetween effects pedals I previously had been using some Fender Tweed patch cables and they just werent flexible enough even though they looked cool for days So if youre looking for a great patch cable for your pedalboard look no further my friend Perfect Flexibility And Durability For A Pedalboard,positive
It is a nice strap It takes care of business just fine I wish I could have found a more colorful style but all I could find on line was black But its a very good strap Nice strap,positive
I had the Behringer DR 600 Ultra Reverb but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds Although this unit is only 10 more the difference in sound and tone may as well be 100 difference in quality of sound That is this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences It may not have every reverb sound but it has a nice selection and they cover an impressive range as well as giving you the option of 34wet34 full or 34dry34 tinny sounds and a 34trails34 that essentially adds some sustain Theres also an 34echo34 setting but its not very pronounced though it does add an 34echolike34 soundSo my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualitiesThere are a couple of annoying inconveniences One is the BRIGHT blue light indicating 34on34 This has been commented on before I have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined When its on you cant read the dials because of the glare in your eyes I did find a solution I put dark nail polish over the LED bulb I had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming I desiredThe second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color This is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting Of course you can 34remember34 where it is or which one it is but my other Behringer pedals all have white lettering making them much easier to read Every B pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps My solution to this little dilemma was to buy some 1434 white vinyl letters from Office Depot and put them over the words 34REVERB34 on the pedalIt was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes but now Im much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations Good sound some annoying minor issues,positive
This unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a USB audio input I have not used the headphone monitoring section doubt I ever would so I cannot comment on that feature but this unit is so simple to use that I was pleasantly surprisedFor anyone in a band out there I used this device to take a line out from our PA system into an old laptop running free Audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording This even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage Great Simple USB Audio Interface,positive
This pedal is solidly built and works as advertised If youre using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicelyThe only problem with it is when you use it as an expression pedal it has no polarity switch for expression outputPlugged into some gear as an expression pedal my Digitech RP55 for example the down position is muted and the up position is full volume the opposite of where it should be and wah effects are backwards as well Theres no way to correct this without making your own crossover cable which requires destroying a perfectly good patch cable Solid and does the job but watch out for polarity,positive
ive used many brand for my guitars for years this one is very good long lasting guitar strings balanced tone as it says on the box and special coating system makes strings last longer than noncoated ones from lusting easy to install and use and very reasonable price thanks amazon for this product sale good guitar string,positive
i think this is the best tuner i love it it really works and its really easy to use it best,positive
I needed this for my Jazzmaster that has a front face input Sounds fine although that guitar is notably 34hummy34 with the single coils I dont feel this cable added any more noise in the line Looks cool and sounds good to me and great price I actually bought 2 Nice Cable,positive
I used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics It was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do Highly recommended Cleaned up my necks nicely,positive
A inexpensive guitar stand that was easy to assemble 1 minute and holds up well Very pleased with this purchase Great,positive
So far so good And I know if anything goes wrong I just have to return it to a local dealer Well worth the investment Great Quality Lifetime Warranty,positive
Yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this Trick treat your room with sound deadening Easy To Use Sounds Great,positive
This is a handy little tool The winder is nice and the clipper works well It doesnt pull the bridge pegs out so it doesnt get five stars from me And dont be too rough when winding or it will break Pretty good,positive
Have not used the strings yet I bought them as back up Have used this type of string before with satisfactory results good tone last a long time Bought as back up,positive
These arent the dirtcheap these actually have some nicer connectors midgrade level They arent the cheap type with a rubber boot that pretends to be a strainrelief these are screw on plastic bits with a more sturdy housing Decent cables and arent too expensive Will buy again Seem to be higher quality,positive
most guitar shapes and sizes fit on this guitar standit is easy to assemble and theres really not much to it but the fact that its a guitar standnothing special about it good guitar stand,positive
I really enjoyed this tuner extremely fast an accurate at tracking you Ive been surching for a decent tuner for about a few months now and Ive demoed the pitchblack and the planet waves tuner all never could track me as well as the TU3 could What I mean by tracking me Im talking about how fast it can respond to me changing the pitch Its a great tuner a little pricy but worth it in the long run I was even surprised they included a battery Fast,positive
The On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand is a decent quality simple guitar stand like almost all the others so here is how I rated it There are really high quality stand of the same design but i will not use those stands as a comparison Seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt If you somehow made one that retails for over 30 and are able to sell it I applaud your marketing teamContinuing on this is how I rated the On Stage XCG4If it were over 13 it would have gotten 3 starsBetween 7 and 13 earns it 4 starsif it were under 7 it would have gotten 5 starsI hope this helpsJPS The currency is in US dollars Please adjust accordingly Its a guitar stand so not much to say about it unless its truly badly made,positive
These really do work well but it is a difficult struggle to get them separated at 1st They stick together too well and it is hard to separate them at 1st without ripping the individual pads I found it a little easier putting them in the fridge over night then slowly pulling them apart I also thought about heating them a little or perhaps adding a few drops of water However chilling them did work well enough That aside these will greatly improve the way any set sounds Ive been a pro drummer for over 45 years and have used masking tape little cloth squares tapped down lots of different things There work best by far and are easily moved around depending on the room you are in and the sound you want Great stuff Oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills That can help and a great drum doesnt sound so good if it isnt tuned right great effect with one little issue,positive
I am trying to learn to play violin but was having difficulty finding the proper fingering for the notes This has been very helpful for me to check finger position I will be removing it when I can consistently find the proper placing for my fingers This has also help me in tuning the violin Very helpful tool for learning,positive
My first uke so I cannot compare but it sounds great I dont know what stock strings it came loaded with but they sounded just fine Excellent value,positive
The mixer arrived early which was a lifesaver I immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone preamps were used for three vocalists and one flute and the CD input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists Everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs I am looking forward to using more of the effects The Best Mixer for SmallMid Applications,positive
Seems sturdy enough and no noise issues so Im pretty much satified with it it doesnt leave the house so Im not asking it to handle a lot but with reasonable care it should last a while Works wonderfully no noise,positive
I was very pleased when I got my Beatles Tin and Collector Picks The service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable I was surprised at how cool both the Tin and the Picks were they are a real talking point and a must have for Musos who like individual items in their collection Thanks again Cheers Excellent Product,positive
Seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it It was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks Not bad for the money,positive
I get everything on Amazon now Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time Stretch them bend them and they dont break If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently Thanks much there strings,positive
Love these guitar stands Sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price You will pay up to 4x more for similar stands Great bargain Great quality low price,positive
I love the freedom the G30 gives me Im a real klutz with my cordsespecially on the ML designed guitars So I figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun The sound is a lot more there Between this the Bill Lawrence humbuckers that the sound is unforgiving and those mistakes will come through real clearmaking you work on your technique and become a better playerI took off a star because I dont like the prospect of being a slave to Duracell I am hoping that rechargeable batteries will be good enough for my needs and Ill give it 5 starsSideNote the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me I suggest ordering some better ones No More Wirehangers,positive
nice wide lip sturdy appears to be well made and durable nice finish on it hopefully will last a long time music stand,positive
It looks nice on our Fender Blacktop Bass plus the locks it completely changed the look of the bass details Great for Bass and Guitar,positive
It arrived on time I have an Epiphone Hummingbird acoustic guitar so I needed a pickup for do some recordingit works well but Its not very loud This thing should sound louder next time Ill buy a Duncan pickup Its OK for the price,neutral
as another guy said 34how could i live without this pedal before34 i agree with that i got two of these one for my base guitar one for my guitarsimply outstanding simply the best thank u mxr holly molly,positive
Personally I love the nanoweb strings I have 4 guitars and they each get played once every couple weeks As Im no pro I dont want to put strings on them that Im going to have to change every time just to mess around at my aptI dont mind that they are extra slippery or that they sound a tad bit different than other strings Theyre exactly what I want A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings These will last you the rest is taste,positive
I previously had the UCA202 and it worked great for me for a couple of years but I noticed the audio went dead in one of the RCA phono input jacks I had used those jacks previously with no issues Regardless I liked the UCA202 so much that I got the UCA222 to replace it without hesitation plus as a bonus its purdier Plugged it in just now fired up the PC the new UCA222 started working immediatelyno muss no fuss For the money I dont think you can find a better deal for enhancing your PCs audio versatility I dont know if Ill even bother with the included software as I use a great program called Mixcraft btw check that out if youre looking for PC recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other costlier guys Anyway two thumbs way up for the UCA222 Great recording aid for pocket change,positive
Super cool pedal with tons of applications it sounds great for recording i wouldnt take it on a tour or anything it is plastic the harmonizing function can be buggy at times the trem function works great it has a input for an expression pedal and i would recommend using one to save your pedal the wearit is plastic I love Behringer pedals for the price you can get a ton of great sounding and functioning pedals at more than half the price of the Boss counterparts one of my favorite pedals of all time Super awesome pedal,positive
This is a really solid table mic stand and youre not going to find a better price I looked The base is solid and heavy and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube I liked the first one enough that I ordered a second I should note though that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips which I can imagine being disappointing even though it didnt affect me Awesome for the price,positive
Its not fancy but its well though out and you cant beat the value The edges dont cut your neck and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want Like others I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want and it flexiblethin enough to go through the buckles if needed Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass Excellent Value very adjustable,positive
This is a very good cable I dont forsee having any problems with it Its just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables If you need this get it The price is right and shipping was right on time Just right,positive
A bit wimpy but so far they are holding up Three Stars,neutral
I keep going back and forth between DR High Beams and these My teacher really likes the High Beams but these are half the price and the tone is just great and surely a new set of these are going to have more 34oomph34 than a set of High Beams I keep a little too long because they cost more Recommended Cant beat the value,positive
I use these on my basses and they do the job quite well They are easy to install on the bass and the strap like it,positive
True to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound You still get finger noise as you slide your fingers when setting up for the next chord but the noise is somewhat less I have used other Elixir nonweb coated strings and these strings are in par with them I cant speak to the string life The boast of these strings is that will last 3 to 5 times longer and if that is the case I will run out of time to submit my feedback So far now they sound great feel greatand if they dont last as long as the other Elixirs youll still come out ahead since they shouldnt cost any more they sound great feel great,positive
I see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts Much more fun than a black box I own one of each model The New Standard for the industry,positive
Just got this have used it for recording and rehearsal it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years Right now though Id say great product Great so far,positive
I used to use the Martin tube thing that you stick between the strings But it was a bit of a pain You had to soak it then drain it then wipe it Even then I worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar This is much easier and the guitar sounds great Highly recommended Easy and works well,positive
Let me begin with a Public Service Announcement If you want to buy other EZDrummer expansion packs YOU NEED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT FIRSTIMPORTANT UPDATE Toontrack is scheduling the public release of EZ Drummer 20 in May 2014 If you buy EZ Drummer 10 from now until then you will ALSO get the download for 20 Bear in mind EZD2 is a completely newdifferent program from EZD1 and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 PopRock Kit which has some very kit pieces in addition to the EZD2 default kit which is more reminiscent of the ROCK expansion kit from what Ive seen EZ Drummer 20 also gives you the ability to mixmash kit pieces from all expansions and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMINGIf you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck youll find Its very easy to use very easy to program and overall a well made product You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother Superior Drummer 20 made by the same company Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact closetolife sounding virtual instrumentThere are ways to improve the offtheshelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation Pro Tools Cubase etc and set EZDrummer for multitrack output From there youll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal Most highend professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at Kick Drum Snare Top and Bottom Toms Cymbals Overhead and Room Once you have each of those outputs running you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically Adding a touch of distortiongain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY closetolife In reality once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced it only takes a trained ear to tell that its a virtual kitAs far as the expansions go if you are looking to record a particular style of music then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD after performing the mods above but only for Rock As for me personally I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone but in the end I found the Rock kit lacking especially since its a tight kit 3 toms 3 cymbals 1 hihat 1 snare 1 kick EZ breezy beautiful drummer girl,positive
Ive used this strap on different guitars and it works great on all of them If youre looking for an economical strap this will work great My experience has been that Ernie Ball makes great products Great buy,positive
Im used to the old 70s and 80s speakers that Ive had on my stereo since that time I read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before I was blown away They are all correct get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing I listen all the time with different headphones not the same The way the music was separated so well I swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals I had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out I dont know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when I use them to watch movies listen to music etc They have lots of punch even when I play my guitar through them POD HD PRO Blow Away,positive
these come in multiple thickness and are great because of the thickness and the grip that is on the pick makes it much easier to hold the pick as your hands get sweaty Great picks,positive
Nothing sounds as bright as these strings Ive tried many and these are the best by far I know cause I playem geetar real goodlike the only string I use,positive
Im used to conventional steel finger picks These actually work really well as long as you dont play hard like I sometimes do with my other picks Playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks However these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly Great for soft playing,positive
When this little plastic gizmo arrived I admit I had low expectations for it At first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and I figured the plastic would soon break I really did not expect much accuracy in tuning eitherI have used this for a couple of months now switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works wellI may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck Good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner It works as well as my expensive model I was using and I dont have to stick it on the guitar body Worth checking out By Golly It Works,positive
I needed a small collapsible stand which would fit in my backpack with my little amp cables and stuff This is perfect love it Great stand for its size,positive
Good quality cable and sounds very good Five Stars,positive
I have both black and white Ernie ball straps really comfortable easy to adjust holds guitar securely and both colors look great with black guitars Well made Durable and Simple,positive
I actually purchased this item refurbished on eBayIt is out there for 230 to 299No buzzing and crackling and NO MORE WIRESNo more shorts in the cables or stepping over cordsFinally the technology is here for inexpensive wirelessThe Relay G30 has perfect frequency response because it is in the 24GHz band like a wireless WiFi router or cordless phoneAll the soft clipping is there for every nuanceIn fact I dont hear any interference at all even with a single coilSome feedback is good but not that screaming feedback loop from cables missing their groundsI play directly into a Line 6 POD and can piggy back Wah pedals and other effects with the Relay G30 on front It is just like having an adjustable length guitar cableThis is a professional wireless systemBest purchase Ive made this yearYou wont be disappointed it is worth the price Better than cables by far,positive
I have other capos and decided to try this one and I have to say I love it I have used the Kyser spelling for years as my favorite and that is a good capo but I will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz I will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up but I love it so farI use it on my Taylor 910ce Taylor 718e and my Epiphone Anniv accoustic LOVE IT,positive
Does what it is suppose to do What can you say about a tool If it works properly and it does what more can you say Works,positive
This mute allows me to practice without annoying my family and does not harm the violin It seems well made Cuts volume in half,positive
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup always getting the question34Can i hook my keyboard into your sound board34 Feel good to say that now I have the capability now bring on the keyboard,positive
At first I wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my MIM Stratocaster for it was the last thing I needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo After installing these tremolo springs which by the way have a nice flexible tension I notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved I did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like 2030 to enhance tone and sustain on Stratocasters So at 8 this is definitely a WIN Great springs,positive
I like everything about this mike except one No gain adjustment on the mike You have to do it from the software That was a big disappointment because I had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustmentOf course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably wont care But if you are recording instruments particularly loud instruments you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps Gain adjustment in software only,neutral
Sat on my Snark Good tuner but takes some patience No quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc Would probably buy again however will also get another Snark much easier for quick stage sight tuning Good but touchy,positive
Very nice product great quality I ordered three to start was not sure if I wanted to trust my Guitars to them Arrived installed in minutes they come with plastic toggles to screw into drywall I chose to hit studs Rubber washers come with to size for different necks If you are going to mount off a stud I strongly suggest using an aftermarket high quality toggle made from steel Very happy going to order more Hang Um Up,positive
well Behringer have to say that the electronics are german mind with all that says go figure it out for yourself other then that plastic so i give 4 stars cuz of the soft plastic case and the trouble of changing batteries but u can use the charger and u will be well off sound is really awesome for the money and it is high standard delay time and sound i dont think u can get the german quality anywhere else for 30 bucks i say buy it it is a great delay pedal and not only the delay most all Behringer effects are sounding great for the money can not go wrong electric fingers,positive
I have four of these and will continue to use this product Youll purchase this system first then all you need to do is get the replacement packs For my Taylor Baby the string spacing was a little small but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars Very easy to use As a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition I would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments Keeps my Guitars in Shape,positive
So far I really like these The thickness is about right for me which is sort of a lightmedium The grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool I got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out I doubt I will lose them No more dropping picks,positive
The construction fabric color and padding are all A1 This is a super bag My precious uku will always be protected and look good too Excellent gig bag,positive
I use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it A day doesnt go by where the stand is not in use I use this stand,positive
Ive always used Ernie Ball strings Ive tried others always go back to Ernie Balls They sound feel great Bend em Great strings,positive
This is a very simple product and as others have stated you could probably just DIY one pretty easilybut for this price why bother Under 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from 2050 I dont think the material the time it is going to take for you to make one about 30 minsan hour more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online andvoila It arrives two days later no fuss no muss assuming you have Prime because well who doesnt these days PLUS this will look good on camera For the price I dont see how you will find something better,positive
This stand is ok for light home use I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel Very cheaply made but does the job Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack Avoid if you can spend more Flimsy,negative
Im using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks It was smaller then I would have pictured but it still is a good product It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in Besides that its highly recommendable to anyone I will definitely pick up more for my other axes Decent pick holder,positive
I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps Bought one and due to past neck surgery found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes Later saw this one and decided to try it Works perfect really adjustable and no pressure on my neck since it doesnt go around your neck Great design Smart design,positive
Its not going to win any awards for sound quality but it sure is cute As you might expect its a pretty boxy sounding little amp more reminiscent of 60s portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall But it did the two things I wanted it for First it has a belt clip which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap Second it has a headphone out so I can plug in a set of ear buds 1834 stereo jack You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum Surprisingly the Drive control works its way in gradually letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control With the drive control cranked up you can get the amp unexpectedly loud but terribly distorted For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go its not too bad With a set of earphones I would put it on par with some of the more expensive ampjacks that are available If you plan to use it as a practice amp and youre not moving about I would recommend getting a power supply will use the same ones as most effects pedals Battery life appears to be around 35 hours but the performance starts degrading at about an hours use Its cute,positive
These just dont have the right feel and the sound isnt that great compared to other materialsThe quality control is so so The picks arent cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around themIll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip 96mm or PRS 10 picks For more flexibility or acoustic I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks Not the right feel,neutral
These tubes just arent for me They dont sound greatkind of flat and lifeless Also unreliable One out of 7 arrived DOA and another has failed since Just not for me,neutral
Say it all but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece A great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic Squire Great Replacement better quality than the original,positive
I was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive I dont hold it against the pedal though I have a Marshall Class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive I get from the amp I say this as a compliment In my case however why would I want to replicate what I already have Im gonna return it and save up some money to get a BB preamp You should check out the 78 Badasss Distortion from MXR too not a bad pedal but not what i wanted either,positive
need to learn to read since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ok bandaid a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others worked great,positive
A looper pedal has been on my list of things Id like to get some day for a long long time Why I waited so long to get one I cant say All I can say is how glad I am not only that I finally got one but that I got this one It is fantastic Heres whyFirst ease of use I really thought Id be slowly working my way through a long manual then slowly figuring out how to use the pedal On the contrary I got this out of the box plugged it in and was recording my first loops in a matter of minutes The instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps This manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars As I delved deeper into the options I was able to quickly figure out how to do everything I wanted to doSecond user interface Its a pedal Its got knobs and buttons This makes me very happy Its well laid out and easy to get to all the settings Once youve got it up and running I strongly recommend setting it up so you can set a rhythm on a new loop by tapping the pedal The work flow with this thing is just very logical and simpleThird features It has built in drum beats that are simple but sound better than just a metronome and help you get in the mood to jam out your loops The beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loopFourth plays nice with computers Theres a usb port and you can connect this to the computer with a standard cable not included and copy your loops to the free downloadable loop library software There you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize themFifth comes with an AC adapter It actually has to since it does not run on batteries but still I was happy to see it in the boxSixth you can add an SD card not included to expand the memory substantiallyAll of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience The experience for me has been pure jamming joy I hear a song in my head and very quickly have the basic concept captured as a loop You can plug your electric guitar or a mic into the input so you can capture anything you wantFor the price this is a wonderful piece of gear and my only regret is not having bought one sooner Im having so much fun with it Oh my sweet sweet goodness I love this pedal,positive
Hi guys Really simple little review here This is a windscreen It does windscreen thingsPros1 It works2 It fits my microphoneCons1 The package game a little smushed so its a little misshapenIts 2 it works If its not the highest quality stop complaining Its 2 what did you expect kevlar Its a windscreen,positive
my only complaint is that it doesnt seem as accurate as some traditional tuners but thats probably by design so you arent fiddling over fractions of a semitone when youre trying to tune your guitar between songssets seems to work well,positive
I have used Ernie Ball strings for along time Mostly slinkys or super slinkys I read the review on these and thought I would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a LPI bought these to replace the stockers on the EPI LP 100 I just bought Luckily I order two packs I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet and pop it broke I had ordered two sets so I put on the one from the new set No problems until I got to the G string then pop another breaker Very sad qualityAfter finally getting them on and in tune you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune especially the E I have to say they have a great sound to them Nice tone and sustain Great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too These are thick strings but still bendable just not very far I would rate the sound 5 starsUnfortunately it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are So I have to give these three stars overall Great sound but fickle quality,neutral
Love itnice mic to record acoustical instruments 13 more words word word word word word word word word word word Great Acoustic guitar mic,positive
I could never get the sound I wanted using other manufacturers strings I tried Ernie Ball Slinkys just for shiggles I was quite surprised at the quality of the tone I get from my guitars now There is a rich toney presence to these springs The cheapest and most effective upgrade you can make on your axe is Ernie Ball strings Hands down the best Its Ernie Ball from now on,positive
Pretty straight forward bench I was surprised at how comfy it was at the price Good height comfortable Id buy it again no questions asked Cool product,positive
It does the job it was intended to do Before using this I just hooked the strap to the buttons and didnt like it To confined and with the quick release it was more comfortable to use the strap Im glad I purchased this when I did Does the job,positive
I like purple and it is purple The strap is sturdy It works what else needs to be said it arrived timely is decent quality and a nice color Strap for the Guitar,positive
They said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note youre playing up to three octaves but I could never get that feature to work properlyFrom video reviews Ive heard on YouTube this Harmonizer does not even come close to the Boss version but it costs about 100 less Since I am not a professional musician and I am just playing around with it it works just fine And you get what you pay forAddendum Ive now owned this for a while and discovered that it can turn my sixstring Strat into a bass by turning the balance knob all the way to the right and my pitch on the second from bottom position In fact when I record my Dean Edge bass onto the Boss Loop Station and then record my Strat on top of it using the Behringer Ultra ShifterHarmonist I cannot tell any difference in tonalityI am thinking of selling my bass It has just become a needless expense Needs the neck adjusted twice a year the strings are expensive and it is harder to play then my Strat Its okay for some things but really great for others,positive
Leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap I would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button The button is not a snap I just lack the word to describe it Previously I used to use a shoe lace and I would be thinking about it falling while playing Now I have more confidence with this strap Its not Gucci but doesnt feel like plastic either Nice quality product,positive
If you are a Beatle fan this is such a cute item Was more than I expected for the price Nice for collectable or to use very cute,positive
For about 8 you get a string winder string cutter and an acoustic peg remover allinoneWhat more can you ask forMine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of useI have nice wire cutters etc Im an EE but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or threeAs for quality it has an unconditional guarantee see abovePlanet Waves aka DAddario is a wellknown name in guitar accessoriesTo the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking try using your warranty instead of whiningNo manufacturer has a perfect run forever but at least in this case you have not wasted your moneyFor the record I do not work for DAddario Planet Waves but I would not dismiss a job offhand if they offered it Good value for a guitar tool and it comes with an unconditional guarantee,positive
I tried with with my Macbook Pro with both Mountain Lion and Mavericks Also with my Win7 x64 machine I tried it with a variety of MIDI capable gear including trying to update firmware on FX hardware sending and receiving MIDI PC and MIDI CC as well as transmitting MIDI Clock in and out I simply couldnt get this to work most of the time Active Sense used on most Roland products seems to kill it completelyIn contrast I purchased the MUs Xmidi 1x1 Tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time I use itI should have totally returned this product Instead its in a landfill I shouldve returned this,negative
If you dont like too much dirt in your tone this might be the pedal for youThe Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonallyIf you have a fairly clean single channel amp it wont give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels However if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking step on this pedal and youll be rewarded If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp set the gain low and boost it with this pedal The notes ring clear with the extra bite and brightness to cut thru the mixsweet You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesnt color your sound No midhumpI use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive OCD and the dirt channel on my ampThe pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made Its not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives Instead of a tone knob it has a focus knob which controls your picking dynamics and presence All the way to the left the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp All the way to the right when you pick the strings hard it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence The pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up wellYou cant get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess withThis pedal basically takes the sound of your amp adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after its a no brainer High Performance Low Budget,positive
If youd ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you It will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat It will locate a shorted XLR or an open ground fast Dont go onto the stage without one on these boxes Works great,positive
Very good cable Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor Guitar Cable,positive
I think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated 2nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preampI plugged it into my DAW and listened on my KRKs and was impressed by its sound The overdrive is quite good No it cant hold a candle to my J Rockett Pedals Alan Holdsworth Signature Overdrive but at 4800 its an absurdly good buy Its a good pedal but its actually a decent preamp,positive
This is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better Cheap case but does at least fit the guitar I like it but Im just playing for entertainment and at church some times Electronics are just volume and tone but it rocks my little battery powered Honeytone amp Nice finish nice guitar For the money Good for price,positive
If you understand what this is for I think its a great idea Maybe not a perfect tool but I believe it does what it is supposed to and does it wellKeeping in mind Im a guitar player who just bought a drum kit My assumptions when using this are that drum tuning is 34relative34 meaning that 99 of drum pitch is established by ear based on what you want each drum to sound like unlike a stringed instrument which is tuned against an absolute reference frequency and each string has a distinct relation to the othersThe concept with this torque key is that it assists you with applying equal tension on each of the tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all the way around the circumference of the head It by no means will help you establish as specific pitch on any drum it simply helps you achieve an even tension and 8220relative8221 pitch all around the head The tension numbers on the torque key are for reference only 2 is tighter than 1 3 is tighter than 2 and so on Yet these numbers are only relevant to each head I find that you dont necessarily pick a number such as 2 and tune all the drums to thatThe way I use this right or wrong is that I tune an approximate tune on any given head using the traditional method of tapping around the perimeter and tightening apposing rods as necessary until the pitch is the same all the way around and at an audible frequency that I like for the drum I8217m tuning Now theoretically you8217re pretty well tuned anyway but this is when I grab my torque key and I set it to a number a bit lower than were I expect the torque is this only comes from experience of using it a few times then I check a tension rod and I increase the setting on the torque key until it no longer 34breaks over34 Now whatever number Im on is the reference number for that drum My process from here is to move around the head in the same crisscross pattern as you would tuning traditionally but I loosen each rod a bit first and then bring it back up to torque with the torque key After this process my drum head should both be at a pitch that I have chosen by ear and have equal pitch all around the drum headI believe it is a common practice to use a slightly different tension on the bottom side head ether a little tighter or looser than the top side typically a little lower pitch on the bottom Once you8217ve tuned the top head and you know what number you8217ve used you can quickly tune the bottom by reducing or increasing a click or two on your torque keySure there are a few other variable that can come in to play like did you seat the head adequately when installing it which in essence means did you apply some light pressure to the center of the head while drawing down the tension rods in small equal amounts in a crisscross pattern Also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth These may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work How about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated Any variability in resistance of the threads on your torque rods will directly translate to pitch in that location Again Im just a rookie and I may be off with some of these assumptions or they may have an essentially unmeasurable impact so take it for what its worthOnce you find a tuning you like you could write down what number it took to achieve the pitch you like on each head that would make it easy to quickly get back to the same pitch ifwhen your drums need to be tuned again I believe it does what it is supposed to granted Im a rookie drummer,positive
Ive heard about the Snark tuners before and have seen them once in awhile but while skimming the music side of Amazon I finally picked this upand it works GREAT Something for me,positive
No much to these things but they are cheap and they work great in the studio They shipped quickly and didnt break the bank Great price on a necessity in the studio,positive
Like this camo capos simplicity and its unique color My friend got a new one after seeing me using it but his is a bit shorter than mine Mine works both uke acoustic guitar I have no problem to use it on single hand As the manufactor suggests for its duration I dont clip it on the guitar when its not in use easy to use beautiful,positive
The product arrived as in the description but I made the mistake to buy it for my Fender Squier Bullet not a full StratThere are 2 differences between this pickup covers and my Fender Squier First the magnet tips in the Squier are closer together I guess the fretboard is narrower than the Strats Second the Squiers has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickupMy solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent Not the most beautiful thing but workedThe other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly Pickup covers dont fit Fender Squiers,positive
Its a great string winder and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool Its a brilliant idea haha Its very good quality like all planet waves products Wonderful product,positive
I have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man the Neotech is by far superior to anything else I have hooked up to my Gibson ESS The straps are easy to hook and unhook I have two sets on my banjo one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest Its easy to uphook one and hook the other Well done and I like the bounce feature softens out the jolts Good strap well made comfortable,positive
Its not a very big capo like it looks in the picture and is sometimes hard to get on sometimes but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done the only problem I have with it is that I get the strings a little bent but that might just be me Pretty decent,positive
If you bought Rocksmith 2014 and use an electric guitar get this The cobalt strings are picked up very well by the magnetic pickups and in turn Rocksmith detects the strings A LOT better I had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up After getting these the game picks them all up now Rocksmith 2014,positive
My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings These harps have no volume Dont waste your money on them I guess the only thing worth having is the case but the case has no handles or carry strap52514 I said the case had no handle well I take that back There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside Just terrible,negative
You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this What a pain Oh well it was cheap enough to have around Just ok,neutral
In the past Ive always just guessed at how tight to make each lug on my drums This takes the guess work out of tuning your hides Each setting doesnt correspond to any particular octave but once you get the sound you want at least you know all of the lugs on that hide are pretty close to the same torque Its also easy to useB Pretty neat tool,positive
Windows 7 install worked fineI use Mixcraft Pro 6 and its working wellI did have an issue with the drivers since I had too many midi devices but the fix wasnt too hard does the job,positive
I just got this thing and have only learned the basics of looping Ive done two jams so far but I can already tell its an amazing tool for any serious guitarist The reviewer Shawn in PA hit the nail on the head with his comment that hes playing guitar twice as much and getting twice as good thats a great compliment on this pedal and I agree 100 What I especially like about this pedal is that it feels like it was the missing link in my collection of gear and brings it all together Im using my guitar my mixer my bass my drum machine my monitors whereas before just doing recording seemed like a bit of a chore this thing really puts the FUN back in playing I think this is the one piece of equipment that will really bring out my creativity and I cant wait to see what I come up with with my new band This brings it all together,positive
Arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar very easy to install but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument Guitar Strap Buttons that Rock,positive
First I bought a FM212DSP on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store That was my mistake I was looking for that Clean Fender Sound without paying the big bucksWell here it is friends in all its glory Tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want Tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp Young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price Its LOUD its clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it Add a Danelectro Distortion pedal of some sort off Amazon for distortion and youre home I own nine amps including Fender Crate and Peavey tube models and this is cleaner If you play CW look no further If you fingerpick this is your amp Electrified banjo mandolin or violin This is the ampBut if you follow the darker side keep looking THE definitive clean Fender sound for under 300,positive
I wanted a 12 string but did not want to spend a lot of money this guitar fits the bill The finish is much darker then the pictures online show GREAT SOUND from this bad boy This is a BIG GUITAR once I figured out how to tune the 12 string it really DOES NOT GO OUT OF TUNE After I few hours of play I retune it and its marginally out of tune I thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality while they are not grover tuners they get it doneThe downside for me is not the guitars fault this is an inexpensive guitar and a FANTASTIC entry into 12 string playing this Guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away but that is true of all guitars using this body type Now that I have had it awhile I would love for it to be acousticelectric but again for the price I was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action Im keeping it Bang for your Buck,positive
Really a remarkable microphone for around 100 Very sensitive its for studio not live performances Be sure to set your DAW insert on your input channel with a compressorlimiter as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping Has a rich warm tone like tube mics Compares to a Audio Tech 2020 not in the class of say an Audio Tech 4040 Cant beat it for the price Very good Quality mic for the price,positive
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American PBassnot good My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekendThe problem with the design is theres a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab thats screwed into the body unscrewing itself Weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenonWe are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero unscrewing forceWe tried to make the FenderShallers work but just could not Maybe were all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us Major Design Flaw,negative
It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isnt a Shure SM58 This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s I was considering the SM48 but the PG58 has slightly better specs and almost identical priceThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier It also has a different switch than the SM58 The metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical I tried both mikes one after the other first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar and then I changed the settings or more specifically the effects and the EQ on the PA I repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikesHeres what I noticed The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence They are about equal on volume The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal popI havent tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice as its too time consuming and interferes with playing Its difficulty to judge in those situations too or at least awkward but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58 but that could be just the settingsI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side The SM58 is a little flatter in response especially at the high end over 10K Hz and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58 somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz However since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz neither of these seems likely to have much effect although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singerI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity These mikes sound almost identical The B 2000 and the Shure SM The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued though and replaced with the 1800XM an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under 50I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup not even taken out for practice The model number is 333001 probably also discontinued This was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and toneI didnt have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment but I did reach some conclusionsThere is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard They ARE sturdy and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable at around 100 However there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable at lower prices including the Shure PG58 and most likely the SM48 though I didnt have any of those to testI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer Im giving this 4 stars only because I havent had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58 Unbiased review,positive
This tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that I cant plug into a tuner Banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practiceGreat product great price Great for acoustic instruments,positive
These are good if you have a few of guitars and got a favorite strap Buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts seems really sturdy and well made Ok if you got alot of axes and a fav strap,positive
Good strap very comfortable and strong Five Stars,positive
Joyo continues to surprise me This thing is all metal looks very sleek is true bypass and all around works wellThe individual bands actually light up which is pretty coolThe only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch You can see the led on nearly every other Joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look However it doesnt even show up in the product picture on amazon It wasnt a big deal I just drilled a little 1834ish hold and it fits through Almost perfect condition sounds fantastic,positive
The extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability Cord works well and hasnt been any problem to date Plugs directly to the system or my miniamp Works well XLR male to XLR female Microphone Cable 15 feet,positive
I like Dunlop products but The push down applicators Dunlops DabOMatic Applicator Tops are horrible idea One popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place I will not buy these again or I will remove them and just use a cloth Hate the pushdown bottle heads,neutral
First off the shipping was fantastic It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition It is an extremely well made and solid product I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a Starter Guitar Trust me when I say I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig It plays well and the sound INCREDIBLE It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp I cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good If youre thinking aout buying this guitar dont Just buy it BUY IT The best guitar I have ever owned,positive
I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps If you want the metal sound for practice then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill But with the hybrid amps Vibro Champ going for not much more you get better sounds and more settings I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding From now on its tube amps for me even if i have to pay the price A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well too Like i said for a first amp at one bill the Line 6 isnt too bad Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb Practice Amp,negative
This is the best invention since the wheel as far as Im concerned Its easy to clamp onto my guitar head and the frequencynot readings are quite accurate Its incredibly easy to use and very handy when restringing a guitar Love it,positive
this is one of the best mics in this price range It sounds incredible and at this price its unbeatable I only use three mics and this is my main vocal drum overhead and acoustic guitar mic although I use two mics on the guitar My other mics are a SM57 which is incredible and not crazy expensive and an AudioTechnica InstrumentVocal mic I love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks Incredible,positive
Yes The 10mm Tortex picks are BLUE I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multicolor pack If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop the Tortex Picks are all color codedAnyway Ive been playing guitar for about 15 years Ive been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14 At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on Teardrops were too small Fender brand were too slippery Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me The 10mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack dont feel too flimsy in my fingers I keep a tight grip and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market gator grips feel too porous for me Durability wise Ill lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out Blue Tortex are the picsk to go with,positive
I have just receive mine just now It was awesomeI never thought that it would be so solid It is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge Cant beat the price I would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand A Great Price Great Product,positive
This fender mini guitar stand works great It has cushin padding so my guitar is safe its small but stady All in allGood purchase Fender Mini Guitar Stand,positive
I didnt know what to expect given the price but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money I am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction For example the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed they work smoothly and firmly hold the strings in tune The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box the action didnt seem inordinately high but I couldnt resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so and now the guitar plays even better I might tinker some more at some point probably when it comes time to replace the strings but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this fullbodied dreadnought which is rich and resonant and very impressive I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price but the proof is indisputably before me Very nice for the money,positive
I love this guitar strap button Its a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink It works well for its stated purpose and appears to be of high quality The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close Noninvasive quality guitar strap button,positive
So ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now Ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that I noticed consistently so beware of thisOne channel 8 does 9v with 500mA sounds great rightI plug in my Even Tide Timefactor and works great by itself Once I added other pedals there became a horrible hum Like noticable and just horrible Then I used my stock Timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing 500mA from output 8 and there was no humThis phenomena also occured when I plugged in my Holy Grail pedal the classic one that draws 500mA as wellkind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp2 to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot Works great with one Caviaut,positive
this a great cable for practicing at home Coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles This product measures approx 28 coiled plug end to plug end Thus it is pretty short even when stretched out For me it is the perfect length for athome use especially when using two amp pedal board guitarnot sure why it isnt available for order on Amazon anymore I just ordered mine two weeks ago Great cable for home practice use,positive
I have a few tuners that are somewhat like this GT1 Clipon Tuner However this is the best one I have because of the format of the Clipon Tuner GT1 The size of the Clipon GT1 one is also great So far the tuner is very accurate in conclusion I would like to say that the Clipon GT1 is a good quality However I could have got this product for a lot cheaper The Tune,positive
Im starting a podcast I blindly lept to buy the blue yeti I can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this Great for voice overs In sound proof studios The sound quality was good but it picked up WAY TO MUCH ROOM NOISE The ability to select the 4 recording modes is great If youll use it I would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this However recording a choir or something would work But I will never do that and neither will you This microphone only has a usb port Not XLR So no hope of expanding If you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphonesOr you can do what I did and get 2 Audio Technica ATR 2100s 1 Behringer Xenyx 802 dual mic input Mixer 2 shock mountbroadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic standNow I can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcastDo not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever Great for one person without friends,negative

I have gotten comments on how cool it looks Im finding that I prefer a thicker strap but this strap works perfectly looks cool,positive
I got this from a direct from china vendor When it arrived the volume pot was not working It would only operate at about the first 14 of travel and then die off I was ready to give up but on the second day it just started working So I dont know if its a fair representation of these pedals I have two other fuzzsSwollen Pickle MXR 108 Classic Fuzz To me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed The Octave feature is a little useless for anything other than lead work and the midcut makes it a bit nasal sounding Dont get me wrong its a pretty cool pedal but its not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals But those pedals are about 100 so if you just want to play around with a fuzz pedal this might do the trick But do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon All in all I think if you really want a quality fuzz pedal you might be better off somewhere else I own a few other joyo pedals that I love but to me this one is just OK Not bad for the price,neutral
I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh Does it work Yes and no First it did not appear that anything was coming out After a bit of rubbing I did notice a 34slight34 bit of solution turns out its mineral oilon the fretboard by the frets I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless a paper towel would hold up better seriously I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar It says to use it before and after each session thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session I do still use this occasionally but I would not spend money to purchase it again Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner meh,neutral
I dont know if this is a common problem but i have these on both of my basses and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing like metal does before it rusts it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesnt just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose and one time the first time i didnt notice and it actually fell out Notice i still like the product this was just one of those things i think so I would still recommend it Almost perfect,positive
high quality hassle free design Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosnt mar the finish or use excessive force but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing Very happy with this purchase Awesome product Looks Great on my American Flag themed guitar,positive
Pretty simple tool did exactly what I needed it to for a decent price Id order again if I needed another one Great stringwinder,positive
This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and doubleleather ends The color stands out well on the black background Available in various colors Looks sharp,positive
First time for a soft wedgiepick that is I did have an older brother I used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great Very good price and looks like they will last awhileI highly recommend they for you to try if you dont like they you can give a fellow musian a 34soft wedgie34 which they just may like Great picks at a great price,positive
Some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit First of all I had to fumble around with it for almost 15 minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like I got a previouslyreturned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to manhandle it because I could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force I was about to give up but I felt bad to do the return because I didnt want to make Amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over 8 in postage to send back to themBut eventually I figured it out I am a 5 ft 10 inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because I opened it all the way and there was still an inch or 2 to spare if I wanted to raise it to the maximum Looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all 3 segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height They probably only raised 2 out of the 3 segmentsSo for the price I think you get what you pay for and since I just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under 18 years old I recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order And then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new oneThe truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care such as myself but not for children or drunks it is very fragile and easy to break I took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you overtighten so be very very carefulI will keep mine but if I had to purchase a second unit I would not buy this one because I dont like flimsy junk and I feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing Good enough for home usage,neutral
I works ok but you have to observe a few details when using itNotice the curve of the Mute and the curve of the top of the bridgeIt only is supposed to go on one way to match the shape of the bridgeTry reversing it and youll see what I meanAlso you have to press the mute down almost all the way to the top ofthe bridge otherwise it wont mute the sound very muchIf used correctly this mute works well It works but,positive
In my opinion DAddario is the standard by which all other strings are measured I keep trying different brands from the cheap to the boutique and I always keep coming back to DAddario Extremely versatile stable and they last as long as can be reasonably expected of any non coated string What can I say DAddarios rock,positive
Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok Will need to check them next week or so Seems good given the price,neutral
the product is great a lot of nice features i am running it through a little Cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion if you havethe amp overdriven then the loop comes out that way too and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellationTrying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what youre trying to play overGreat pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through best results with good amp,positive
This is a basic EQ pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing Even when running on battery power there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs Buzzy buz buzz,negative
This is the best little guitar pedal adapter Ive used and Ive used many over the last three decades Its exceptionally quiet which many are not and it puts out 96 volts which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery And you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hoursIve used this on a splitter to drive three pedals but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit Still thats a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers not a box on the floor But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay and a little extra gain driving the tubes and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of including the Boss ones Dan has released some cool wellmade pedals in the past 15 years and this little wall wart is a worthy companionA very good deal at 15 clams The perfect guitar pedal adapter,positive
So these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice Nonetheless I put a couple in just to compare them to my old plastic pins What a difference Unquestionably the sound board was far more sensitive Sustain was much better and I got a richer tone as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported I should say however what I got was definitely the true ebony wood pins with the inlay I cant speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors While these wont work due to size Ill definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when I find the right size Marked Improvement,positive
This one works it cant make me play any better wish it could but it wont make me play any worse Good cheap capo,positive
This capo is awesome it looks and feels very nice and premium it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for Nice Capo,positive
I had a BOSS Blues Driver pedal that I really liked that is until I got this Behringer Tube Overdrive For blues you or at least I want a gritty dirty sound one that implies some of the hurt implicit in blues music I was happy with the Boss but I decided to try this B pedal and Im glad I did I compared them sidebyside and the Tube Overdrive was much grittier like a small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit Its perfect for the sound I want and I can adjust the amount of distortion to my preference Some like a LOT of that sound but I prefer just enough to color the sound and shape it to my desires leaving the rest to my playing and the dynamics of how I attack the stringsIve now retired the Boss pedal In a careful comparison the Boss had a cleaner and slightly more clear sound which is not really an overdrive but more of a distortion but a clear distortion if that makes any sense It does add sustain but it cant compare with the B pedals effect which implies a power barely held in check just exactly what I was after GREAT tube sound,positive
The only complaint that I have is the instructions they are kind of shallow if you have musical theory background you should not have much trouble Im no expert I have a some knowledge beyond basic and its really helpfull to take some reference learning new things visualize quickly chords scales mayor and minor scales you can view there relationship its a great tool to learn if you have deep knowledge maybe you dont need it For complete begginers it might be difficult to start without reading and taking time to study This is a great complement to study theory Great item for learning,positive
Ive had two of these tuners They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners Theyre durable and have a long battery life Unlike most other tuners in noisy environments they dont lock in on higher pitches before lower ones again a plus for low instrument playersThe one problem that Ive had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A440 Strange Excellent but not perfect,positive
This is a great pedal I bought the extra footswitch to go with it it makes it alot easier to operate Does all I need it to do Wish it were stereo Stores 99 loops doubt Id ever in my lifetime need that many I havent tried the computer interface yet Love it,positive
This is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand It is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing Only thing make sure you read the description well It is a euro stand so it has 5827 threads It does not come with a mic clip When I ordered my mic from Behringer their clip had 38 standard threads which obviously would not attach I ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some Now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going Overall I would buy again Great stand for the money,positive
I never use it so I really only wasted my money I have rather high end guitars so placing any of them other than very securely is not a good way to go I suppose this is ok,neutral
Great strings I use Ernie Ball strings on all 7 of my guitars both acoustic and electric and never had a complaint I have experimented with others but always come back to them Love Ernie Ball strings,positive
I am a beginner and wanted a set that I can learn on but would also allow me to experiment with other percussion instruments besides a rock drum set and would take a small amount of room and allow low volume levels Ive had this set for about a month and a half So far it is working well for me The rubber drum and cymbal surfaces are great for keeping the volume low enough when playing late at night Each drum and cymbal seem to have sweet spots where I imaging the triggers are Depending on the devise hitting further from this sweet spot might change the sound andor volume produced The impression I get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another so it seems to be whether the problems are something you can live with or not Also you cant play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that I can enjoy it and feel like Im learning the drums It takes up very little space compared to an acoustic set which is great for me since I have little room for it There are a few problems that Im not likely to encounter until I become really accomplished One is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hihat or tom 1 simultaneously one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about half the time I found this out when playing these combinations rapidly which Im not likely to do maybe ever But it is still an error in functionality I called Alesis and they said this was a common characteristic of this model drum set There is a firmware update that has been mentioned in earlier reviews that I but it didnt make any difference In summary for the price and my needs I am very pleased with this drum set More expensive sets with more sounds and better nuance control dont have the rubber surfaces that I want plus according to reviews they all seem to have problems of some type so spending more money doesnt necessarily eliminate problems very good starter set,positive
I bought one of Snarks Super Tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised It will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less I am going to buy another so I have one in the studio and one on my stage rig Buy it Its a great little tuner Best tuner I own,positive
I have two of these stands the electric guitarbass version and the acoustic version Back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case Yes folded up it WILL fit in my tweed Fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar I DO always keep it IN the included stand bag to ensure I dont scratch or bump it against my guitar Great at this price too buy several works great and easy to carry,positive
If you want a little more 34meaty34 sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars this set is the ticketJust slightly heavier feel but much more toneAs usual after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension Perfect 1 for more tone from les pauls and copies,positive
If you are looking for a good quality inexpensive case this is a very good choice It has a durable feel to it It has a handle and a removable strap as well as a zippered slot on the outside for accessories It works very well Nice case,positive
I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews comparing prices I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power There are so many choices from the small portable units I was afraid they would sound like toys to the big units They would sound great but I couldnt afford them I am thrilled with the Starcaster This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image this is the one for you Little on price high on features,positive
I bought this pedal tried it out and returned it On the plus side it is quiet sturdy has a reasonable footprint does not suck tone and it is passive But the feel was not quite right for me Even with the adjustable tension I couldnt lock it in to where I wanted it Im very used to the Ernie Ball pedals and I also like the new Morley Volume PlusBut to be fair pedal tension is a pretty personal factor and this might easily be a 5 star product for you A fine pedal but not quite right for me,positive
This is a great effect Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products has always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable EQ is very sensitive and delivers as it should I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations Ships fast Highly recommended MXR 6 Band Graphic EQ Pedal Great effect,positive
A nice concept that actually works The cable is very nice too with an adequate gauge Try it out for yourself Good quality,positive
I agree with the others here this joyo is just a plain and simple OD just like so many others but at a fraction of the price I put my pedals through three tests 1 playing alone 2 Playing at rehearsal and 3 gigs This thing stands up nicely on all three Using it with Am Sp Tele Hiway 1 Strat Squier 51 Epi LP Spec wp90 and Fender BJ Peavey Classic 3050 Sounds amazing in any combo Giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth Yup,positive
This is my second Fender Polish Cloth They are basic but thats all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after Im done playing The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges Even though this has happened to me it didnt keep me from buying the second one The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me It gets softer with time and use Overall I have to say that Im satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth Great cloth to throw in your case or gig bag,positive
A value and a half If you need a beater this is it It plays great great fret job and solid tone Have recommended to several students This guitar pays better than some 3 times is value Great value,positive
Very nice quality of leather Its just a little bit short for my taste The guitar rested too high for my liking With some creative engineering I was able to get it to the length I needed Nice StrapJust a Bit Short,neutral
Leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee Saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis Nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat IIIII thooooought Wow almost like the opposite it is like a violin sound or mock reverse single delay sound Gotta love the slow moe Gotta love the slow moe,positive
Before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar stomp box or amp try this 95 of the time this will take care of the problem If your amp cuts in and out also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1434 jack in and out of the socket a dozen times The very first can I bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over Good stuff A Five Ounce Can Of Magic,positive
Easy to use from day one and I am a beginner at the guitar would recommend it to any one Easy to use,positive
I bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitarSince the peddle board is right in front of me the coiled nature of the cord keeps me from getting tangled upWhat surprised me was how it improved the sound I hadnt thought that a cable would do this but Ive since been told that Im not the only player that has noticed this phenomena Its beyond me how this works but I can hear the difference so Im changing over to all coiled cords Nice sound,positive
it is not that large and really organizes my instruments The only detriment is that I leave my instruments out and they tend to collect dust Cover them with a sheet or something Ease of picking which to play,positive
great price and helped out with recording to a Tascam 4 track cassette which I like using on occasion vs digital and just plain useful with so many other appsexcellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage fantastic,positive
This was for a friend who plays guitar He used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results Guitar Tuner,positive
Ok heres the dealIm just a small home studio type of guy and honestly I wasnt expecting much when I shelled out the 120 for this mic I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multipattern mic The first time I recorded with it I had it on omni mode and played some acousticit sounded amazing I cant believe this mic is that good Crisp clean sound who cares if its made in China like that one guy says and very flexible usage Ive since used it on toms acoustic a room mic for amps and even some background vocals and it has shined every timeSo if youre like me and looking for a lowprice LDC with multiple patterns GET THIS You wont be disappointed at all CAD m179 review,positive
They are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet I need to order a couple more packs though I swear by these cables,positive
I have been using Dadario strings for 30 years They sound great They stay in tune Excellent sustain I can get better string control compared to other strings I have never experienced a string break in 30 years The ultimate strings for any and all of my guitars If you buy one brand Dadario is a great choice for any style of playing,positive
This device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices Armed with a set of headphones I can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my MP3s mp3 player plugged in tooWorth the small price you payAs far as construction the battery door BARELY hangs on Im sure if I drop it even from a low height that doors flying off along with the battery Handy tool to keep from waking up the family,positive
UPDATE received 6 of these 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer It was held by only one small tac weldI got what i paid for cheap price and cheap product no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand putting a 500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart not worth the time to send it back to amazon One star only for this product Good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this Less than one star for this piece of LIGHTWEIGHTATTRACTIVE INEXPENSIVE,negative
I like this preamp I use one channel for microphone and the other for an electric guitar with good resultsIs very sadly and spendthrift that its useful life will be the duration of its tube another concept of produccioacuten nothing considered with consumer and planet I like this preamp but,neutral
I have checked this amp out twice once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 834 version with both a Strat and a Les Paul and I am very disappointed in this ampNow admittedly with the high output buckers on the les paul the preamp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 57 however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tonesSo without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointingBottom line unless you want full on distortion 100 of the time you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp if you are committed to Orange and boy do they make some stunning amps go check out the dark terror Severely overrated,negative
I couldnt be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it in fact this review will be the first so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback but Im glad I decided on this itemI wanted something with several storage compartments so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly This bag has six separate compartments for storage three main zipped compartments each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items Perfect I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled as well as a guitar strap that I dont currently require as I already have one but its nice to have a spare nowThe padding of the bag is quite thin but firm so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying The two built in backpack straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes toIf you are in the market for a guitar bag and dont want to spend a fortune I would definitely recommend you consider this item It is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too Exactly what I wanted,positive
I wanted to like this I really did The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think 34Perfect34 However the unit I received was crp and Im going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions The one I got kept cutting in and out You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75 of the notes or something And when holding a chord the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds FrustratingI did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit The soso sound and overall quality however didnt compel me to give it another go Bummer Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portabilityCheers Bummer,negative
Simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively Good value Low to the ground so balance is not an issue Simple Easy to Store,positive
This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unitIm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptableOver all I would not recommend this product Meh,negative
It does a good job for its primary purpose as a capo so I gave it four stars It works flawlessly but the one minor annoyance is that it doesnt easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar With clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood Good capo but the clamp tension products are a bit more convenient,positive
These are great patch cables especially for the price They dont suck any tone they are reliableIve had mine for 2 yearsand are really great for players on a budget Good Budget Cable,positive
This cable is built to last Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly What more could you ask for Great quality,positive
I love this cable they look good and are well made too An increiacuteble guitar cable i really recomended it i have the 12ft and this one 21ft Try one Monster Cable Standard 100,positive
I like the product a lot For me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effectIt is not so long as I thought I though it would be like the pianos sustainer But its a good pedal effect My guitar get a good sound with the attack effect Thank you Sustainer,positive
This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever I carry the case The only problem I have is it smells terrible But thats fine I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable Other than that this was a great investment Guitar fits like a glove,positive
I purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar This fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my Jackson dk2 Im using 3 springs right know and stays in tune no matter the abusethe only Con on this product is that they are noisy is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing very good springs stays in tune but noisy,positive
Ive needed one of these for my fender amp yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabillyblues numbers and if my settings got messed up well that would slow the show down I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didnt This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy Really quick to setup and use Its not a delay unit its not versatile either but what it does it does perfect A rockabilly no brainer great with fender amp,positive
The Tascam DP008EX is great I love this little box Its got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop Here are a few of the features that I really like about it1 Its portable and runs on 4AA batteries2 It has compression exciter deesser as well as EQ and Reverb3 It has a mastering section with effects4 You can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks5 It feels sturdy not that I would drop itjust to name a few I compared this against the Fostex MR8mkII which I also own and like The Tascam has more features for the buck as well it should as it just came out this year and the Fostex has been around a while As another reviewer put it this wont replace your DAW I can record some very polished songs on my laptop but the Tascam does come close The mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too I have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience The portability factor is huge in my opinion Being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs or vice versa is great Plus its fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areasI totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section FIVE STARS Excellent Tool for Songwriters Musicians,positive
There are other rack screws out there but Raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available As good as it gets,positive
I love being able to wind the strings pull bridge pins and cut excess string with one tool That frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff Seems solid and well built The perfect guitar tool,positive
I debated between picking up this and the Zoom H4N and went with the Tascam 8211 I just couldnt justify the extra 100 or so for the Zoom The unit is simple to use and the builtin microphones do a great job I picked it up because I wanted a portable unit that would let me use 18 inch 14 inch and XLR microphones with my DSLR or capture great audio on its own This accomplishes all of that 8211 although I need to use an adapter for 18 inch mics for the 14 inch ports 8211 there is no 18 inch mic port which seems an odd omissionThe unit is almost entirely plastic which can feel a bit inexpensive 8211 I know that one selling point of the H4N is its sturdy construction Still it seems well made and I think its a fantastic recorder for the price Easy to use excellent sound,positive
Great little tuner Easy to work with and also easy to find The price is also right and I recommend GREAT little tuner,positive
It is not a bad mic for the price If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio Now you need to decide what you want getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer speakers and so on If you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic This mic is quite good for its price I would probably say it exceeds your expectationsArrived as promised in a frustration free packing Also make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spitThe only reason I did not give 5 stars is mine had a little dent on the body may be due to transportation but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks Good product for the price,positive
Works solid looks solid and had a good price I would recommend it to anyoneI really like this pop filter Great,positive
Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because its a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing I can see the merits of screw on locks what with the ease of switching the locks but these work fine for me Have these on all my guitars,positive

Although the big push these days by SamsonZoom is on behalf of their latest entry the pintsized H1 the H2 is still outselling it Perhaps for good reason Amazons price has the H2 going for less than a 50 markup from the H1 yet only the H2 offers a sound stage as wide as 360 degrees and is almost as portable and easy to slip into a pocket as the H1 The latter offers the now popular XZ mic configuration but theyre fixed mics if you wanted to ensure the widest separation youd be unable to aim the mics in opposing directions Also the H2 can be set down on a flat surface more securely and is less sensitive to microphonics from touching any part of the machine Ive owned both machines and have found the construction quality wanting the SD door broke loose on the HD2 and the onoff switch came loose on the H1 Both are somewhat tricky to operate with settings that are not visible in dark places and which nonetheless require agile accurate and quick small fingers Some users are bound to react negatively to the minuscule size of the H1s microSDHC storage cards Both are capable of fullbodied full frequencied highfidelity audio but you have to remember to treat them gentlyThe Zoom Q3 video recorder strikes me as the best built of the bunch as its solid metal practically through and through and the limited settings make it easier to use than either the H1 or H2 However I found it impractical to use at a concert where where the included video component distracted the listeners behind me Also with its size and brightblue color its anything but a stealth machineThis brings us to the 4th and most expensive Zoom the H4n Its the most versatile of the Zooms not only permitting movement of the mics but the addition of external mics for authentic mixing Still the build quality is not notably superior to the H2 and of the 4 Zooms its the fussiest intended for a user whose willing to take some time to become familiar with its versatile learning curve After less than satisfying experiences with the first 3 Zooms I sent the H4n back in favor of the Sony PCM50 which is constructed like a Hummer compared to the plastic of the Zooms I see that Amazons description of the Sony is misleading since the PCM50 will NOT permit the user to record in MP3 format WAV is the only format it offers which simplifies the recording process allowing the user to select file size with the software program used during the editing process The only down side is the limited duration of WAV requiring the user to employ a Sony Sound Stick in addition to the builtin storage Zoom on over to the Sony PCM50 for a longterm investment,positive
I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts for iPhone which I like a lotProsThe clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover Marware AxisQuality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works wellConsIts too heavy for my mic stands I tried it on the boom arm and it made it topheavy and unstable If the boom is positioned in a very upright position its ok but a boom pointed up defeats the purposeThe clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersomeI had high hopes for this one but its not going to work for me I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model the one with the levertype mount Didnt work for me,negative

Fender Accessories 0733150406 Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings Custom are very goodI got it for my Strat guitar and they sound much better then Ernie Ball or DAddario at least on my tasteRecommend it Fender Accessories 0733150406 Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings Custom,positive
It wont slip It wont miss It wont a guitar break You can count on Planet Waves quality I like its simplicity and reliability Michael Haller Captain Souls Sound Circus Strapping Up,positive
I bought these as spares and they look really cool too I think everyone has used Fender Mediums at some point these are no different Reliable last a while and more important theyre inexpensive Medium Picksfrom Fender,positive
DI bass is the worst Just really really awful Every ordinary DI box Ive tried yields this thin cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light So when I started playing live weekly I just hauled my bass amp around to each gig because it was out of the question that I would rely on a weird sounding DI box to carry the dayI live in Phoenix I made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in 115 degree weather before I decided there had to be another wayWhen I first got this pedal I would run it parallel with the amp terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound After a few performances I let go and left the amp at home The Bass Attack pedal did not disappoint Ever since I just bring a bass and this pedal Running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound I dont miss the amp at allI did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived just tweaking knobs until it was perfect Youll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass and some of the settings I tried were less than ideal for my instrument But once I got it locked in Ive never touched the knobs again I just plug in and everything sounds magical Meet my new bass amp,positive
This is a nice microphone stand I have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems I would purchase this again Its sturdy and gets the job done Nice stand,positive
Cant say Ive tried all of the capos in the world but Ive had my share of the different designsFirst I had the bungee cord type then I had the snap on type then I had the different capos designed for acoustic or classical or electricalThis one by far evolved from good designThe bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly The top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings The spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tensionThe design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck All of the others I have tried use a spring that could pop out one actually did and the entire capo came apartThis one even has a pick holder built inIt is light weight just the right sizeI highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar Best capo Ive ever had,positive
It does know when your guitar is in tune Does it for you so you dont have to do it by ear Great,positive
If you own an American Strat or Tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize I love this It proudly states the guitars origin of Corona California with the Classic Fender name scribed Wonderful I have these on all three of my Fenders Again these should really come standard on all American Strats perfect fit and finish,positive
Id give this baby six stars if I could My prior practice amp a Vox was very nice but finally went south and required replacement I was looking for something with a great tube sound as most of the solidstate amps that Ive used mainly fenders and line6 stuff just dont get there I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check em out and listen sidebyside The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store I was blown away and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store Ive gotta say part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior but the Bugera actually sounded better The only one left in the store was the floor model so I grabbed itGot it home and cranked it up and here are my observations Its solid and heavy Its still a smallfry slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there but much heavier The construction is great I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction but from the handle to the floor everything looks like its built to last The sound is even better at home without the GC cacophony Adjustments are minimal but enough The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp Ive run my Strat Tele and Taylor T5 through this I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5 The headphones sound great I was really surprised by this I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones The price is selfexplanatory but thats really the part that blew me away This amp would sell for double the price tag Bugera V5 Five Watts Five Stars,positive
I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough I dont really enjoy changing strings but it needs done this tool makes it such a breeze I dont know how I ever went without it It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves Saves me tons of time and works perfectly,positive
Purchased this for my son who plays both Acoustic and Electric guitars Hes absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner Great buy prompt shipping great product Fender Accessories 0990521000 Slick String Cleaner,positive
These really do work great No more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now I do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my 5 monitors If anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know Thanks Works Great,positive

At this time I am using this switch on my Fender Frontman 25R to switch between the normaland drive channels The 90 deg jack is perfect for this and a lot of ampsas there are no dials in this area I have run into the 90 deg jack problem and the onlysolution I have found is to use a Mono to Stereo 14 inch gender changer or a short monoextension cable which is what I normally use as the stereo jack presents added problems as nobody makes a 14inch mono female to 14inch mono male gender changer which I have found to be more than a little strangeThis is a very old style switch that is made in China like everything else but works very wellfor this simple task I have 4 on hand Very simple Does the job,positive
Use very little of this Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off It also lubes your strings Good all around product Works,positive
Great for the price It is a very accesible option and does what it has to do Must have for solos Simple but great,positive
I love this pedal It gives just the right amount of crunch when needed Typical Behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound I use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern Nice and quiet when not in use and can scream when you need it to Highly recommended Great little pedal,positive
Im happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for Good deal Its okay,positive
When set on blink they blink way too fast When not set on blink all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white Useless design Terrible color mostly white dont waste your money,negative
I just thought I would throw in another 5 star review which is based on the cost vs quality factor I have several guitars and always thought Epiphone to be an inferior guitar Well I was dead wrong It may not have the price tag of my better guitars but it sure has the playability and sound Especially for the 100 tag on it Great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection The simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat I will not shy away from Epiphone anymore Dont make the mistake of not picking up this guitar only because its not stamped Gibson I agree,positive
This is a great invention I have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this It really saves on batteries and extension chords It is well worth the money Great for those of us with several effects pedals,positive
This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile Youll be able to hear them rattle It seems that the retro look is screw on connectors over some black rubber but other than that the cable looks cool and works wellI also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables Its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident The green cable is good for that Cheap and cool looking good length,positive
Nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesnt work Wellthats not the case here This power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configurationbut why go to all that trouble This product lives up to its calling Besides who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner Planet Waves when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget I gave it a 5star rating because the price is fair the product is well made and works and it was shipped well within the promised time By todays standards thats as good as it getsDP Works as advertised,positive
These are outstanding strings that sound great just a littler softer to my ears than the standard Martin strings They last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular noncoated strings Martin SP strings,positive
I have used Fender Thin 351 picks for 40 years but always in either solid black or swirl brown These picks are great because when you drop them on stage or in a dark club you can find them easily Easy to locate on the floor,positive
I hated having to put the pick between strings And now that I have a ton of picks I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish and I dont want to ruin it But the instructions say it should be fine I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well still deciding on that But for the price you pay for this its a no brainer for any musician Genious invention,positive
My new electric guitar isnt particularly comfortable to play while sitting so I needed a strap Ive played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable so I hoped to find a padded strap that didnt break the bank This strap fits the bill just fine Depending on the angle that your pegs are set however you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling If your pegs are set at an angle like on a Strat this strap will last forever If youre on a guitar with a horizontal peg like a LP youll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well This will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security The padding is OK but not great however its certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus A decent enough strap for the money,positive
its good but not fitting my requirement but its extremely recommend it for beginners because it is very easy to play and bend but for me as a reggae rhythm guitar its not good and not warm enough and i have one point on the G string specially if you want to lead and solo whenever you start bending you will notice how annoying its because its hard to keep in tune while bending if you used to medium G size Light and very triply sound,positive
I have the PT2 which is not backlit so I bought this one for use in dimlylit venues It worked great right out of the box put in the battery clipped it onto a standard acoustic guitar headstock turned it on and began tuning The display is big 114 X 114 bright even in a bright room and when the string is intune the backlit background turns from red to green like Christmas I put on a brand new set of strings and used it to bring each one up to pitch I found that plucking the string with your finger and then adjusting makes the tuner waver less probably because fewer overtones are being produced All of these type of tuners have some degree of hesitancy when reading the string pitch moreso on some of the strings than others but I found that this unit locked in on the signal quickly and gave a very accurate reading I can use a pick to pluck the string as well and this device after a very brief pause less than a 10th of a second gives me a reading or gives me the green I dont use any of the other features I also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrumentThe only other comment I have about it is that the on button should have been placed on the top of the unit as you clip it onto the headstock but I just mount the unit over towards one side and turn it on and off from the bottomI would highly recommend this for a anyone looking to quickly tuneup a guitar in a noisy dimlylit roomUpdateAugust 2012 Replaced the battery after 2 years with a good quality Sony lithium and the tuner is still going strong It works for me,positive
I bought this pedal used and have used it with both a Fender tube amp and a Marshall solid state using clean channels I can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collectionWhile I have several overdrive pedals this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end I can get decent tones from a Telecaster and Les Psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 oclock and adjusting the drive to tasteThe OD sounds great through Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar With some adjustment of the tone and drive knob the bass has an overdriven tone with a good driveThe other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic Boss in build quality I find the Boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones Ive owned after some time but I may keep this one as is and use it as a boost These pedals last forever and I only paid 20 for mine Good value and works well with solid state and valve amps,positive
It fits perfect on my MIM Stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back The Corona California on the back ads a nice touch when you compare it to the other Fender F neck plate Easy upgrade for a strat,positive
being new to guitar this is just way too much fun makes my playing acutally sound like I may know what I am doing easy to setup and easy to use foot switch,positive
Finally decided in getting the 100mm picks because I dont like them too thin or too thick this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for The logo will wear out in a few uses but I dont much about that Been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far its not wearing out too fast Recommended Great picks,positive
Dont get me wrongthis is a great little amp for practicingbut it eats batteries like they were candy I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries But if playing on the street corner is your thingthis little amp has a belt clip Stock up on batteries,neutral
You know when a good quality item arrives everything looks and works just as it is intended I love it nice,positive
I got this because at just around 32 bucks its pretty much seemed like a stealcompared to other pedals I was looking atBut a few notesIf you buy this definitely havebuy a 9v adapter with a polarityAlso know that when people said that little blue light was blinding wellthey werent kidding Ive put a little paper and tape over mine as well however it isnt stickingIt might not have the best effects or effect strength but as my amp has no built in effects its better than nothingIf youre cheap like me but want effects this is decent although the chorus effect seems particularly weak cheap and a few quirks but decent for beginners,positive
Im really happy with this pedal Give a good phase sounds like Waylon would use Simple to use one knob and it doesnt boost or reduce the signal good phase pedal,positive
Ive been using these strings for years Tried a bunch of others as well but these suckers keep coming out on top Probably will never stop buying them great strings,positive
I bought these to fill the Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder that I also purchasd Nice selectionand the price was right Super value,positive
I got this and it works well apart from the fact you have to really bang down on the keys Im hoping over time they will be easier to press Stiff Keys,positive
After reading all the great reviews I moved to these LightMedium strings from the light gauge They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge However I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy Finger slides are much harder with these strings The lower strings E A G just dont slide as easily until there is some buildup in them As a result my fingers get out of position and dont hit clear notes until Ive slid those areas a couple of times Thats probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them The packaging was also a bit confusing Since there are two strings to an envelope it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up Other string makers I have tried color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up Overall good strings and Ill probably buy them again Good strings but are they for me,positive
ever since I saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used Jazz 3 picks and after having tried them that he simply couldnt use an other pick I decided to try them out and I fell instantly in love with the regular jazz III picksI always had issues holding picks and keeping them 34put34 while i played and the jazz III was no exception so it didnt bother meMeaning I didnt really feel like there was a problem other than me being that problem Then I read about this new Ultex thingyit looked like a jazz III and every one seemed to like itsooo I figured why not have a go at it I was skeptical about this 34impossible to drop34 thing which I readso i was dieing to feel them Well they came i tried them and after playing for a while I didnt even notice that I hadnt once readjusted my pick NOT ONCE it was like there was no pick i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be it stays there to me thats just freaking incredible holy wow I love this thing love it love it Im surprized,positive
As a guitarist I lose and find picks everywhere I hate buying them because I know they are somewhere in my house but I just cant find them With this I take all my old credit cards student ID cards playing cards etc and make my own I now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me It rocks pun intendedBottom Line Every guitarist should have one No excuses Coolest Thing Ever,positive
Apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad I did Not an everyday product but when your strings still have their tone but have lost a bit of their glassy feel start to feel scratchy this is a quick fix until youre ready to restring Surprised,positive
As with any Daddario or planet waves product its always great quality and has great tone Ive used almost every brand of stings out there but I always come back to Daddario Great strings,positive
Bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome I was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most However once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on That was a pick,positive
This holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy It has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something such at the side of back of your instrument so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand I dont know exactly how many it holds and the thickness of the picks makes a difference but Ive crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues ,positive
When you are upgrading your Fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold Fender jack plate Necessary to a gold upgrade,positive
I personally use this in conjunction with my TU3 on the ground but honestly it just gets a read faster than the TU sometimes and its a fraction of the cost Really efficient way to go in my opinion I am a pit orchestra musician and Ive lent it to people who play LOTS of different instruments and it really tends to work well with all of them More reliable than a TU3,positive
For some reason this one just doesnt hit the notes right It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway I have tried it several times and it just doesnt tune right Then I recheck with my other brand and its not even close Maybe I just got a bad one I like that this one shuts off automaticallybut again its WAY off tuneI did like the style size and colorbut it doesnt work right so its like running with a flat tire I have another brand that works so much easier and works better,negative
Warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one When I looked at the picture it looked like there was only one but there is two and I didnt find it anywhere in the description Anyway it just lost one star for that I still put them on my guitar and it looks bad a Great Beautiful Tuners,positive
UPDATE 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning but MAN are they FLIMSYAll of my other musician friends who also LOVE this tuners ability to grab the right pitch also have employed copious amounts of super glue to reattach the neck and clip to the body of the tunerSo in short this is a mixed bag I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itselfSighIts such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimerIf SNARK fixes the problem I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating but until thenand I LOVE this tuner 25 stars rounded up to 3BooORIGINAL REVIEWI have had similar tuners in the past and by similar I mean clip onNearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading which translated into what felt like a game of keep away where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitchI am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners Not only that but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks if not moreSo I was skeptical But so many high reviews couldnt be wrong and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gambleReally glad I tried it outThe screen is clear and easy to read and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot No more chasing pitch for meHavent needed to use the vibration mic option yet but I am sure that will come in handy at some pointPlanning on getting another one for my other instruments as wellDefinitely recommended It really is accurate,neutral
I wasnt sure what to expect and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down especially when I took it from the plastic Very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnightBecause of the fumes I was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish I was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours I wouldnt leave it on anything finished for longer than that because this type of foam doesnt last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove For now its greatIt comes with a black nylon sort of mesh tube shaped bag good for putting it away or traveling For now I will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesnt curl so much For the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable Foam is foam but its still pretty useful,positive
I put this pickguard in a MIM White Blonde Stratocaster and guitar looks so great I didnt need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar Fender quality,positive
I am VERY satisfied with my hard shell Astyle mandolin case I received prompt delivery it was reasonably priced and a quality product thanks Happy as can be,positive
Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners It clips onto the guitar easily stays put and is not intrusive by weight or size The bars are easy to see and are accurate Very handy and accurate,positive
I replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar While these strings are a bit harder to play they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play they do sound great A lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar Sound great,positive
For years I played the original Cry baby the Vox Wah and others I cant remember names of I was always on a quest for a good wah sound that I just couldnt find I didnt want to spend 600 on a wah with a rack So at the recomendation of a studio engineer I purchased this wah about 5 years ago I am very pleased that I followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah I was looking for The greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable The user dials in the frequency sweep they want The volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix I recomend this wah pedal over all the others especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking Great Wah,positive
As a beginner playing guitar I was looking for something mid range and this is it It holds tune and has not failed yet Since I am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice As I get better I will upgradeSo far the only maintenance has been to tune it and clean the strings and that is normal Beginners choice,positive
I really like this tuner I have always liked the Planet Waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy This mini tuner takes all I like about the larger Planet Waves model and makes it ultra compact It fits nicely on smaller intstruments such as mandolin and any instrument with headstocks that dont readily accept the larger tuners banjo Telecaster etc I currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate Easy to read Easy to seeAnother winner from Planet Waves almost forgot to mention one other thing that is nice about this tuner is its stealth it can hide behind the headstock so you wont be concerned with it being always clipped on and it wont interfere with the look of your instrument Great Tuner for Banjo Mandolin Electric Guitar,positive
Ive use these strings for years I play often and like to change strings often I can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs They hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out Id highly recommend them Best strings for the money,positive
I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured Id change the back plate as well While nobody really sees the back it drives me nuts when the front and back dont match Because I didnt want to go without a back plate as some people like to do I picked this one up The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install You cant go wrong with genuine Fender parts Does what it should,positive
I ordered this product to use for personal recording and thoughtwhat could possibly go wrong I ordered it New and it definitely shows signs that it not new First the package was stapled thats right STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened Then to make matters worse there is a hole in one side of the fabric When I order something new I expect it to be new Based on this product alone I would not recommend buying from this seller Untruthful Seller,negative
Ill be honest the reason I got these strings is because of the cheap price Im a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only These seem fine to me Good tone and they stay in tune Great strings,positive
The Planet Waves TriAction Capo features a trigger action which makes it easy to put on and remove compared with any other style of capo Ive ever used As the product description says it has a builtin pick holder which certainly is not necessary but which is a feature that some users will find attractive If the photo on the Amazon product page looks confusing dont worry What looks like a spring actually is a spring The spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that visegrips work This capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes and narrow neck standard acoustic guitars as well as acoustics with wider necks eg Godins Seagull guitars The only quibble I haveand its a minor oneis that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments Once adjusted though the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz Versatile Capo,positive
This amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single 10 inch speaker It sounds great right out of the boxThe overdrive channels amp models are some of the best Ive heard from modelers pedals etc Not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and I havent even looked at the fuse software yetI am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes If you mic up this will work for small gigs The build seems very goodI dont think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price A very nice tube amp at a great price,positive
Its well made and is fine as straps go but the pick pocket isnt much use The picture implies that it hold the pick so that its partially exposed and easy to grab However the pocket is bigger that this and fairly loose so that picks tend to fall out when taking the strap off The pocket really doesnt work well,positive
While I wouldnt trust these to hold up my electric guitars I have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now The 1st one I used to try and hold my Dean From Hell guitar but it just mashed that foam around the yokes into nothing and didnt want it to damage my baby So I ended up using it to hang my Rock Band guitar This 2nd one Im using to hang up my Beats ProsI chose this product over some simple hook to hang my headphones is because of the foam covered yokes I figured if you spread the weight over 2 cushioned points instead of a single unprotected point of a hook that the head cushion would hold up better And the distance of the yokes means that the ear cushions wont ever touch the wallThis is a fantastic product if you understand its limitations I would recommend this for acoustic instruments any type of RBGH guitars and probably your lightercheapermostly plastic electric guitarsor even headphones that youd like to baby My 2nd One,positive
Small light and stays out of the way it just works Folds up if needed for travel I use with Stratacoustic There are many weird stands out there but this one works great and is a good price,positive
Recently I was building a Telecaster project A friend recommended using the 4 way switch instead of the stock 3 way switch This allows you to have the three positions normally found on a Telecaster bridge only bridge neck in parallel and neck only It also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in seriesThe result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge neck position and a slightly higher top end output This is clearly a case of 34your mileage may vary34 Ive been used to the traditional 3position switch on my other Telecasters Im a bit indifferent to this mod If I was building another guitar I would probably use this switch again It does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the 3way However I would not change out a working 3way switch for this For me the added benefit just isnt worth the effort Great for a modified Telecaster,positive
Pros They look very nice They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washersCons More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to shipId purchase these again but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled Better than the 2nd hand rack screws,positive
Nice cushion on both sides onstring and the back of the arm Stays very firm on the arm Itll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playingThe 4star is just to alert that it may be a problem for people with not so strong hands like kids as the spring is very tough Well built but requires some strong hands,positive
This microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my SM57s Its quite a bit stronger of a microphone also I am really impressed with this mic The only thing Id like to see is that it would come with a cover bag like the Shure mics do Other than that you save a heck of a lot of money for the same and even better quality Thanks a lot GLS Seems Better than Shure,positive
Ive been using a very cheap amp for too long and decided to try a tube amp This thing gave me chills the first time I played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after I unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first you wasted our money on this which turned to dang this thing sounds good guess its ok with me as I begin to shred on it with my p90 equipped les paulThe tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic and for 5 watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue though I dont think it is loud enough for a drummer It has line out and speaker out which is great and this amp has nice build quality Plus its on sale right now so snatch one before theyre all gone I would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device Note that this thing takes about 15 seconds to warm up so you cant just flip it on and play instantly not a huge deal just turn it on before you get situated I wish they could have crammed a 10 inch speaker in it though the 8 inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient So stop thinking about it and just go buy it This ones a keeper,positive
for musicians in a budget this is the deal it is not the best but it still does the jobnot very powerful to read the signal of strings in my acoustic guitar as it does the Boss tuner but for electric or bass is finevery accurate too just gettit if u are in a budget for the budget,positive
I have tried coated strings in the past including Elixirs and have never been very fond of them Whenever I tried them I felt a certain disconnect from my guitar Somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom Not that I hated them just didnt really love them These are the best ones Ive tried so far I still dont like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off If you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there After a dozen or so gigs with them they still sound the same as when I put them on Good for coated,positive
I owned a Boss graphic eq many years ago and never really took to it Ah the folly of youth First this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid The sliders have a nice feel to them as does the onoff switch If you have any tonal issues with your amp then a graphic eq is an easy solution No it wont make you love an amp you hate but if youre ALMOST THERE or even just want to add some sonic variety you wont really realize how useful and vital a graphic eq isMy rig right now is a strat and jazzmaster into a Pro Jr I love the amp but as the volume goes up the treble gets a bit piercing Ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal Its a subtle thing It takes some time to play around with the sliders and figure out what will really hit your amps sweet spot at least in my application where Im leaving it on all the time This pedal would also be good for a solo boost as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch throughOverall for this price you cant go wrong This is one of those pedals that has a million applications and will always have a use in my setup Im thinking of getting a second one and building a pedalboard specific to my acoustic rig comp eq chorus reverb You dont realize how much you need this pedal,positive
Hello I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty Im very satisfied with the quality of this case as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected WHAT YOU EXPECT FOR A CASE,positive
Had this for about 3 years now it works great and for 30 dollars it was a heck of a bargainThe construction is ok its plastic with a metal rubber bottom but seems sturdy Battery is easy to get in and out and comes with one but is not shipped connected to the terminalsSignal wise if on it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static which raises the noise floor by a hair The noise isnt noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off Besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hissWorks great in front for a clean or unclean boost but I tend to use it in the fx loop where it does what its supposed to do I think its a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup especially if the amps EQ isnt doing it for you or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal this thing fixes it allI would definitely choose this over more expensive EQs but I tend to take good care of my stuff Amazing Value,positive
These strings are what I use on all of my acoustic guitars The sound and tone are great and the price is right They shipped quickly and I will order again and again Great Strings,positive
I was using a Kyser capo until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldnt hold all the strings down I thought Id try something else out and settled on this one Its easy to take on and off Its tight enough The main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so I think it will fit even the widest fretboards I dont know about a 7 or 8 string though longer than a Kyser easy to use,positive
When I do my reviews I consider how well does the stompbox do what it does versus the price I give the MXR Custom Comp five stars because while it sounds nowhere near as good nor is as easy to use as a Keely you will pay substantially less On the other hand it sounds better than a Boss CS3 and is more versatile than an MXR Dyna Comp It is also cheaper than the MXR 76 Vintage Compressor which has no LED or AC adaptor So I think that the MXR Custom Comp is worth considering when shopping for a compressor You should watch demos on YouTube and many stores sell MXR so you can try one out If you want an inexpensive compressor with LED AC adaptor and a versatile sound palette then the MXR Custom Comp is pretty goodAnyone who argues that compression does not change your tone has not fully explored the potential of a compressor If you would like some evidence consider a song like The Fixx One Thing Leads to Another which was created in part by cranking a compressor up The manual gives three settings you might tryChicken Pickin New Wave Reggae and Chime Bloomeach of which sounds different The MXR Custom Comp can also give you volume boost if you wish to use it for that function and I think it does so wayyyyy better than the Boss CS3 which seems more apt at volume drop you have to crank it all the way to get a boostOne problem with this compressor is that there are four control knobs two on the exterior Output Sensitivity and two in the interior Attack Trim In order to set it as the manual suggests you will have to open up the case with a screwdriver and turn the two dials inside the box Because of that I just set it on New Wave Reggae for 80s sounds funk etc and manipulate the external controls as needed If I was playing country I would simply switch it to Chicken Pickin and leave it If you are playing multiple styles I would seek a different compressor like a 4knob KeelyA second problem with the MXR Custom Comp is noise If you crank the Output up it creates a buzz in my rig that can be taken care of with a noise gate The Dyna Comp does the same thing but I did not hear that as much on the Keely or Boss CS3I find that leaving the compressor on all the time sharpens my tone without taking it over but at the same time I can easily vary the Sensitivity to get different tonesustain It can give an awful lot of belllike sustain on clean sounds and works great with a chorus pedalBOTTOM LINE1 Nice compressor for the price especially if you want versatile sound palette good volume boost2 Hard to work with due to interior controls dumb3 Generates noisy signal when cranked4 Gives sound like MXR 76 Vintage Comp with less cost plus onoff LED AC adaptor at cheaper price5 Good compressor in its price range Keely is far superior in sound but you pay for it6 OK paint job doesnt really catch my eye Good Bargain for Compressor,positive
I bought this for my Taylor 714 It seems to keep things humidified very well I like the idea that it takes moisture out and puts moisture in as neededI have replaced packs twice I have not had any problems with the packages leaking or creating any problems in the guitars Love love love,positive
It has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance Yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space Great buy,positive
My favorite strings for about 3 years now i like the feel and the sound of this set I use this strings with an Ibanez RG Custom with Dimarzios Love it Ernie ball strings,positive
Not too much to say its made out of foam made to slip between the strings made to hold two picks I have several of these for acoustics and for electrics My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it wont be dislodged still it does stay on majority of the time I do recommend this My sons guitar teacher calls this a fancy little pick holder and Ive had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time One must also be careful my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off He lost it after performing in a play on stagePlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help Its a wedgie,positive
You know if you do guitar work you need a neck stand Some sheetsstand units cost 50 This was what I needed and it was cheap So far so good small inexpensive effective,positive
This boom has cleaned up my desk quite a bit and is great value for the priceperformance ratio I have an AT 4033 in it and it holds it in place with no problems Wish I would have known about it sooner Great Deal,positive
I bought this for a friend who always wanted to play violin but never could afford one the quality was surprisingly good considering how cheap it was I helped her set it up took 15 minutes max just needed to get the bridge just right and the only flaw I found was the horrible pegs that came with it I had some spare rosewood ones in a drawer which fixed that small problem as for the rest of the violin the furniture was workmanlike not concert quality but serviceable for a student the body was what really surprised me for a mass produced student model it has a nice sound I do believe that with nicer furniture a better bridge and strings I would not be ashamed to play this at a venue how it will hold up over time is a open question but from what I can see of its internals it is well put togetherthis brings me to my only real problem as she never has played any instrument at all she makes this violin squeal like a pig I am no good at teaching so I got her a few books and downloaded some vids from youtube for her to watch but stillHer husband has forbidden her to bring the violin home till she can play so she comes over here to practice which has led my neighbors to believe I am responsible for the sudden disappearance of several neighborhood cats I think the noise chased em away I am waiting for the call from the SPCA as I type this nice beginner kit however now the neighbors think I skin live cats,positive
This cable is an amazing find It simply works I am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them but the cable I received is perfectI plugged the cable into my Windows laptop waited 30 seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers and I was good to go I plugged in a dynamic microphone opened the Audacity software program hit record and it was amazing sound quality I had previously used a variety of input devices from a JamHub to a Behringer USB line input device to an Art audio preamp to even going lowbudget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the ThinkPad laptop This cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device I have usedThere are however a few limitations This cable is mono only ie not for stereo recording This seems obvious but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff This cable only works with Dynamic Microphones If your microphone is a Condenser microphone you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of phantom power source to power the condenser microphoneThe really good things This cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the Audacity software Some input devices are either very hot too much level or have hardly any gain at all so this cable works very well by providing just the right level This cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar acousticelectric guitar keyboard etc I have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them I was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record using just this cable and a Hosa wwwamazoncomgpproductB000WS1Q4E direct box I purchased from Amazon as well Plug and Play Simple For Most Microphones,positive
Simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end Appropiately priced Good value Not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a 90 guitar Arrived before projected delivery date The leather ends are VERY stiff and VERY difficult to use Takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar Works as designed,neutral
Pretty cool knockoff of the Schaller trem or Diaz Tremodillo This is my 2nd or 3rd Joyo pedal and my favorite thus far I dont care for the cheap jacks but you get what you pay for and I can always replace them if they break I work on pedals all the timeIve got a scratchbuilt improved EA Trem with two footswitchable speeds and a cheap little Danelectro Tuna Melt Other than the crummy bypass and plastic construction the Tuna Melt is my favorite since it has the hardsoft switch The improved EA has a great preamp for guaranteed unity gain or more and the footswitchable speeds that I added gives it extra flexibility But I think the Joyo trumps it by just a little bit in that the core trem sound is a nice blend of the Tuna Melts hard and soft settingsSo part of this is really a subjective take on this flavor of trem but suffice it to say if youve tried a few this one will probably satisfy you at least a bit No unity gain issues and the speed and depth have a good sweep throughout their rangesAnd its just a niggle but how hard would it be to get the word 34tremolo34 silkscreened so that its centered on the box At least theres no skull and flames like on the High Gain Distortion decent trem,positive
Hands down in my opinion these are by far the best guitar straps you can get I have a few of planet waves different designs for these all on my electrics I have an acousticelectric Ibanez but the strap wouldnt fit however the strap wasnt purchased for the acoustic I was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sakeIf youre considering buying this just do it These straps are the best of the best,positive
I bought these xlr cables for my mobile DJ rig and they perform flawlessly The contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality Buy with confidence High Quality without high price,positive
First time I tried to use it it broke in my hand It is now taped together while I wait for a different kind to replace it Broke in my hand,negative
I bought this using Prime and am happy with the power supply I have many different makes of power supplies In the end they are all the same Proof of this lies in the Boss unit I have owned for 20 yearsAmazon had the Planet Waves 9v supply for the lowest price lower than local retailers and if you do not use or need a 341 Spot34 this will not let you down I may order more to use with some of my older pedals not on my board Cheap power supply works as it should,positive
heres where you get those stringsI got 3 sets of strings on amazon for the local music store wanted for 1 set great strings,positive
Although not through Amazoncom I recently purchased a Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar I compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range as well as with the Seagull Entourage acousticelectric which was also in the general price range The S6 has a nicely consistent tone which although maybe a little too bright for some players tastes projects very well Some reviewers and guitarists with whom Ive talked wonder how Seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in North America for the price I think that I found part of the answer when I looked inside some of the Seagulls The braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars Looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it though youd never know I find the 18 neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and lefthand fingering Its a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width For me it works Some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar Seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width The slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale Gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering but not so short as to cause floppy strings I couldnt be happier with the Seagull S6 especially for the price Wonderful Guitar,positive
There a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today Sure some are said to be the best at this or that but for me the RAT is the one that does it all And at a great price to boot This pedal is not new to me Ive had a few of them in the past but the RAT 2 is just a great as the older vintage models Goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a Tube Screamer to a near fuzztone with some warm smooth creamy tones in between Remarkable No other distortion pedal can do it as well Ive been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them But the RAT delivers No joke It just does it all and wellThe Filter tone is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise That might thow a few folks off but its a little thing really The Filter is the core of its tone and the Distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion By going higher with the Distortion control the volume only goes up a little Thats great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit the volume wont go through the roof100 silent switching No hum No buzz And no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit Flawless comes to mind here Easy to set up Strong as a Tiger tank And just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with And the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the RATs of the past Kinda cool if you ask meIf one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues get yourself a RAT If you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a booteek pedal that sits in the RATs shadow buy that high dollar unit and you can at least Look Good while you play But your tone will still stink Its up to you Me Its a no brainer I go with the RAT The best Ive ever used Period,positive
I have been using this tester for about a year to test out my XLR cables and those that I come into contact with at work It works but does not detect all faults only non intermittent ones it comes in a durable enough housing and is compact enough to take everywhere Inexpensive decent quality durable,positive
I like these strings I have had nothing but problems with Ernie Ball strings especially the higher ones unravelling at the ball ends and breaking as you are tuning up for the first time after a change I have also found that the Ernie Balls break easily as well I have had no problems with these they sound good feel good and they are priced right Better Than Ernie Balls,positive
Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try For the money I figured why notGREAT little tuner Dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners This clips to the headstock and is very easy to useThe face pivots around and the display is nice and bright I will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases Nicely Priced Accurate Handy Tuner,positive
I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument Cheap 50100 instruments do not play accurately and you would be more likely give up This on the other hand is NOT a lowquality instrument Takamine makes many excellent instruments this included It plays very loud and clear zero buzzing If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else look no further I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price Note the package does not include a gig back or case So I bought this one here that fits the guitar perfectlyMusicians Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black Black Look no further,positive
Works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks Id use it for lightweight guitars Using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder I always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage This strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage works well better than straplocks,positive
Well like everyone knows this is the copy of the Boss but a lot cheaper than that It works just fine and im happy with it Anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal If you want more from a pedal the Boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance Very Nice,positive
This was my first strap It looks good feels pretty strong and it is difficult to strap to the guitar By being difficult I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons and it holds on tight This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground You cant beat the price either Solid Strap,positive
I do like this pick I bought a few different types to have a variety to 34Pick34 from A suggestion from my teacher Good suggestion depending on what kind of guitar Im playing on it changes the tone I like this one Good pick,positive
I used this tuner as I transitioned from playing Rocksmith to playing in the real world My amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings With this tuner it doesnt matter if it is electric or acoustic it gives a very very accurate reading My luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it they were only off by 2 units in any given direction Very happy and pleased with this one This beats the pants off of any built in tuner and colorful display is easy to read in sunlight,positive
If looking for that oriental sound this is it Nicely made Some folks expect something different I suspect It is not a cymbal that you use like a crash or ride it is more like a splash and at that it is for use for a particular sound Highly recommend And when I bought it was very well priced like half what I could find used and this was NEW Great Cymbal,positive
This micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one And it is NOT a toy Dont be misled by the pricethis is a real amp based on stompbox electronics and while it may not be a Marshall stack it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces It is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartmentsI bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice To this end I use the belt clip to mount it on my hip Then I just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town The tone has been fairly pure although with a mike at least I can also get some pops crackles and squeals This is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp so the Honey Tone is not at fault In general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input Ive used it with a highimpedance mike Astatic JT30 a lowimpedance mike Behringer XM8500 and electric guitar Fender Stratocaster It handles these without noticeable signal lossWhat is this amp exactly My guess is that Danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox added a 1watt amplifier circuit and put the whole shebang into a retro case The result is quite appealing And the overall look and feel is one of quality The case is solid albeit plastic The three controls volume tone and overdrive while not detented have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components The input 14inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid Someone in Danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the units leather strap though It is more decorative than usefulIf you can operate an overdrive stompbox then you know how to work this amp The volume control is obvious The tone control alters the basstreble mix but not very significantly in my opinion The overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree The instructions describe 16 sounds but someone in Danelectric has a sense of humor Otherwise why label one setting Send the cats under the bed Ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to youAs I said this is small but really not a toy Ive personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because its so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable And when I decide that Im good enough to panhandle in Penn Station this baby is going with me An amp for panhandling in Penn Statin,positive
I bought 2 of these and will order a few more They are very nice looking and functional too I have been keeping my guitars in floor stands or in their cases but it takes up much needed space and just creates clutternot that a guitar should EVER be considered clutterThe GREAT thing about these is that your guitars are always 34right there34 and you can choose whichever one you have a hankering to play at that momentJust a note of caution though Make CERTAIN that you mount the hanger screwed into a stud or on a solid wood surface The weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock Included are sheet rock plastic backers but personally I would not trust them and nobody wants a hole in their wall I would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well Im sure the screws are okay but I wouldnt trust them myselfI would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many Well worth the small price paid The shipping was incredibly fast too as always with Amazon very nice quality and price is right,positive
I have an Alvarez Yari acoustic guitar that I absolutely love but I have wanted missed a warmer tone the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and I had always assumed that I would never be able to get the tone I wanted in the low end as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar for exampleThen a friend recommended I try these strings and to my mind my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformationHere is the gorgeous tone I had missedI am now on my second set of strings and I am hookedOne thing I have heard that these strings arent as durable as other stringsHowever this hasnt bothered me as tend to fingerpick and soft strum and so this possibility hasnt become an issue for meAnd while I would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience I did I would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in toneThe fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try Thumbs up Wow These strings sound amazing,positive
Eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion worked perfectly out of the box and has been used several times to record choirs and piano The sound is clear and wellbalanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around 10 feet Simple to Use,positive
Price is Right for entry level Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings The Mic mount was a PLUS using it for one Karaoke Cheap Mics It is just popriveted on so a Bit LOOSE but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy Only thing keeping it from 5 stars Still for the money a great buy Excellent value light weight but compact,positive
By now you have probably read about the problem with the USB connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the USB functionality unusable an Amazon reviewer referred to this as a fatal flaw and I heartily agree I experienced this firsthand then read folks struggling with the issue on the Mackie support blogs When I called Mackie support to seek a fix I was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware They sent me a new Mackie Board from the newer lots and I returned my old one I have not had any problems with the USB functionality since I am thankful to Mackie for the great customer service especially since I addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expiredIm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem but if it does contact Mackie to get a replacementAt this point I am still running the board through its paces but thus far so good Mackie fixed the fatal flaw for me and all works well now,positive
Great product Easy to use and I was able to shield my entire Jazz Bass It would have been nice to get a little more of it though since this was JUST enough Good product not enough,neutral
It a simple holder that its really good to make sure that you will not be out of picks when you need then Good,positive
I replaced the metric pots in my Greco LP and needed new top hats These look great and work perfectly Perfect Gibson knobs,positive
I have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes This works very well for all of them Its very easy to take on and off and it stays right where you put it The rubber is tough but molds to the instrument I havent seen and marks or damage from using it Works well for all my stringed instruments,positive
No matter the weight selections Ive found the Ernie Ball Slinky series a worthy pairing for my acoustics Theyyre responsive and twangy Slinkies are my goto,positive
This cable is great for XLR microphones or DIboxes They are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality ships as expected,positive
This little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you I tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesnt Im not complaining about it but I think it would be a nice extraGreat buy Does its job its practical and looks good,positive
This pedal in short sucks Theres no point to having an AB pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound Behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this Hiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssss,negative
I use this in my recording studio to allow musicians their own level of monitoring in their headphones for recording and playback So far Ive had this item for about a week and it has worked flawlessly and given the exact results I needed Musicians love being able to control their own headphones rather than having the engineer in the control room raise and lower their levels Perfect for in studio applications,positive
One for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great I probably didnt need the 15 length but at the time this was the only really good cable with 90 angles Bought two,positive
For what its supposed to do it works very well I also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better I think This is still usable but it is for very big fingers I think I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there but this still leaves some extra room Either way it works well It feels very sturdy and Im not worried about it cracking anytime soon For the price its a must have Decent Slide,positive
good if you dont want to have to drill your guitar for a stud mount its nice and does its job sometimes gets in the way of the strings or might stop a tone but it ultimately works nice for what it is,positive
I used to use Elixir Nano string and a good as they sound they do not last These do great sounding strings Excellent,positive
Hosa products are a good bang for the buck I havent looked up the specifications but Im guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG but since its only 10 long its good enough Good Enough,positive
I have a couple of clip on mics that I tried out This one is definitely the best I use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke You do have to find the sweet spot but once you do it works great through my Pignose amp and actually fits right inside my Pignose Great value and price too Works on ukes,positive
What a nice product Rugged and well made The supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigsI was able to build a pedal board with a tuner delay distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare It looks very neat and tidy Using George Ls makes it look even betterI will buy one of these again These things rock EDIT 10252012 Still a great little board but I found Power Grip Pedal Board Velcro this board that the new velcro make this an unstopable unit Perfect little board,positive
This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume The pickup is very over sensitiveAlso spend some time where exactly you place the pickup it makes a big difference Try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something Pickup good lower bad higher volumes,neutral
I purchased several of thes Fender Mini stands because I dont have a lot of sapce for my guitars and I fold these up and stick them in my closet when need I dont need themFor approx ten bucks you cant go wrong They work as well as bulkier more expensive stands inexpensive and portable,positive
I use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations Pickups on the flyand then if it sounds OK go to the big boys in my blues roomThe amp will reach its max in short order but again for what it is and the price it ishard to find an equal Ok for what it is,positive
So these are pretty great strings Not much to say The price is really good About ten dollars a set which is really good Two sets in one,positive
I love this stomp box although I never stomp on it Needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you My amplifier doesnt have reverb so I route the effects send to it and leave it on It has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldnt think about playing without it Part of my tone,positive
Not the greatest cord I have ever used not the worst either I would prefer Fender Tweed cables over this one if I had to make a recommendation Ok,neutral
I bought a set of these from Amazons warehouse deals page with a discount because of some expected damage They showed up in pretty good shape though to my surpriseI was expecting some damage to the items but hoping that between the 2 of them that i would be able to salvage enough to put together one full stand I bought these because I needed ONLY 1 stand with good height on it for mounting my 32 LCD Hitachi Flat screen to it I use this TV in my studio so that everyone can see whats going on when we record and work on music I needed something that was going to be sturdy and hold the TV high enough that everyone in the studio would be able to see it all the timeBoth stands showed up in good and working condition They go up to about 8 tall and are perfect for mounting speakers onto although I use it to mount my TV about ceiling height which is about the same weight as my speakers if not more They work GREAT Im going to add some pictures of my creation when i get around to it give me about a month Good Product Great height,positive
Use it with an SM58 Shure mic in a studio type application Holds up great Mic does not slip Upside down sideways Works great,positive
Sturdy portable and the little extra weight is worth the investment if you ever want to put a music book rather than single sheet music on your stand Those flimsy backless music stands are worthless IMO especially on a breezy evening My bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors I guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag Great stand for the price,positive
This is a simple and cheap way to hook your pedals together on your board I have bought 2 packs of these and have only had one go bad on me note that they are cheap and are NOT the quality of say George Ls cables That being said they also dont cost 70 Can I hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones Not really People who say they hear tonal loss with some cords are scrutinizing the imagined auditory experience Why only four stars because I wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors it does look dorky on your board to have a bunch of different colored cords but thats my opinion Perfektion is cool,positive
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks It does exactly what it says it does its also very cheap very nice,positive
I bought this for my sons 7th birthday He badly needed an upgrade from his Ludwig Jr Kits bass pedal This is a great pedal for younger kids or people learning the double bass for the first time Seems a little slow but as I said for my 7 year old it is perfect Seems well build but for pros or the gigging musician you may want to save up some change and buy a better pedal 5 stars because of the price and what I was expecting to get I wasnt expecting pro level gear for a sub 100 pedal Perfect for what I needed it for,positive
I have multiple guitars for different styles I use these strings on my Ovation Legend for acoustic leads Good tone good sustain and they stay in tune I play 2 gigs a week on average and practice everyday These strings get a workout and I change strings when I start to lose sustain Thats why I buy the 10 packs so I always have spare sets on hand Favorite brand of guitar strings,positive
I had been having lots of trouble with my guitars falling from the leather ended straps Not any more These locking ends are the ticket They are quick to release and adjust and fit very well They are bulky when putting the guitar in a case but I just leave them on The strap itself is plain but it highlights the beauty of my guitar Its a must for any rambunctious guitar player Guitar security,positive
This microphone works well for our needs I purchased refurbished so when I received the microphone the mic piece is actually removed from the handle It could be from shipping I reattached the item and added a windscreen Now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore Good quality product for Karaoke use,positive
this is very inexpensive and works great for my homewanna be purposes it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc but it definitely gives you the effect it links well with other pedals the Battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a 9 v plug in therefore I would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard 9V plug in on Amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going deadI like it enough that I will probably get a few more of this companys petals as the effect is good and the price is rightfor my limited purposes this works great if you are a pro gigging or on the road you probably want to get a more versitile heavy duty and expensive delay petal for the price works very well,positive
These cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable I wish Id gotten one longer than 5 feet though since I can only play close to my amp with two five footers Oh well Obvious quality,positive
For what it does and how I use it this is the hot setup Great for a quick practice and really sounds nice Wide overdrive and tone range The delay feature is basically a simple slapback echo Id much rather have a chorus in there but for price and the sound Im quite pleased Very Nice,positive
Heres the deal with this pedal It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money In my opinion for spending less than 100 for a distortion pedal whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it Beginners Beware,negative
This mixer is just what Ive been looking for The 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects This mixer is a little too much for me considering that I only record with one XLR track use the outputs for my UCA202 Interface but its good to have these extra inputs just in case I want to stretch my 34creativity34 Anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price Anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one Guaranteed amazingness First mixer 1 word Amazing,positive
First off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable Turning the knobs on the pedal reveals the the smooth and efficient quality of the pods The pedal 34gets along34 fine with no interference with the other pedals on my board The sound is exceptional and can be adjusted within a wide range to ones liking I cant say its my favorite pedal but it sure does play a nice role on my pedal board of various effects Great little pedal,positive
Ive bought three of these now this is an awesome well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily The most recent was for something rather unique a fanned fret compound scale eight string and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spareThere are more expensive options out there but for a nonfitted do it all case this is the best bang for your buck hands down I am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs Great case great price Fantastic case for a great price,positive
I was expecting something a little bigger It will do but next time I probably will look for something with a little more stability A little small,neutral
Put away your effects pedals modellers and software for awhile and get back to the earth or at least the simple appreciation of what an electric guitar sound can be straight off the axe with nothing but pickups volume and tone pots to shape itFor me the classic PignoseandaStrat sound is the opening of I Looked Away from Layla but Im sure everyones got their favoritesLoud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of naturalsounding distorted tones Stick an SM57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking its a tube amp By working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound along with that barely breaking up holy grail of tone for many blues and rock playersBy learning how much you can do with relatively little youll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the toneshaping tools that have come along sinceIt might surprise those who take todays hypersaturated overprocessed metal distortion for granted as the official communitysanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustainOne bit of weirdness When I began playing my Pignose I immediately noticed a buzz as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill The four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and sure enough an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly Fortunately it slid right out and there was no damageGet the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choiceThe first amp I ever had was a small Ampeg tube from the early 60s with a single 6 inch speaker volume and tone knobs Ive no idea how many watts it put out not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door With that baby cranked I spent many happy hours in tone heaven All these years and amps later I guess Ive always been searching for that sound and the Pignose comes closer than any tube distortion blues overdrive pedal or ratty box Ive triedFor the money you cant beat it Thoreau Would Love It,positive
these dunlop straploks are amazing never had them fail on me and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home they stay secure when done properly Ive looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work and work well save your axe,positive
Their are two issues with these straplocks that I have come acrossThe first issue is with thick straps I purchased a nice leather Levis strap which I love but their didnt seem to be enough threads on the lock to fit the strap on I managed to get it to work by thinning the leather of the strap with a vise Overall it wasnt a huge issue just a bit annoyingThe second issue is actually a very concerning to me Both of my guitars have begun to randomly unclip themselves from the straps and fallen to the ground Not good I think it has something to do with the metal on the locks getting either bent or worn down whatever it is I dont like having my guitars fall to the floorI have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy Its the first thing I do when I purchase an instrument Theyre pretty easy to put on the strap and guitar and they do securely hold the instrument in place mostly Ive had them on one of my guitars for over ten years and on the other for over fiveI probably wont change to a different set of locks for fear of stripping the holes on my guitars but my next guitar will be getting some Dunlop straplocks qid1357264576sr81keywordsstraplockwhich seem a lot better and more sturdy Perfection,positive
Not really bright enough Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same I would look for something else if I didnt already have this OK for reading a small book in bed but doesnt cover the sheet music brightly enough Not very bright,negative
This is a great bag regardless of cost The fact that it sells for less than 20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal Free shipping only makes it that much better Unlike some other reviewers I have not noticed any objectionable smell I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your solid body guitar some very substantial protection I would estimate the padding which is entirely concealed within the cordura to be approximately threequarters of an inch thick In addition to the main carry handle at the side there is another in back at the top as well a pair of backpackstyle straps so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldnt be any kind of an issue The two zippered accessory pouches for picks a spare set of strings and perhaps some music are also a nice touch In my opinion this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain As it is its very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II Great Bag,positive
I used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome It was easy to install and the finish was perfect Looks Good,positive
I own the old Ibanez TS9 that I modified to the original Keeley specs Side by side there is a difference but I only use it for my rehearsal rig This is the first pedal Ive had to actually read the manual in order to figure out how to install the battery The instructions tell you to use a ball point pen to press in the hinge pins in order to remove the foot switch cover I laugh when ever I hear about the 34Holy Grail34 4558 IC Chip When I modified my TS9 I found that Chip at Mouser for 15 cents a piece It was a net order and I felt weird ordering 1 so I ordered 5 They send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase The Behringer TO 800 is a cheap alternative to the original if youre on a budget and will do in a pinch The civilians wont notice the difference Good for the,neutral
Wall hangers are good spacesaving ideas but Im one of those who thinks they can stress necks depending on the bodyneck weight distribution and balance I made my own hanging bases just a carved slab of wood really to support the instrument from the bottom The top hanger now just serves as a rest but depending on the guitars balance Id recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if theres any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward Does the job but use a base support to protect the neck,positive
This holder grips the IPad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue The rotation to vertical is good but it would be nice if it went both left or right Because the arms dont collapse its a bit bulky to transport in a gear bag but its positive clamping offsets that issue Ive seen some with folding arms that have dropped IPads suddenly because something came loose Where I fell down was not ordering the K and M clamp arm that comes as a package under a different order number Ive since seen that arm in use and it would improve the versatility of this unit though the package is pretty spendy I could not order that arm separately I mounted this holder onto a short mic stand by using two mic stand quick releases one for the holder and one for the mic stand boom arm Then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag Good Positive IPad Holder,positive
I love this product I t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast so y dont have to life it over your head Well worth the price Revies,positive
good cable doesnt tangle very good ends great XLR cable,positive
The pots on my bass has become 34scratchy34 so I sprayed a bit into them turn the pots back and forth a few times and no more noise Great for what I needed Cleaned the pots on my bass just fine,positive
This brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing This is not a deep cleaning dust or dirt removal brush it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by Last LAST PC Power Cleaner 34 OzThe brush is super simple to use with the album on your turntable hold it at roughly a ninety degree angle for about two revolutions and then sweep it off the LP No fuss no muss no fooling around Never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers When there is visible dust on the fibers give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers After each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers If you press the brush too hard against the album or do the deep dive sharp angle trick fibers will be broken off the brush Just press lightly against the rotating LP sweep the brush off the LP and all will be wonderful with this brushThis brush is sold under many different brand names ClearAudio AudioQuest and ThorensThe brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission Maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use instructions would be redundantAudiophile or not this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings Pure Pleasure,positive
Liked the sound the adjustability just wish I could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way I find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid I dont care about disturbing the neighbours but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling the Rumble 75 is a bit big to take everywhere I made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must Oh for better eye sight,positive
This simple tool helps protect my guitar from scratches when Im changing strings or just cleaning it up Its a foam cushion with a neck supporter It rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage Well worth it Care and Repair Mat,positive
Hey its a pick its 10 to a bagI lost one already so now I have 9 I my world thats good stuff Why not,positive
Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar DAddario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the ElixirsThese are very nice bright strings The coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings I like that Compared to Elixirs these are a bit brighter with good feelCall me old school I hate the packaging These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag Ah you know Im just so used to strings that are individually looped Two strings looped together makes a mess while Im restringing a guitar when I unwrap that pair Ive got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench The neat freak in me hates that I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag Yeah I get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible But darn it 6 paper envelopes It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials not some environmental cause 100 postconsumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental loadI know DAddario loves the color coded ends On my acoustic guitar thats irrelevant the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs On my electric guitars I dont like the look at all I prefer gold or silver rings at the end If the strings are in individual labeled packages theres no need for the colorsDAddario loves the color coded end rings so much they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging I have yet to decode their colors or naming systemI normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them The slightly thicker string is not badOddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixirs My reason for using the original DAddario strings is low price if somebody is doing gigs nightly those uncoated strings are the only way to go Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician For the home enthusiast coated strings make a ton of sense they do last longer I think they are worth the premium price Now there are two choices for excellent coated stringsIn the end the packaging the color coded end rings the crazy package coding and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar What they sound like and play like is the most important thing And in that regard these are excellent strings Excellent Strings,positive
bought these for my Squire Strat I was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips these nobs fit great and look great I would difenantly recomend them great look and fit,positive
These are niceand this was easily the best price around These are made in Japan and I believe theyre made for Fender by Gotoh so theyre good quality But I was annoyed that they the bushings didnt fit the standardvintagesized 340 holes in my Allparts neck theyre a little largeSo be aware of that Fender vintage tuners,neutral
its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back its not bad,neutral
Sounds decent and stays in tune For the price this is just what you need if you want to dabble inon the violin For the money it is worth it,positive
I have a real problem with these patch cables I got them as a christmas gift but they dont stay in my pedals input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion Most problematic is the connection between my EHX memory boy and digital memory man never had problems with any other cables here but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust Dont stay in my pedals,negative
This is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely thick and durable made of awesome material buy it Not fancy but its made to last forever,positive
The only negative to this well made capo is I wish the tension was slightly less I find that once placed notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure It will work out just fine though and I will just have to make a few adjustments in tuning to correct for this Good quality at a good price,positive
This is a excellent Snare Wire used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old Pearl Snare Drum quick and easy to replace came with straps to secure but did not use them as I prefer string Improved the snare sound by 100 no more rattle snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound well made product that did the trick Product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect Great Product at a excellent price Excellent Product,positive
They fit fine Works as described lol Comes with the screws and the 34cotton34 washers so you dont scratch the body Coool,positive
I wasnt expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner I have to say it is one good funny lookingclip on tuner Many useful functions I especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything Like the capo and metronome feature I just really like this little guy Good job Snark Snark SN1 Tuner,positive
I purchased two Fender instruments a mandolin and an acoustic guitar each of which came with a Fender clampon tuner with similar functionality but I thought to give the Snark a try I havent used the sound versus vibration mode much nor have I done much with the metronome function muchI cant speak to them however I am very pleased with the vibration tuning Compared to the Fender both will get your strings tuned well what I like better about the Snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers With the Fender I feel I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again and that adds up when moving from string to string The Snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag the tradeoff is any easytoread display Lately its become my goto tuner Nice,positive
My banjo arrived a couple days after I ordered it It tuned up very easily and for me it holds tune nicely It has a good ring to it So far I have only had to replace one string but that was most probably due to inadvertently letting it sit in front of a forced air heating vent Very nice banjo,positive
works great pretty simply to swap out the old springs for the new ones Id say there was a slightly more smooth feel now when I use the whammy bar works great,positive
I like these strings for their warm mellow tone They are easy on the fingers and I prefer the silverwound basses Smooth Silky,positive
I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics No more winding string wraps around the tuning post Fastest string change ever Insert string wind about a half turn and the string is locked in the tuner No more slipping out of tune Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do Perfect,positive
I dont play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as Hardwire HT6 Polytune or Korg Pitchblack I researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner I narrowed it down to 3 Korg AW2 Snark SN1 Intelli IMT900 All 3 have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under 20 I visited each manufacturers website for more information and found out about the Snark SN8 Snark claims that its their best tuner yet If their SN1 can go toe to toe with the others then I would assume that their best will do even better I took the plunge and ordered one I have only 2 requirements for a tuner1 It should be accurate2 It should be fastThe Snark SN8 delivered on both counts and more It came with other extras like tap tempo metronome super tight tuning pitch calibration transpose features etc I may not have any use for all of them right now but its nice to have them at your fingertips You can use it for other instruments as well but I only use it for my guitars The SN8 is small unobtrusive The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like After tuning I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case I dont like it hanging in my guitar Of course it doesnt stay long because it tunes fast For under 20 these little tuner is all you needfast and accurate Try it you wont be disappointed Inexpensive Gem,positive
Hi I thought these pots would come without the proper caps its not on the description of the product and they did so Im pleased by it have not installed them yet they are CTS brand its hard to read what uF are the caps I think they are 0022uF the standard for Fender guitars They bring the caps,positive
I have used many microphones from expensive Neumanns Sennheisers Sure AKG to the less expensive Berringer B2 Pro and Sony I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons First is sound quality all the patterns have a smooth open sound the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode but in that pattern voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich plucky and natural Next is the construction of the mic and stand from the pictures I was expecting plastic nope it is made of very solid metal except the buttons and switches Third is the versatility you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately but with excellence try that with a 200000 Neumann The set up could not be easier just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip I only paid 10000 on Amazona true bargain for what is a top notch piece of gear where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art The Yeti also stands up to audio processing where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under 20000 show their weaknesses The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic it is just too big for all of my other mounts but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do I also use a slab of 14 neoprene padding to absorb some table shock and the Yeti has no real audible self noise If you want a great microphone at an incredible price the Blue Yeti is the one for youAddendum 9302011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved with the Blue Radius which I received a week ago from Amazon which I love Makes this great and I mean great microphone even better I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87 the Sennhieser D421 the Lawson L47 all top notch and very expensive studio mics The Yeti sounds as good Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic some of the folks are not using this and Im sure other mikes correctly to get the best sound Also the more I use the Yeti the more seasoned it becomes in comparison recordings done a year ago the Yeti seems to get a smoother sound as time goes by The Yeti Lives on Top of the Mountain,positive
These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat You may have to drill deeper holes into your guitar in order to use them Just follow the instructions and you can easily attach and detach your strap whenever you feel like it Easy to install and use,positive
This is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use it would probably fall apart fairly quick on the road or if it were adjusted constantlyThat being said its a great little stand for low dutyhome use Im using it with a Blue enCORE 100 microphone which isnt really heavy but still weighs close to a pound This stand holds it very sturdily and with the boom feature it can be set up in just about any position I would ever needIf you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget this is a decent standAnd for less than 25 bucks its a bargain For lowduty use its perfect,positive
These microphones were made for the studio I used it for live performance you better have a good PA System to enjoy the sound there everything that the video showed its a great microphone period Top of the line and it works great thank you Marshall Electronics and Amazon ffsalsayahoocom,positive
I use this cable to run from the balanced XLR outs on my digital piano to the balanced TRS inputs of my audio interface It works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it I am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone Great cable I have been pleased with it,positive
Looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position Not very durable,negative
Having misplaced my Blue Snowflake USB mic I decided to give this recently introduced competitively priced USB mic from Samson a try Samson is maker of the highly popular and effective Zoom personal digital recordersthe H2 and the H4n Its an attractive fully outfitted piece of equipment with handsome packaging a small black box and zippered carrying case with aesthetics apparently inspired by iPod Its smaller and lighter than the Snowflakemore diminutive than the picture would suggest Yet the audio quality strikes me as being somewhat warmer and richer favoring the bass frequencies of spoken narration more than the Snowflake which has slightly cleaner and clearer definition at the treble endThe Samson Go was seen instantly by my iMac and recording was as advertised Plug n Play The mic is somewhat more sophisticated than the Snowflake in terms of latency settings it permits direct monitoring via headphones connected to the mic to insure no delay or lag time between transmission and reception and theres a threeway switch for directional patterns the manual could be clearer however about the difference between cardioid and cardioid 10 pad No matter The mic performed virtually flawlessly right out of the box with no tampering with the switchIts extremely sensitive slightly more so than the Snowflake Yet I was unable to avoid the P popping sounds regardless of how close I got to the mic and muted my consonants So be prepared for the addition of some sort of pop filter device either one sold on Amazon or a selfdesigned one using a nylon stockingThe mic can be clipped to the top of a computer screen or mounted on a mic stand using a supplied adapter or ordering a properly sized one from Samson Yet with its heavy base plus the flexible tilting mic it can be placed on a flat surfacemuch like the Snowflake but with greater stability and without any intrusive cable The Snowflake tends to flop around requiring some balancing of the device by the userMy biggest disappointment thus far is that the clip as alluded to by another reviewer does not open far enough for attachment to a desktop computer it should be an ideal fit with most notebook machines Although the Snowflake doesnt use a spring clip it suffers from the same limitation If youre especially concerned about durability the Snowflake appears to be the heavier more rugged mic with thick metal and no tiny switches or spring clips to wear out The Samson is the more delicate and refined of the two But dont kid yourself Either mic will exceed the capabilities of your computers builtin mic and perhaps the owners expectations On the other hand neither is a match for the Shure SM7B that Im accustomed to using at a local broadcasting studio Still Samson would appear to have a winner with this little wonder whether its used in conjunction with a computer to record fullfrequencied music or realisticsounding narration Strong competitor to Blues Snowflake,positive
I really like these strings Good sound and the feel is good Not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however I only bought one set not three sets and have not had to change them yet after three months Great sound and easy to use,positive
This is my first noise reducer It works and like it says it reduces the noise it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch The switch let you choose if you want it to reduce the noise when is activated or to mute everything when activated The 2 knobs 1 of them let you select the range of the noise you want to reduce the other one how fast you want it to start reducing the noise I noticed a slight change of the original sound of my distortion but it could be also because i didnt find the right setup if the knob of the noise to reduce is on the highest setting then it reduce also the sound of the all guitar so you really gotta study this before you can use it properly overall for the price im happy with it and it hides the hiss and all the other sounds unwanted Its ok,neutral
For most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect You simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a shimmering effect Its used in subtle fashion in everything from to 50s60s rock and surf guitar to modern indie rock But most guitarists like me were never going to shell out 100 or more for a Boss or other expensive tremolo option In fact there really werent that many affordable tremolo pedals on the marketEnter the Joyo JF09 Tremolo This pedal is simple durable affordable 40 45 and it just works The only two controls are for Intensity depth of the volume swells and Rate how fast the swells cycle The LED light dims rhythmically along with the Rate control which is a nice visual indicatorAs for the sound the pedal sounds great It doesnt color or diminish your tone in any way Im not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should If youre the type to obsess over tremolo then you probably arent looking to save money anyway and there are 200 boutique options from Catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features Im not particularly interested in those so the lack of those on the Joyo wont detract from my scoreRegarding the quality and durability of Joyo pedals theres a lot of discussion about that but also some misinformation Ive personally owned 7 of them at one point or another yes I like them that much and Ive yet to have one fail The early run of Joyo pedals is actually quite durable and includes the JF09 Tremolo and every pedal numbered from JF01 through JF17 The more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance and while many of them still sound great they feel lighter cheaper and the switch is a little more suspect I recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the US rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from China Many of the US vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it which is a huge advantageHighly recommended Simple functional tremolo pedal at an affordable price,positive
Looks vintage but works great at a great price As good or better than my Monster cable for a lot less money Vintage look cable,positive
I cant believe Im giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product but they got these right I replaced a waymore expensive Audix condenser mic with these and they actually sound pretty darned good If I crunch one or if one breaks Ill just get more at this price I have other Behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck These are totally fine Totally worth it,positive
I would recommend the DAddario Prelude violin string set to anyone who want to use wirewound strings They are durable and have a nice tone Violinist,positive
I installed the Ragin Cajun into my Fender Super Champ X2 I immediately noticed a difference in the quality fullness and volume of my amp It has turned my amp into a amp that is now capable of being used at small gigs An excellent speaker that I would highly recommed Great Addition to My Amplifier,positive
Im a beginner ukulele player and I bought one of the cheap ukuleles here on Amazon It didnt sound very good and I didnt know if it was the instrument or the strings It was the strings and Im very glad I replaced them with these strings They make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well Im very happy with the purchase Great Sound,positive
It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside its case I have given out 5 and kept 4 I have 11 working guitars I need 7 more Snarks some have had their batteries run down in under a year but I get close to 2 years off a new battery Batteries are a bit costly I have bought many of these,positive
Great Capo Like the color Good clamp pressure and this design wraps around the back of the Guitar neck so it does not show Great Capo,positive
There are a ton of phaser options out there even from MXR themselves which makes this issue a bit confusing Id owned a Phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one A few years ago I didnt have the budget to consider the more expensive MXR versions so I just got this oneI think it sounds fine I gigged with it for years without issue Yes theres a slight volume bump but I think this is really mostly a midrange hump that will alter your tone and give you some distortion depending on how your amp is set up I always use it with a clean tone and Im used to it so its not a big dealIf I were to shop for a phaser today Id consider some of the other MXR models as well as versions from other manufacturers which offer a mix knob A phaser is a very specific sound but I love it in small doses For my needs this one works Very good but limited,positive
Durable yet lightweight and sturdy And the price is right Pacific hardware is excellent right up there with Tama I would buy this again Quality stand,positive
This Guitar Hanger is good looking well made and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my sons acoustic guitar on the wall in his room Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet and so far that seems to be the caseThe hanger was easy to install literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall and is easy to use just place guitar in the padded holder by the neckHighly RecommendedCFH Keeps Your Guitar Handy Highly Recommended,positive
Really a nice mic I did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio I record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful Plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs Makes my voice sound fantastic I read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mineWorth a shot if youre on a budget like me Fantastic Mic for the Price,positive
The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments but it does the job it was made for The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged It does its job,positive
At about twice the price of their standard strings These DAddario NYXL strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability higher breaking point and something called 34fusion twist34 which I swear is a rare Chubby Checker BsideHaving just put a set of these on one of my guitars I cant speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings but I can say they are solid dependable strings with lots of 34punch and crunch34 Solid Dependable strings,positive
just received the cable it sounds clear doesnt feel like it is made of the best materials I just got this cable today so I cant really comment on how durable it is and how long it will last so far I tend to believe it is a decent cable for the price I dont use a microphone very often so this cable should last a while so far it is working well I would buy another one if I needed it the price is right cable works feels a bit flimsy,neutral
I have played listened to and used audio amps for over 4 decades and while I havent owned every name brand amp on the planet I do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when I see one This is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar with an input for a mic XLR no phantom power and a CD player or other audio source It also has a headphone output 14 inch It has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputsI got this originally for my mother who used to sing in an Andrews Sisterstype group back in the day She still loves to sing and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam She hasnt had the opportunity to do that yet but I have tested the amp and put it through its paces I think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind The lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback but considering what I paid for it I cant complainNow this is not a gigging amp at least not in my opinion your mileage may vary It is small solid state with an 8 inch speaker and 15 watts of power I havent measured the exact output so Im taking Behringers word on that I like Behringer and they can turn out some pretty good gear within its limitsI like the sound of the amp with my Carvin acoustic guitar with a Fishman preamp It is an inexpensive practice amp so I dont expect the same kind of quality I would from a more serious combo amp The 8 inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good 12 inch no matter what The question is does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work composition or just moderate entertainment value For me that answer is a clear yesHowever this is an inexpensive practice amp and if you approach it with that attitude I think you will find it a nice little amp Dont plan on using it for your next tour with Manhattan Transfer Seal or Celine Dion great little practice amp,positive
This is the second clip on tuner I have bought This is much better than the other brand I have Its easy to use and see The colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite The built in tap metronome is a cool idea If youre shopping for a tuner give this a try At less than 13 its a fantastic buy Works Great,positive
This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar Comes with everything you need except a drill or a screwdriver of course It is pretty and very strong I originally purchased it to hang on drywall sheetrock for my 5 year olds mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock This is a good buy Cant go Wrong,positive
I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars Ive been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to applyAlong with a few high end guitars I also have a few beaters I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks greatI use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease I will buy this stuff again and again my local guitar shop sells this for the same price Great wax for Flame and Quilt tops,positive
Sure its a bit pricey but I think having a topnotch power supply for your pedalboard is priceless Just being able to do away with a power strip or two full of wall warts is amazing in itself The fact thing this cuts down on floor noise AND conditions your power supply too Sign me up Pair this up with a Pedaltrain board and youve got yourself a sweet setup Solidly Built And Definitely Worth The Investment,positive
This tuner is affordable and it works well I have purchased six so far They are sturdy They have all come with a battery in the box you have to install yourself I actually sat on one and thought I broke it turned out the main tuner head pops right back on to the goose neck The LED is bright in low light but does not display well in bright daylight If the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery The fairly large disk style battery cost me 980 for a twopack at Walgreens We had a Birthday Jam at a friends house I used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists At the end of the night I gave it to the birthday boy as he had admired it all night I gave one to my grandnephews I keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars They stay on in their cases I like the goose neck style but I have not tried the other noneck swivel ones I also have one for my Bass Its a great musicians party favor I always had trouble reading my old analog tuners in low light so I really like these tuners Dont forget Practice Practice Practice Easy to stay in tune Small handy time saving,positive
I actually use this stand for more than holding a micI use it for video and photo purposes Holding light reflectors flagging speedlights etcIts heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo Multi use stand,positive
I am giving this item 5 stars because it is awesome litle mixer was not expecting much for the price but this little unit it is very small as I went from Mackie 1202 to the Berhinger 1202 anyone see a similarity here this is basically the same as the Mackie mixer but slightly smaller recieved it hooked it up and it worked perfect few minor adjustements and sounded as good as the Mackie perhaps better plus it took up less space on my desk Only weird thing about this unit and it has been mentioned before is no ON OFF switch whyproblem solved by using a power strip and using the power strip to power the unit on and off the only other way to power it on off is by unplugging it from the back to turn it on and plugging it back in to turn it on using the power strip to avoid much wear and tear on the power source connector this was really stupid of Behringer never ever had any kind of mixer without a power on off button All in all for the price I should not complain much will pick up another for my daughters studio as it is that good Excellent Little Powerhouse,positive
Im impressed with these EXP16 guitar strings What I ExpectedA more dead sound than the noncoated strings they replaced Coated strings usually lack the bright highend brilliance that uncoated light strings have What I GotA very bright yet not to twangy sound When I put Light strings on my acoustic Im going for easy playability and most of all a very bright and airy sound These deliver on both counts DurabilityThe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes So far they are holding their tone and brightness I will report back after three months My last set started to sound dull and exhibit more tone variation after six months when viewed with a very sensitive tuner it seems that my dirtier strings detune sharp a bit more on attack the harder you strum them This is confirmed by the fact that they just sound out of tune to me when they get dirty ConclusionI will be ordering more of these I think they perform very well for the price Love the bright light gauge sound and playability Sound like uncoated strings,positive
good price for effect if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you I have amps that have this feature that due a better job Good price for effect,neutral
Simple Solid Compact Convenient Audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables For the money you cant beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit Simple yet effective,positive
This is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use Its easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone Its easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not The only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes Great tuner,positive
casual part time guitar player here I use it on the back of the headstock to always have picks with the guitar when I pick it up The one I received was all black not brown on the sides as in the photo No matter It is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo I dont know if that is to accommodate a larger size of pick or what It is big enough that normal electric guitar picks can almost turn sideways in it It also likes to give you more than one pick at a time Both of which I would say make it not a contender for fast pick replacement like in the middle of a song But it is good for keeping them all in one place either on the guitar or a desk toolbox etcNice little item for 2 quick easy way to keep picks at hand,positive
These cans were decent back when they were just above 100 bucks Theyve inflated to 160 and thats just ridiculous There is better in this price range The SRH840s for example on eBay for 120 bucks new does everything better than these cans The M50s have really punchy bass and extremely stringent highs theyre very loose in the low end and their mids are recessed That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable whilst having an almost starchy texture to them The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all which means for gaming these will be pretty terrible They do some SOME new genres alright but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to They also cant do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positoning There are much much better monitors in this price range than these the Shure SRH840 as Ive said before totally outclass these headphones in all areasStay away dont fall victim to the noob hype Really harsh and uncomfortable,negative
I really dig these I have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks and the worst thing is that when I drop them they are impossible to find on my beige carpet The one Im using has barely worn with at least 10 hours of playing on itThe size of the pick is the same as normal it is just more tapered I tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it but it was a little to much work as I dipped it too far into the strings so I reverted back to a wider gator grip 114 which works better with the bigger strings I am still searching for the worlds perfect allpurpose pick This works until then Good for lead guitar,positive
These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull and I absolutely love their sound feel and durability The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast The sound is almost identical to what DAddario describes these strings have a great uplifting sound to them hard to soft strums Playing feels great with them nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel clean and smooth When replacing I ran into no problems quick and easy I love the strings and their price definitely will stick with this brand as well Sound Amazing On My Seagull Top Pick For Strings,positive
This strap is genuine suede leather so it is really comfortable and has lots of friction so no sliding around on my shoulders while Im playing Its plenty long for any guitar size or shoulder width and adjusting is just like most leather straps Taylor logo makes it look good and officialNothing bad to say about this strap Perfect for my Taylor 514ce and super comfortable,positive
Purchased primarily for Rocksmith and it works very well for that Still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar Looks great and plays great Was packaged very well Only needed minor setup adjustments I would recommend getting strap locks Nice for the money,positive
I bought a Hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case I decided to take it anywhere The prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times I have other guitars and they all have cases and I might never actually take this guitar anywhere so I didn twant to spend a lot Price was a big issue The guitar fits great The bag is well padded and I cant believe the price Fit the bill for a reasonable price,positive
These picks have served me very well I am happy with the quality of all of them I would purchase additional Planet Waves Assorted Pearl Celluloid Guitar Picks Picking,positive
So I bought this to replace the original string winder I had that doesnt have a clipper on the end and it turned out great The clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better Thank you planet waves Awesome upgrade from the one without the clipper,positive
I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing and it seems to have made my fingertips slick So I have a hard time holding on to picks when I use them on upstrokes Im sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem but its more fun to blame the pick These picks were no different from picks without the 34gator grip34 IMHO But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully Soso,neutral
I love this assortment Every color and size youll ever need You can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while This was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality I would buy this again or recommend to anyone I use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though Definitely a 5 star purchase Fantastc assortment,positive
Ive been using it for nearly a year now I was going to buy the Boss RV5 when I somehow discovered Biyang I had never heard of them but at 13 the price of the Boss AND stereo Ins and Outs I gave it a try and I havent looked back The 3 modes are nice I leave mine set on hall because Ive never liked spring reverb but the spring setting on this pedal does sound exactly like a spring reverb The decay time in any mode is more than enough for probably anybody and I can say the same for the blend control Overall this is a great pedal with lots of sounds that will suit just about any style of playing More than enough decay and wetness Seems wellbuilt Ive since bought other Biyang pedals and I have never had any issues like other reviewers have stated Im not ashamed of having Chinese clones on my board In fact I highly recommend Biyang whenever somebody asks about it Versatile versatile and versatile,positive
Its a lot smaller than the picture makes it look but thats a good thing It serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock Handy,positive
I ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount It seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on Its especially effective when the microphone is on my desk where my computer tower which has 7 fans is directly under it Its not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing On top of all that it looks nice too If you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk you should definitely consider getting this along with a solid stand and a pop filter Necessity,positive
Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me This cloth cleans up pretty well but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook I dunno if they werent meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better Like a previous reviewer im a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washerUpdate Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before i like this and my ernie ball cloth From 3 to 5 starts Does the job,positive
Nice reverb Can get all of the reverb sounds you want Got to play with it but I got dialed in easy Great,positive
I have always loved line 6 This product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up It went dead I changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead I am sorry to say that I returned it My AKG wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outsI am really disappointed What happened,negative
At first I thought this would be a gimmick but it was cheap so I figured what the hell Once I had it however I realized how invaluable it was When performing live I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic Once I got this little guy though I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times Volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear It also protected my mic in a fall once too Can find anything better for this cheap SO underrated a musthave for any performingaspiring vocalist podcaster or anyone who uses microphones for live audio,positive
Just got it so far so good I use delay pretty light n tight slapback vibe not too wet This does it well I considered the MXR delay no I may have considered it but the only pedal failure Ive ever experienced was my MXRDunlop Phase 90 first the DC input then the stomp switch after lightbarely any bedroom use This ModTone here seems solidly constructed I havent played with it too much yet but as of right now I wouldnt recommend it for Edge wannabes seems limited in that regard I may be wrong but either way do we need more Edge wannabesNo we do notGood tone though does the trick trick Good basic delay lay lay lay lay lay,positive
This is my favorite acoustic guitar stand Its easy to use on stage it can be used with only one hand and it has a low profile that doesnt take up a lot of space when folded and it doesnt stick out as an eyesore on stage I use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it Favorite Acoustic Stand,positive
Strings are not just strings Guitar strings are another very important part of playing GREAT Guitar And all Martin products are second to none Strings,positive
Works perfectly Nice feel to it and seems sturdy You just have to remember not to turn on the keyboard with your foot down otherwise it switches polarity and does the opposite of what you want it to Great,positive
I have played on Daddario Before actually the first string I started out onSuper lights are ok but can wear out real fast So Its importent not to put to much stess on themespescially if You do alot of tricks pinched hormonics vibratos extreme bends etc they will break Any skilled guitarist knows to use extream caution when tuningany stringsI did try extra light while they do soud niceand have a nice feel to them I would not recamend these for beginers cause beginers tend to press hard when they first stat outPersonally I dont like Daddarios at all I find the tone to bright Not the best,negative
Rugged pedal by a little known company Took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye Great univibeishold chorus device Would like to see stereo output options in future models Solid If you have a Strat have studied Jimi then it will suit you well if youve got the right physical approach to the guitar itself Sweet,positive
I had previously owned it Digitech jam man I also try the bossAfter seeing demos of this item on YouTube I decided Ill give it a try I can always return it if I didnt like itThe unit is extremely small but dont let that fool you This unit is a highquality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly You get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs Lets be serious how many people really Loop for over five minutesThe unit is transparent when turned off I would highly recommend this Looper its well worth the money Best looper out there,positive
My wife plays the fiddle and the mandolin and this stand works great for both of them It even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport like it,positive
This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it This has a replaceable sponge you take it out soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container would say it gets more humidity out Does The Job,positive
This thing is like a magic Spray HahSeriously I used this on noisy hinges car doors etcI really bought it to clean the POTs volume controls and knobs on my Guitars pedals and equipment It really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example Magic Spray,positive
I have been playing guitar for longer than I care to admit Back in 1966 I went into the music store with my Dad and cherry picked the finest Fender Telecaster in the whole store Back then they were all handmade so there were variations and by spending some time would yield you an incredible find So I am not a newbie to playing or working on guitars I didnt use this capo on my 66 because I have it apart in order to make exact vintage reproductions of the bodyTodays modern guitars use medium jumbo frets My 66 had thin frets With the medium jumbo frets they are sufficiently high that if you check them once fretting a note with something as accurate as the Snark SN 2 All Instrument Clip on Chromatic Tuner you will see that the note moves up one or two bars on the tuner once you fret it That is one or two bar above the note you are then fretting So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enable me to adjust it so that the guitar doesnt go out of tune when using a capoI compared the G7 Performance Capo the Six String Silver with the Schubb S1 Stainless Steel Guitar Capo for Steel String Guitars and this Planet Waves NSTriaction capo Although the G7 was substantially built and looked rather impressive I found it to be too bulky so it kept getting in the way while trying to play chords So I sent it back So now it comes down to the Shubb 1 Deluxe and the Planet Waves I went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times I would perfectly tune the guitar with the Snark and then apply the capo I tried to discern the difference between which one of these would make the guitar go out of tune more than the other I finally concluded that there was no differenceThe Schubb S1 had the ability to be adjusted so fine that it would barely be holding on to the neck If you set that one at its gentlest setting you could get it to be almost perfectly in tune even with the capo on but set it that softly and it would just about fall off the guitar So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance The Planet Waves Capo in contrast even at the lightest setting was still a solid grip on the neck I also noticed that the planet waves had a wider spread across the strings and therefore was less critical of the positioning in order to get it rightThe Schubb S1 is a wellmade product it has nicely finished metal components but with its roller ball system of fastening when you loosen it for sure youre going to occasionally be dropping it in on the floor You could say that requires two hands in order to remove it The Planet Wave on the other hand is a true onehanded tool that makes it easy to remove and to put back on I tried both of these on one of my other Fender telecasters as well as on one of my acoustics I got the same tuning results on all of them I am very critical and exact so when I say that the tuning results would change when you put on the capo you must understand that the tuner was only moving one line Most people wouldnt even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune perfect harmony rules You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune there is nothing to compare to itThe planet wave is a little bit bulkier and if I had to get critical of it I would say it does get in the way a tiny bit more than the Schubb S1 although this factor is not such a great difference as to preclude me choosing one over the other The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet WavesI saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of There are so many factors affecting the tone such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way then it was the last time For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that mightve been projecting more from the side of the guitar I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge So at least between these two I found no total differencesI wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings Id rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings To each his own they say I just consider it important to let you know that Im conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic So if youre running a much heavier gauge string with lower action you would of course have less tuning shift going on because you could adjust the capo and both of these have a round adjusting knob for finetuning and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it wont slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter settingOf course all this is predicated upon you not retuning the guitar when you change the capo position That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position Im sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesnt impede the overall quality of their performance I find on the other hand that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tuneSo I conclusion I find the planet waves easiertouse and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well as being the one that I highly recommend Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second and with its slightly smaller size it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves All in all they both are the best of all the ones Ive tried Capo Shootout Between the Planet Waves G7th Performance Capo and the Shubb S1,positive
Ive been using these picks for eight months and they last forever I lose them before they wear out Ill be buying and recommending these for a long time Last Forever,positive
For the money you can not beat this The quality is great for the money I mainly use this at home for my project studio but have used it in a professional studios a few times The stands my studio uses are a lot more expensive then this but work just the same The only difference is obvious that this stand my not last for ever with everyday use in a professional enviorment I see this stand lasting me for at least five or six years at home Love it,positive
Its nice and easy to use Secures the strings very good and works for all types of guitars with no issues nice and easy,positive
I absolutely love these strings Im used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly They have a great full sound and after breaking them in after a couple weeks of playing they give a really good classic P bass sound Its not for people who want the modern brighter sound but for the classic 50s 60s and 70s sound these are great Great strings Great Price,positive
Didnt want to spend 150 for a reverb so gave this a try Nice unit Recreates spring reverb very accurately Playing through a 333 tube amp and it sounds like the spring amp in my Fender For the price you cant go wrong Good reverb at great price,positive

What makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently If you have a standard size guitar neck dont bother with that I would have preferred something that was stationary that I could just stick the guitar in As it is I have to jiggle and align it a bit using 2 hands sometimes which will be annoying after awhile If I buy another it would be a standard hanger Not bad,neutral
I will start with saying this is NOT a Class 1 Tube amp meaning ALL tube in the preampAND the amplifier sections I will also say that if you can find one used buy it It is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp Ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love itThe Super Champ XD is considered a hybrid amp It uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid 15 watts of sound The power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube I am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid Thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the webThis amp has two channels one clean Classic Blackface tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in 16 effects and 16 different amplifier voicesYou can purchase a foot switch for about 25 that enable you switch between channelone and channel twoThe amp also has a 14 Speaker Out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker There is also a 14 Line Outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment Unfortunately there is not aHeadphone Output or Effects LoopThe amplifier use three tubes 1x 12AX7 and 2x 6V6s Its speaker is a 10 inch 8ohmSpecial Design Fender If you want to get louder fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a Eminence Rajin Cajun You can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think Some players are comfortable with the stock speakerWith regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods This is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just thatI will say that the clean channel is very nice whether I play through my Gibsons or myFender Tele I very much enjoy the clean Blackface sound of the amp It will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the MasterThe Digital Voicing ProcessorDSP from what I read from more experienced players arepretty darn close to the original Voices like Tweed British Think Vox jangle FenderHot Rod Metal an Acoustic super clean tone optimized for finger picking There is alsoa clean Jazz tone that has the character of the Fender Jazz King amplifier Again I amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voicesWith regard to the Effects Vibratone Delay Reverb Chorus and Tremolo the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic It is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want authenticIf you want or need a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp It weighs only 25 pounds 109kg so its portability is very good This ampwas a wonderful deal at 300 when I originally bought it in 2011 It is still a good dealtoday if you can find one used Great Little Amp Fender Super Champ XD,positive

I have several of these straps in different colors and Ive never been disappointed It holds my 11 pound Les Paul with no problems and the first one I bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong If you like the design go for it Sturdy comfortable strap,positive
I know the kind of person I am If I buy a big pedal board Ill have to spend hundreds of dollars to fill it up with great effects Buy a smaller board and I can be selective in the pedals I buy and save by not trying to fill it Hence the purchase of the Pedaltrain MiniThis board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply When I initially purchased it I was hoping that I could fit the power supply under the board but I tried a few small power units from Guitar Center and none would fit and allow the board to lay flush I should probably ding one star for this and it would be a great improvement if pedaltrain would just raise the board about 18 to allow for the power to be mounted under the boardThe unit is VERY sturdy and ships with velcro to secure pedals to the top The velcro feels like its military grade and does a great job of securing the pedals Its light easy to carry and I can grab the case in one hand with my guitar in the same hand and carry my amp with the other hand only one trip from the car to the gigOverall this is a great board I currently have a looper overdrive distortion echo and tuner on my unit Ive added a photo of my board Great board for approx 5 pedals,positive
no complaints attaches firmly and does the job Cant beat it for the price Order this with eyes closed Great deal Works fine,positive
Honest for cost its 5 star but I got 2 and 1 handle was slightly mismolded rubber groove is a little off But in no way matters Just kinda ok really now I can tell them apart by feelThis is a nice heavy Cordura like military spec heavy with self repairing zippers standard kind and totally adequate pad soft nylon lined and bonus pockets 3 Nice build PVC piping on pocket edges adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight Heavy rubber feet for standing it up give a 12 of wet ground protection if neededFor the price of 1 many other brands I got 2And for what most folks expect they are great saver,positive
I use two of these as LR channels and my Fishman Soloamp as a center channel I use a Rode NT4 stereo mic run everything through my Mackie mixer adding some reverb and delay delay a little of the left send to right channel and vice versa and it sounds fantastic way better than with just the Fishman alone Another tip Get a copy of Yamahas Sound Reinforcement Handbook when it comes to audio there are so many aspects that all effect each other so you really need a good technical understanding of it otherwise you could randomly mess around with everything forever just to get an ok sound A lot of sound for the size,positive
Apparently one can never have too many guitars and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access Very stable The autolocking heads rock Foldsup pretty compact for travel The optional carry bag is a must IMHO Because you have too many guitars,positive
The yellow material has a rough texture coated over it that gives it a nice rubbery grip with a smooth snappy tone Nice grip on the material,positive

The DAddario Balanced Tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price These are excellent strings the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar They are inexpensive and sound great For somebody that is a casual home musician coated strings might be a better choice The difference somebody that plays a two or three hours every day will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in Somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problemThe big question for me is the Balanced Tension worth a little extra money It seems like yes they are The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better There isnt a huge difference The direct comparison string is DAddario EXL110 DAddario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings Regular Light 1046 at roughly 350 a set these are good solid strings at a bargain price The EXL110BT strings are about 500 a set If I were going through a set of strings every few days the EXL110s would probably be a better idea But if a set is going to last a week or two the savings overall is pretty small I would use the EXL110BTsMy personal preference is coated strings I like Elixir strings a lot The new DAddario coated strings are fine but they end up being about the same price as Elixir Ill stick with what I know wellMy 1981 Lucille did love these strings They worked out just fineOn the packaging I dont like what DAddario has done All the strings are in a single plastic package I prefer individual paper envelopes They loop two strings together and I hate that When Im stringing my guitar I like to work with one string at a time and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while They are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing But seriously that little paper wouldnt kill anybody I also dont care for the color coded rings on the strings Lucille has an open bridge where I can see those electric colors It is a small thing but I dont like it I prefer that the rings all be brass one color Yeah Im the only one that sees that problem If I work one string at a time from an individual envelope the color coding is not necessaryThese are fine strings They are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend Nice Strings Great Price,positive
A nice addition to my recording home studio I recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music Quality at a good price,positive
the reason I bought them is I only needed a few I live in BFE and there is no real place to buy any on my drive home from work so I got these and delivered to my doorstep all is well with the world work fine,positive
Slinky is used by tons of professionals because they work well and endure rough playingThese strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory stringschange yours now amazing,positive
I love the way this tuner works with a bright screen and easy to use controls The metronome feature is also a nice addition Its a bit lightweight making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once but it hit the floor many times on me already and its still going strong This is a great tuner at an even better price try it out and see for yourself Very well made tuner,positive
Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering themEdit Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn nicked picks Rapidlyfirmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know The edge is now smooth and nice My favorite pick for over 30 years,positive
BOTTOM LINE The Orange Micro Terror is powerful hybrid amp head capable of driving any number of speakers you throw at it Its low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your handWHY ONLY 3 STARS For starters this is what I would consider a noveltyboutique amplifier because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss but its lack of clean headroom is evident Its an Orange after all and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1channel to work with this head is for you Playing with a Les Paul I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30 I was able to find the sweet spot on the Tone knob which for me was around 1 oclock and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max I had entered a very musical lush and totally gigworthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix Angus Young and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with However as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punchncrunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond Unfortunately the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category and for this if were starting at 5 stars I have to subtract one star I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesnt exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise which leads to feedback I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if youre in a rock band already own a 2x12 or 4x12 and want something quick and small to use to rock out with The problem is if youre one of those people you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse This leads me to my final point if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple but GREAT oneWHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal Having owned several different combo amps and headcabinet variations over the years the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs If I were starting over from scratch Id probably buy two 2x12 cabs a Micro Terror and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal studio recording small bar big bar club or concert stage venuesTO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL Ive noticed this review and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes It seems like people want this to be a 5Star Amp but always with the caveat of but its 150 what do you expect or they begin their rave review with For a 150 amp Look I dont judge gear just by price I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first The reality is you need a really nice 1x12 2x12 or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing If youre dropping 150 for the Terror and probably another 150250 for a great cab why not spend that 300 or so on a great ALLtube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels better EQ and the option to route to an external cab from the getgo Agent Orange,neutral
After reading all of the reviews here and around the Internet I took a chance since this is my first professionallevel microphone Im glad I did because its really greatOne thing you will need though is a phantom power unit I wish I could remember which one I got here on Amazon I think it was about 2535 but it worked great Excellent sound quality much better than any other mic Ive used Excellent Mic,positive
These headphones are kind of classics Very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites They are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones However when I compare them to my other headphones Sennheiser HD595s I find that these are very very inferior I had originally intended for them to be used with my digital piano because I wanted some isolation which my HD595s do not provide These do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior I think closedstyle headphones are just not up to the task of reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphonesI use these at work now They are excellent at blocking out room noise and they provide enough quality for me to listen to music while workingUnfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my Sennheisers They are a bit too small for my ears I guess And they get hot Overall they are just not as good They were a good price though and they fill a niche that I need If only I could find a set of really high quality closed cans for my piano now Great headphones but my others are much better Good isolation though,positive
The Pignose is not the worlds best travel amp or portable amp or practice amp Its not very good for vocals its inefficient what with its 40year old design and it distorts way too easy There are far better amps for most purposes from Boss and others that deliver a lot more clean volume thanks to modern classD amp technology and a variety of digital effects to bootBUT there is one area where the Pig prevails If youre looking for the sound of a big overdriven amp in the studio or miked on stage the Pignose will give you that sound for less than the cost of one good quality overdrive pedal By opening and closing the box you can get a range of cabinet sounds from the openback Fender to the classic Marchall sealed cab and everything in between Frank Zappa recorded a lot of his guitar parts using nothing but his SG running into a Pignose and he got fantastic soundsBeyond that its cool looking reasonably rugged and even has pegs that allow you to hang it from a guitar strap Every rocker needs one A classic,positive
Very nice clip on tuner for the priceI actually got this as a gift for a friend and they seem to really like it Decent tuner,positive
Ive only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well The cover is supple and easy to coil Works Good,positive
We use these at our church to light up stands for performing music or doing readings during worshipI appreciate the adjustable antennae so that the lights can be directed to specific areas The light is bright enough to be able to read even if the room is otherwise in darkness I do wish they had one more LED in the heads though with two standard 812 x 11 pages on the music stand the outer edges cannot be lit directly though there is enough bleed over light to see it its not as bright as it could be Just another 20 output would make these 5 stars perfectConstructionwise theyre slightly fragile clearly not made for industrial or heavy duty use but for standard usage they will hold up just fine and should last for yearsWe love them we have 7 or 8 at the church that we use Theyre especially wonderful because theyre battery operated With all the cords we already have from microphones its wonderful not to have an equal number of extra power cords running a bunch of electric lights Theres an extra environmental cost with using the batteries versus plugging them in but the handiness adaptability and lack of extra cords make it worth itDefinitely recommend these to anyone and also recommend the manufacturer add another 20 or so lumens They work excellently and provide a good though not quite enough amount of light,positive
Ive been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade Theyre sturdy and convenient and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap The ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage or when you dont need the strap hanging from your guitar eg sitting in a chair works exactly as advertised Ive purchased several of these and cant say enough good things about the product and company GREAT solution for acoustic guitar,positive
When I got this I thought it was a cheap toylike thing but when I put it on my banjo it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else but easy to see when I needed it Its red when out of tune and green when in tune It does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned I love it when I am the only one using it Unlike the clamp kind like the Snark its hard to share The clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to so between my husband and me using it Im afraid the thing will break I play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it Very small,positive
Only complaint is that the cameo is not as well done as shown in the picture Other than that the strap is of good quality solid guitar strap,positive
Excellent guitar strings they last a long time sound great and are pretty cheap Excellent strings and great value,positive
Well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hoursNow thats a Fun king wah wahIts big its hard and its heavy but when you turn it on you understand why this is the original It sounds exactly like how i always imagined like in all those recordsThis one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be Now thats a wah wah,positive
Easy to use accurate programmable lights up easy to read decent quality I like it Korg has never disappointed me Does the job,positive
I purchased the On Stage brand microphone stand to use with a theremin although I may use it at some point for the purpose for which it was designed This is a substantial stable very solidly built stand The base is heavy enough the I cant image that the stand would fall over in normal use Should the need arise it is also easy to disassemble and assemble Highly recommended Solid All Around,positive
it works well and gets the job done but the battery dies way to quickly other than that its has a cool clip that lets it be placed anywhere it okay,neutral
Wow This is the pedal to own There are a lot of good pedals out there but this one has that original bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from 70s quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps Just amazing If you dont have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine A great purchase and built like a tank The original but even better,positive
I have these on several of my guitars and I love them Nice and stable easy to change strings and lock tightly Always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing To note these have the two peg placement anchors on them so if your headstock only has the single hole for the tuning peg you will have to do some drilling Really nice upgrade for your standard tuners have these on several of my guitars and I love them Nice and stable,positive
Ive bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit Well the hunt is over Amazing tone perfect tuning Im completely amazed with this capo The Best,positive
I used this along with a Dunlop DC adapter and it all fits nicely Im powering a Zoom MS50G and a Fulltone OCD It will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs Saves on batteries in the long run,positive
It does what it says it will but its still not a great pedalboard solution The distance between the plugs is sometimes too short Also if youre not using ALL the plugs youve got a dangling end youve got to try and stash or tie off Again its a good item for what it does but it has inherent problems if youre pedalboard has varying distances between pedals Good but not great,positive
I bought these for my teen son who plays the bass He absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well Nice sounds Use for Bass guitar very pleased,positive
These balanced patch cables are great This is the third set of various music cables Ive purchased from this brand and they are all great quality for the price Love their XLR microphone cables too Great cables from GLS,positive
Ive been using Ernie Balls cobalt slinky light gauge because I like the feel I got these from the Vine and wow they are awesome They cost no more than the strings I normally get but the tone and feel is totally different I cant comment on how long theyll last or keep in tunebut for now Im impressed Ill probably keep using these on my Santana PRS for awhile since I like the sound Every once in awhile Ill step outside of my boxI mean I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them I use daddario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electricsexcept for my stratI like fender bullets on it So the sample from the Vinesorta of nudged meand Im the better for it Awesome Tone,positive
Most 12AX7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should Psychoacoustics being what it is I cant honestly tell you for sure ElectroHarmonix tubes are measurably better than the noname Chinese tubes I replace But I THINK the ElectroHarmonix tubes sound better therefore they do At 12 per shot who cares I suppose I could contrive a doubleblind experiment to settle the existential question empirically but Id rather spend my time playing Rest assured ElectroHarmonix is GOOD stuff and the price is right Just do it Inexpensive Excellence Whether I Need It Or Not,positive
Good string action out of the box Nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone Inexpensive acoustic guitar,positive
My mother plays the guitar I am a banjomandolin player and the Snark SN2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days She opened it up got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasnt been in tune since I dunno and she LOVED it lulz This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN2 had a mic One less accessory in the little bag now DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo mmm I would still highly recommend using an audible metronomeSide note if you have friendsfamily that play a string instrument be aware your Snark SN2 WILL be making the rounds Even my mother loved it,positive
I use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp I do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new I was initially concerned when I first received the cable that it would not last The cable is not as fat as I had hoped however the ends are solid and sturdily built I usually use Mogami Gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so if that long This Hosa Cable is a very good cable and I even chose to use Hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals They last Good cable,positive
Very compact size and easy to useGood feature for the priceShipping is fastvery happy for this productBest recommended Easy to use and accurate tuning,positive
I use these pins on some of my 34 size guitars Not really sure if I can notice a difference in sound between these plastic or ebony pins that I have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different attractive and well made,positive
I ordered this strap to use with both my concert tenor ukes It just worksI already owned a ukulele leashtype thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the ukes sound hole or tie it off to the head The problem of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body sometimes disastrously With a strap like this one you can completely let go of your uke it stays perfectly in place Chord changes strumming become easier when you dont have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neckThis is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke and uke player sizes It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way In my case I installed two buttons more convenient and the strap doesnt interfere with my chordhand Here are the buttons I usedStrap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant put your fears aside It can be done quickly easily and the end result is well worth it Heres an entertaining howto video that will walk you through it Stick with the strap,positive
Got this for my electric guitar I am able to adjust it to the length I play with Very sturdy guitar strap Not too bad,positive
Takes the edge off the violin sound I keep it on my office violin so I dont disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly Mutes slightly,positive
I am very pleased with this purchase The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap 5 capo before This is well worth your pay Excellent,positive
I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use Assembly was pretty easy and took little time 7 Multi Guitar Bass Folding Stand,positive
I bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter as she is learning to play My son has also joined in the fun This is a pretty complex amp and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do It can be a little daunting for a newbie This is a nice starter amp,positive
These picks have proven their worth when I thrash them on my strings in an epic guitar solo or extreme metal I find myself playing all too often Great picks would buy em againBottom lineThese guitar picks are outstanding Great for metal rock and whatever,positive
I usually dont use anything lighter than 10s because I think the tone starts to get thin on both the highs or the lows I had already tried these in the 10 gauge size and when these were offered via the Vine program I thought what the heck I have a guitar which I believe the tension is always high and tried these on that instrument They do seem to help the string tension issue and the low end sounds to these 62 year old ears quite comparable to the 10s However I do think there is still a thinning of the high end but thats subjective I gave the 10s a 5 rating and realistically I would give these 45 id I could If youre into 9 gauge strings I recommend these but Ill stick with 10s and 11s Very good strings tone starts to thin,positive
Its easy to install very tough and I love how it looks It can support quite a bit of weight assuming you properly installed it on a stud and not in drywall and helps with cable management on a rough day Simple and Great,positive
My go to strap be it brown or blackJust plain tool leather cant beat itTakes sweat and breaks in great always well made Old faithful,positive
I love this little deviceThe colors of the display are a nice touch red on the left hand side and green on the rightThe color of the deviceThe interface is great and the clip works wellIts very accurate and I love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord versus being hard to readA very attractive price I bought two It would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it And its so cheap it wouldnt matter if you lost it Love this little device,positive
You take the packs and put them in the sleeves There is a double sleeve and a single sleeve I have the double behind the neck of my guitar in its guitar case and the single behind the body It has worked so far It is very arid where I live and I want my fret board to be happy Simple and Easy,positive
Its hard to find a good clipon tuner thats accurate and visible in all situations The Snark SN8B is my favorite so far Its really bright more accurate that other Snarks and despite other reviews saying it breaks easily Ive found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is Again its a clipon tuner so dont expect razorsharp accuracy But it does a good enough job for what it is Its quick and convenient If you need something more accurate I recommend investing in a good pedal Ive found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display I dont typically use the metronome feature but its nice to have it Overall my favorite Snark model and my favorite clipon tuner Best Ive found,positive
These arent my first set I cant count the amount of Monster 14 cables I bought and own None has ever failed me so far Highly recommend these Great Product,positive
While this hanger is not unattractive and is well built I could and will modify it to better suit my needs The design of the hanger causes the neck of the 34uke34 to stand off of the wall 2 inches at the head and 312 inches at the hanger itself and 3 inches at the base of the body This is not an easy fix but it is doable Stands out,neutral
These are great I have these on all my guitars Only problem is the clip on install to the strap If you cant get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place Once installed you are good for life Use on all my guitars,positive
I have found Hosa cables to be an excellent value More expensive cables may be more rugged but for the price Im very happy with the Hosas I have purchased Nice cable for the price,positive
SOUND QUALITY The BX5 sounds neutral and balanced Compared to similar sized consumer speakers they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs ie teen EQ The even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours It also lacks a midrange bump and sounds a bit recessed or laidback compared to average earbuds or home speakers In fact the BX5 sounds similar to my Sennheiser 580HD headphones but with less lower bass And thats a good thing for mixing as you dont want speakers that add color andor bumps in the frequency responseUnlike typical passive stereo speakers the BX5 is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer ie biamped This design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver The downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editingAt first the BX5 struck me as underpowered for a 70 watt rating at least with a signal directly from my Mac Pro However once jacked into the hotter signal from my MOTU Ultralite the true power of the BX5 was revealed It was loud and could be painfully so if crankedThese are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out your head should form a triangle with the two speakers That diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is MIA In fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection Perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties So dont buy these for standard stereo or home theatre useI mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings live and multitrack so the bass range is perfect for me The bass extends down to a clear 60Hz so plenty ump for dropD and dropC tuning If you mix bass guitar and kick drum youll want larger speakers BX8 or a sub but these are great for guitarIm used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass mid and highs for different room responses and taste Oddly the PDF instructions show EQ switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers I assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measureRFI RESISTANCE Im an inner city dweller and live in a high RFI area Cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes So one of the major selling points for me was MAudios claim of RFI shielding Luckily that was no mere marketing jive They really are well shielded against RFI Not a single wayward drum loop or DJ in my tracks not even when cranked I cant make that claim for prior speakers Ive ownedHEAT These speakers run on the warm side the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session Not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips It has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat However I have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions I live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up Not a deal breaker but its wise to turn them off when not in use I use a power strip so I dont have to flip two separate switchesCONSTRUCTION These are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed Cinema Display and MOTU Ultralite Construction appears very good with dense particle board MDF cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit and matching plastic front molding around the drivers The cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl These monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driverThe bass drivers are Kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam and the tweeters sport silk domes No protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors So the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstickCONNECTIONS Like most studio monitors the BX5 comes with pro audio style jacks for 14 inch phone plugTRS and XLR If youre a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks RCA or USB So you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters If youre an experienced recordist you should have plenty of these cables laying around but otherwise be prepared to reach for your walletOne of the things I like about the BX5 is both the TRS and XLR connections are active at the same time allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches I have an Audioengine D1 DAC connected to the TRSphone input for iTunes movies games etc while a MOTU Ultralite for mixing tracking is plugged into the XLR connectionLAST BLURB Yes the small Focal speakers I listened to were better sounding and louder than the BX5 but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches However a perfect monitor for a home studio isnt only about a good neutral sound but also about compactness appearance and value And the BX5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine Jim Dandy n Darn Tootin BX5,positive
If you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these They are well made and do work I would buy them again A must,positive
I bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic Learned my lesson Should of just forked over the money for an ae I have a Yamaha F335 I really like I say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so I thought Id try it I first picked up a transducer for about 3 and experimented I like it sounded good then I saw this from Axl and I thought Id try it Installing it wasnt bad except I bought a set of drill bits I didnt need for 10 So I got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright I just wanted it for playing around at home so I didnt need real great sound quality But sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves I think quick connect strap connector My other complaint is I couldnt turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching Overall product quality is good Setup was ok Price was good Sound in my opinion needs some tweaking Lesson learned,negative
I have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar This little device gives me autocorrect for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which arent overbearing and the pitch correction sounds really natural Now I just need 2 more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound Auto correction for my bad habits,positive
Not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap itll do Limited dynamic range But it works Wish Id have gotten something a little nicer though Its OK Monotone,negative
I shouldve just got this cable the first time I have been using Monster for years I recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way perfect cable for my GIBSON Sg super quiet and sounds powerful,positive

My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke so we ordered this set based on decent reviews Wonderful We learned to play thanks to this kit While the instrument itself certainly isnt of high quality it is more than adequate and has a good sound The real jewel in the crown tho is the instruction book Fab It is highly informative easy to follow and has some good songs in it I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby Perfect For Our Purpose,positive
A cute little monster thats surprisingly loud and versatile I bought primarily for travel and Im pleased with my purchase Dont expect too much for 20 its all plastic and you should be satisfied too The amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings fuzz twang etc I also purchased the AC adaptor since these things typically eat batteries Good things in a small package,positive
I teach guitar classes at a community college and spend my days in a room full of twangin n strummin guitars Human ears and tuners with external mics including iPhone app tuners have trouble in such an environment Why The cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines So I bring an extra beefySeiko Sat800 Durable Style Chromatic Tunerand Korg CM100L mic to class for students to use And it works great clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the SeikoThe Seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years Unfortunately the CM100L is not nearly as durable wires are thin delicate and prone to breaking If I was the only one using the CM100L it would probably last for many years But students are rough and cant stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after theyre finished although I ask them not to The wire gets stressed at the mic clip andor plug and shorts out I burn through one or two CM100L per semester I found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire electrical tape is uselessGreat product easy to use and makes tuning in a room full of guitars a snap Wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables Works great but wires are delicate,positive
For those of you going for the folk singer look or if youre afraid of drilling holes in your guitar this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar Just what you needed,positive

To describe my impressions of the TH2000S versus my wellused Sennheiser HD201s I chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values I like to use recordings I know well so I can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarityAndres Segovia Variations on a Spanish Folk Tune Narvaez from My Favorite Spanish EncoresIn my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar Ive ever heard both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound The distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that Segovias arrangement of the original vihuelatexture really emphasize For me theres a difference between bass presence and bass clarity Ill gladly trade less oomph in the gut for the kind of definition the Tascams bring out warm welldefined with a crisp and clear treble edge The Sennheisers while equally balanced were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top They were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board the TH2000S just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settingsJeff Beck You Know What I Mean from Blow By BlowThe George Martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made The clean separation and space in the mix between guitar electric piano clavinet bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system The TH2000s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the Sennheisers and overall more presence Its a 24bit recording and this is the first time I can honestly say I hear the difference like being there in the control room seriously Theres a greyness to the Sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before but after hearing the Tascam phones I doubt Ill ever be satisfied with less againStravinsky Violin Concerto Anne Sophie Mutter from Mutter ModernThe words I keep coming back to are presence and clarity I can hear string attacks counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the TH2000S that I simply dont hear with the Sennheiser phonesAs far as craftsmanship the TH2000S weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups The sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually The cup mounts are really welldesigned and allow finegrained 4way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears I like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head The 23 cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfortThe cord is a hybrid the 23 closest to the phones is flat 18 diameter wellinsulated mattefinish and flexible Beyond that theres another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another 34 feet I think its a nice compromise thats probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need toAs we get older our hearing changes for most people its a decrease in highfrequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum Simply listening louder isnt always the best solution and it can be a tremendous earopening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones Id encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these Tascam TH2000S are a good place to start Feel and Sound Like the Real Deal,positive
I use the Dunlop 60mm nylon picks as my current standard but decided to give the lighter 38mm a try Unfortunately the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar especially in an outdoor picnic setting and basically unusable for that purpose However I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice allowing me to hear a metronome or backtrack far easier So although they failed my original performance intention 5 stars for filling a need I didnt even know I had 38mm picks,positive
Great deal for the price and very sturdily made Easy to assemble and feels solid Recommend this if youre tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music Very nice,positive
I bought this just to see what everyone was raving aboutIts all trueThis tuner works greatIt is better than my Intelli 600 which I also likeThe colors and lighting make it very easy to readIt has no problem with the low E string Obviously more sensitiveThe Intelli works but sometimes you have to move it around to find a sweet spot for the low EAs with the Intelli it is not affected by ambient noiseThe only thing I find worse than the Intelli is the gooseneck While it is very adjustable the Intell folds flat which I really likeThe Snark is well worth its small price I love it,positive
I had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought I was doing a good job After I used the Snark my guitar sounds so much better I will never be without one again The snark is easy to use and shows you positively when the guitar is in tune Great little tuner,positive

good pedalthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityI like the sound it is very goodI have 3 pedals and the pedalboard behringer thank you for this product good pedal,positive
These come with two Velcro straps to hold the cable in a bundle which is convenient I use this for a microphone and it seems to be solidlybuilt If I need more Ill probably buy this again Works fine,positive
I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it I needed a 1234 wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe to the microphone plug on the Video CameraThe wire on this thing is not 1 foot long the actual wire is under 834 long itself I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasnt worth the hassle Id have rated it 1 star but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike and it worked out ok Still a tight fit though since theres only 834 of wireId recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2 adapter worst case scenario you can ziptie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesnt fitAlso not sure if its the wire so this didnt affect stars but I hear a hiss when recording Again unsure if its the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not or my shotgun mic Measure your damned wires before sending them,negative
This is an intriguing idea for a microphone a nice condenser with builtin monitoring A possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal It seemed to me that I should test it both as a microphone and as a USB IO device The very first appearance is impressive Theres a nicelycompartmentalized carrying case Inside theres a milled aluminum desk stand a cable a short manual and the microphone No shock mount The mic looks good but has almost no mass While this may not mean much I own and have used lots of micsnone of them this lacking in heftI set up a shootout in my studio I have an acousticallytreated room with calibrated studio monitors so I think I can do a fair test I kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles For a comparison mic I used an AKG Perception 420 This is a multipattern mic thats only a little more expensive a cardiodonly version is exactly the same price as this MXL I used only the cardiod pattern so I think its a fair comparison on the basis of price To get to the point the AKG beat the MXL in every way It was quieter with a much better midrange A glance at the specs online at MXL shows a significant boost in higher frequencies leading to about a 3dB rise at 8K or so The polar pattern is shown only in broadband not at multiple frequencies and it shows a dip at the 45degree position These were things I could easily hearSo purely as a microphone the MXL doesnt match up to other mics in its price range But thats not a complete comparison The MXL has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency Thats a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses The mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cablebetter make sure you hold still when you use it Theres also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level This means that its easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when youre mounting the mic or tweaking your listening levelTheres also an optional software control panel Mac and Windows that goes with the mic It provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring Im unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it cant be undone Id apply those after the fact when Ive got plenty of time to dial them in This leaves the level controlsa place where MXL could have been more careful Theres a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself It takes some doing to figure out which does what Theres a highpass filtertremendously useful when rumble is a problem But we dont know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain I hope its analog but theres nothing about it in the documentation Then theres the biggest problem Theres a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mics headphone jack But this also means thatdepending on your DAWits easy to set up a feedback path You wont like thatThe biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for A traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate I have mics both expensive and inexpensive that Ive had for years and years Only the preampinterface changes This MXL is USBonly 4448 only You cant easily set up multiples of USB mics without clocking issues Most USBFIrewire mic preamps have a zerolatency monitoring mode so the mic doesnt really offer anything you cant get elsewhere In the end I dont really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians To me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer If youre a podcaster or a serious Skyper then this mic deserves consideration Its a decent mic for spoken voicethe HF boost is helpful in bringing out articulationand the single USB connection keeps your desk uncluttered Of course there are plenty of other choices for that application But I think thats the best light to shine on this one Almost,neutral
As good as advertizedRugged and sturdyLive up to expectations and is comfortableI would definitely buy a few more of these Rugged and Sturdy,positive
These are my favorite guitar strings They are very longlasting and sound greatI would recommend these for anyone beginners or even people who play seriously or perform They are very good strings worth the cost Great,positive
Yes these strings are amazing I discovered these on my new Taylor and now Ive put them on all my gits They really are the better string I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and DAddario on my acoustics but no more Im only using these They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics They do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other stringsbut its worth it These will make your git sound like something its never sounded like before,positive
I really like these strings because I have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast I can play a guitar once and leave it there for 23 weeks and the strings will be rusty and nasty when I return to it I now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them but this stil happensThen I happened across these Elixir nanowebs They are great I no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly and they stay rust and gunkfree for 2 weeks of regular playing However I did encounter one strange thing While playing at a rehearsal my Estring just popped and broke hurting my finger a bit I was surprised because outwardly the string didnt look that badSo that is the downside With regular strings you can tell the string is near the end of its life bc it looks really bad With these they may still look okay but be close to breaking Made me a little cautiousI still prefer these 100 over other strings though Very good Hard to know when to change them,positive
Let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal and TONS of fun I can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used liveBUT and this is a big but this is my first one star review everMy first lessthan5starreview eversame as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it used less than ten times total light use at home I wasnt even wearing shoes By the way a giggingrecording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff Bummer too GREAT ideapoorly executedI will not buy anther one I will not recommend to other musicians Do not buy,negative
After online research I decided to buy and found locally this midi pad to use in Reason 4 Although not confirmed online as working with Reason I was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems My CPU is Windows 7 but it worked on my MSI netbook also This unit also worked in Ableton Live as stated online I would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs Portable Responsive and Affordable,positive
This pedal makes my Les Paul sing Better than I imagined even with all the good reviews Such a wide range of sounds warm jazzy boost great blues overdrive and almost some Black Sabbath distortion Makes my crappy Behringer amp sound almost good Great,positive
These are your basic speaker stands for PA systemstheyre functional durable and can be setup within just a few seconds I would have given this a higher rating however upon receipt one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight I had set the tension While inspecting the bag I found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand Further inspection confirmed this as this block was indeed part of the tube and after several minutes of wrestling with it I was able to get it lodged back inside The block was part of the tension 34mechanism34 and once it was forced back into the tube the stands performed flawlessly Decent Speaker Stands,positive
Maybe they included some sticky pads and I missed it This thing is great in theory but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesnt have a guitar resting in itIt does well at its job when its in use ie it doesnt fall when theres a guitar but I think Ill use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while its lying in wait Falls off desk too easily,neutral
Yes its cheap plastic Yes the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours Yes the battery is difficult to replace However this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet I solved the battery problem by using a 1Spot 8outlet pedal power supply It doesnt sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest Everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here and it all sounds great It even has a modulated reverb which is a reverb with a slight flangechorus affecting the reverb signal only not the dry signal which is their version of the Holy Grails Flerb setting This is about 13 the cost of the Holy Grail and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use unless of course you are an elephant For all the complaining I hear about this and other pedals with cheap plastic cases I have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it Behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit Decent Reverb For A Great Price,positive
This is a very comfortable strap Because it is cotton this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps It fits the guitar perfect and is easy to adjust Well made and you cant beat the price Nice Comfortable Strap,positive
This pedal used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board The Labyrinth does what it claims to do and more It seriously boosts the instrument signal from my Tele at a mere 50 level setting and makes the subsequent MXR Distortion pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain Ive purchased a host of Behringer guitar pedals during the last year used I might add and am happy with every single one of them Dont let the cheap price fool ya Ive been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970s yes Im old and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer Im just glad that Im getting most of them for under 50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and Behringer jacks the price of everything Oh yes I use a OneSpot 9v multiadapter to power everything so I cannot comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries GOOD STUFF POWERFUL,positive
Little to say about this incredible little stomp box no color on your sound build like a tank large display perfect for those smelly and dark bars and joints where all musicians play and it has KORG brand printedand for me thats enough to trust this great tunnerCheers Perfect,positive
We bought this Mic and a spare for our sons guitar amp setup for his mixer It seems to work fine and comes with the Mic cord We decided to go for the model with the onoff switch based on other reviews and havent yet been disappointed Excellent Allpurpose Mic,positive
I started using the confetti picks years ago when I used to occasionally drop my pick No matter what color the floorcarpetstage is you can find your pick easily No lost picksI like the extra heavy picks They suit my playing style well I dont have to wait for it to snap back It doesnt bend They dont break either although they do wear down over timeKMC Music Inc shipped fast and I got free shipping When I buy a gross I only need to buy picks about once every 7 yearsI would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick Thank you KMC Music Inc for fast shipping Easy to find if you drop it,positive
Ive been playing for 8 years and I own 4 electric guitars All of my guitars are strung with DAddario 10s They sound great when theyre fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest I play at least 1520 hours per week so I put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings Its really the durability that sets these apartThe Amazon price is terrific I like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and I can buy a years worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings Id definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through Amazon My favorite electric guitar strings,positive
Firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick They are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold I can play all night without dropping it My favorite pick,positive
I had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so I had to get another for my acoustic Super simple to install and very sturdy once installed Great sturdy guitar hanger,positive
A friend of my has one and I just found in love with it Great sound Beautiful color The Applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified Great soud,positive
Need a little variety in your life well Its nice never having to look for a pick theyre just always around now Every pick youll ever need,positive
If you thought a pick is a pick like I once did long ago you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack andor complexityI use the Dunlop Tortex 114mm PurplesEarly on in my playing I was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better Why After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibilityI tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid 80sI like the Dunlops feel grip and durability They hold up for a very long time How long I have had some last a few years They are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durabilityMy students use them too I dont demand it but I do stress the control aspects with picks of different gaugesHighly recommended You wont be disappointed Quality,positive
I was looking for a decent capo found this and have been using for months without a problem Cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist Will Last Will Hold,positive
Ive used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother the jazz 3 XL Same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor I would definitely recommend the XL version if rhythmlead work is required For strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better Nice pick but try the XL,neutral
nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad it serves its purpose and is simple which i cannot complain about it works,positive
would buy again works great built good steady strong I bought 5 of these total from diff dealers all do great good fast pleased,positive
I bought this since I am a new guitar playerIt does hit the frets but doesnt seem to do any damagePretty easy to useThe only oddity I have is that the box was kind of open already when I bougt it newDoes the job String cleaner does the job,positive
I will let you know that Ive been using boom stands for 35 years and that I write this so you can make an informed decision Im loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through collegeI see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good I particularly dont think the horizontal axis point is very good I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom Its a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that youre trying to figure how to keep it from drooping the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until somethings got to give The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and Id predict someday youll be going from duct tape to replacing it I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses The boom in general isnt a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isnt telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight so youre mainly purchasing the stand On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom StandJust like you cant compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup this one is so inexpensive too inexpensive that price comparisons arent whats important so looking at Amazon today Id probably buy the 9700MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Standor this oneDR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boomor maybe try this oneHosa MSB521BK Mic Stand with BoomI havent tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products Id be inclined to give it a try I think youll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice Id pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because youll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long theyve been using it but love how inexpensive it is Ignore that it doesnt come with a mic clip because usually they dont clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced so plan on putting weight on a leg if youre using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money 100 will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight like whats used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination As for the cheap cord clips just forget them and buy these theyll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent no leftover duct tape glueVelcro Reusable SelfGripping TiesBut understand my position Ive got stands purchased 20 years ago that I can still use and dont feel the lowest price is always the best value but youre intelligent so you know an 80 stand used for 20 years is 4year I use stands almost everyday and I dont think this would last me a year and maybe only months But if1 You dont care about a telescoping boom and2 You dont plan to adjust it much and3 You use a average weight mic or4 Youre alright with replacing the boom when neededThis stand could be fine for you now if you cant budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some I did give it 3 stars but 2 are for the product and 1 is for the price So I hope all of this helps you with your decisionIve now purchased and reviewed theOn Stage 9701Band recommend checking it out Things To Think About,neutral
No complaints about this hardware Easy to install with patience easy to use The click onoff system securely holds your strap and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the postThese work like a light switchonoff so Im not sure how you can rate them as poor There arent really any directions so it takes a little mechanical knowledge just a littleits not rocket science to make them workQuality metal secure function and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap postsIve installed these on a 34 Hoener Full Sized Squire Acoustic and 2 Fender Strats Simple easy to install,positive
For the price I got a little more than expected The sound is pretty great The scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound Other than that your can change amount of distortion Its cheap and maybe it doesnt have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot But for the price this is one hell of a deal Quality itemOnly complaints are its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something But thats expected and not that big of a deal if youre careful Now the one issue I really have with this pedal its cosmetic so its not worth 4starring this review but it did get to me The knobs They are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures They are black plastic ones They look sorta bland and not as cool but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet Still a great product though It does as its supposed to,positive
it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp it works,positive
My bassplaying has gone on for 50 yearsand during the time Ive tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars I know from that experience how the quality and construction of strings has improved over the decadesThis set of DAddario chromes is remarkable Its a flat wound string with all the smoothness and quiet character found in that string type In this set I especially like the 4th string at 10034 dia This set by its design gives a very strong and powerful signal to the ampand therefore makes even my Schecter Diamond Series 4string sound largely like the early Pbass with bottom to spare Theres a however and this is itthis string is NOT muddy sounding like many flat wounds Clean bold and full of smooth overtones that work well I really like them The price is fair and well see what kind of life they exhibit as I dont want to be spending lots of hardtofind cash on new strings at a frequency that is aggravatingDon P Just the string type for me,positive
I went with this over road runner because of the pouch designs which i like better because they are square Unfortunately I think the Roadrunner is better quality thicker material Very nice,positive
This amp really surprized me Its made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great There is a headphone jack which is why I bought itI would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether But over all this amp is a most welcome deal No transistor amp I own sounds as good but I would suggest pedals Great little tube amp,positive
I must have had over 20 tuners in the last few decades and the Snark is by far my favorite I change out altered capos every few songs so I have to tweak the tuning many times each gig and this has made it much easier even in noisy clubs with poor lighting I love these things,positive
This is an always on pedal for meIts at the end of my pedal board right before the BBEIt really allowed me to wake up the board and I like the fact that I can adjust it on the fly if I dont totally agree with my tone that nightVery nice built like a brick every guitarist and bassist needs one of these whether you run a pedal board or not Awesomeness,positive
I play guitar and bass but the gitpicker in me envies fulltime bassists because they almost never break strings and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings The price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics You dont know how good youve got it And these DAds are very good allround strings though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even normal nickel wound so theyre not for sloppy fingersVery nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge these FlexSteels ring nicely and I like that the bottom E is a tad thicker at 105 than the usual light sets 100 Because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice And Im a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that But if youre popping and slapping these come through loud and clear I really like the feel of the low E when I thumb pop with theseI play a Pbass with my index middle and thumb and these punch nicely at that scale length The pickups also like them and they get plenty loud with full definition and plenty of top end but not brittle With a Trace Elliot or other highdef amp these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players I bet Marcus would kill with themI think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles Obviously flats are better for jazz but these make a good allaround string and for less than 20 clams theyre a great deal You lucky basstards,positive
This portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone Its way louder than a 9volt Fender mini Twin which actually does incorporate two speakers however when you dial in the gain all the way you get a crunch rather than full on distortion It comes included with a 9volt and is compatible with most negative tip power adapters make sure its 300mA like the Planetwaves adapter for 900 At 2000 this amp is a deal great mini amp for clean tones,positive
I have to admit I have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my Strats But this pedal gives me everything that I wantThe best way that I can describe the sound of the OCD is Quality and CharacterAs a Clean DriveWhen you uses this pedal with less drive as a clean boost for your tube amp you will notice that it delivers a very strong character from your guitar and is very sensitive to your dynamics while playingAs an OverdriveI have loved the Ibanez TS9 because it allows a strat to keep a vocal type of midrange while having singing trebles When you add drive to the TS9 it retains those characteristics which is why it is the industry standard for strat guitarists who want to keep their stratty character and get the quality sound of a tube ampThe reason why the OCD is my preferred pedal over the TS9 is that it does not let the low end distort as early The TS9 allows you lower notes to distort earlier and seems to then amplify the signal The OCD gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone If you like blues or hard rock you will notice that this feature is exactly what you wanted to give your playing a really strong character You gain boldness and when your low end does gain some crunch it is the biggest baddest tone that you could dream ofI use this pedal with my HSS strat and through a blues Jr III and use the clean boost for the coolest clean tone ever It allows your playing dynamics to drive the amp not some arbitrary clipping from your pedal When I am playing heavier blues or rock stuff I just turn up the drive and have the boldest and highest quality sound that I have ever played withThe HPLP switchShifting into HP is almost like a gain boost I have heard it described as switching from an American Fendery sound LP to a British Marshally sound HP I guess this is a decent description I have found that I get a thick ballsy sound in the LP and I dont lose any quality in the HP It feels like you get a boost in your midrangeTo conclude I would have to say that this pedal is the perfect mix of ballsy overdrive with quality tone If you have a quality amp and a quality guitar there is no reason to try and save 30 by buying an Ibanez TS9 or TS808 or TS9dx This pedal will make you a lot happier than those will if you like to keep your low end intact and not allow it to break up too early making it whimpy My FAVORITE for STRATS,positive
This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal partBroken OKI bought it on sale and returning it would not be an optionit would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy itObviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the boxOf courseI could not recommend this product to anyonemost disappointing purchase Damaged Goods,negative
For 30 bucks this mic is great I have garage band and needed a mic for voice and room recording well this mic does it and them some The different modes are distinct and perfect from podcast to vocals and for room jams It comes with a long cable rotating bad and a nice carry case that fits in my pocket BUY this mic for 30bucks you willbe surprised Very good,positive
I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics The old stand by,positive
I thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they wont slip around maybe i should get that for cheaperI accidently bought LARGE ooh boy is it like windshield sun reflector size Sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose Guess i just sorta bought it blind,negative
Changing strings on a 12 string less often Fantastic And the sound is good I didnt expect this much volume from light strings The tone of the strings lasts about 4 months in my experience but that will depend on how much playing you get in Great purchase,positive
Best inexpensive right angle cables out there I use these in my lesson room at the music store that I teach at They will last forever if you take care of them These work great and very inexpensive,positive
I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago and have always loved it I only use 34 pedals and this is always one of them It sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space The controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds I have played boutique chorus pedals and the Boss is loads better in every way You will not regret this purchaseProseasy to useno humsmallsonds awesomeindestructabeconsNONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever will last forever and sounds incredible get this What a Boss,positive

Pretty basic strap but durable and works for me The only thing I noticed is I think that one of the end pieces was attached with the stitching on the wrong side but its just a picky detail Works for me,positive
I own several ElectroHarmonix pedals and overall I like the brand even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his YouTube videos Of those I own two of them are the smaller versions of the GIGANTOR classic EH pedals one of them being the Little Big MuffFirst of all if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz overdrive and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything These effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do Do some research by looking on YouTube looking at Dave Hunters book on effects and testing them out at a storeIf you are looking for a basic fuzz box the Little Big Muff will give you nice sound similar to if not the same as that of the Big Muff Pi depending on the exact yearmodel you have I think the tone is great but as with most basic fuzz boxes there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them It is simple to use though and it makes a lot of noiseAs a bonus these dont take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the Big Muff Pi yet will give the same tone It is great for punk alt rockgrunge and classic hard rock like Hendrix and Black SabbathI also have a germanium red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini another good small version of one of the classics and the Fuzz Face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three the blue silicon and aqua Hendrix models boost treble more To quickly compare it to the Little Big Muff regarding sound the Fuzz Face does not have a tone control but I think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation While the Little Big Muff will give you more control over the tone EQ like many EHX pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly In this case when you begin turning the Sustain it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone As you increase the amount of saturation you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same So Id say while both the red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini the Little Big Muff are good tools each comes with its own disadvantagesThough some EH units come with power supply this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries Although few pedals come with power supplies I think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unitIf you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industriallooking Little Big Muff I like pretty things but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kitBottom line1 Gives the classic Big Muff fuzz sound2 Does not eat up pedalboard space like the old GIGANTOR models3 Noisy not always in a good way when on but has true bypass when off4 Has tone control EQ but the Sustain saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control limits dynamic control of your picking4 Simple to use but limited sound palette5 Decent price but power supply sold separately6 Bleak appearance not shiny colorful or sparkly Classic fuzz compact size,positive
This works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me but I see that most are the same As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring Just pop filtering through black pantyhose lol Works Like A Charm,positive
Love these picks Have used them for years Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever Highly recommend Tortex Picks,positive
This shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick I sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heartshaped Fender pick The stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string Good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead More area for for a good grip,positive
This device has really help me I am new at trying to learn I have a long way to go Good Transaction,positive
From the product description I expected something far more robust than this unit By and large Ive had great experiences with Behringer pedals but this reverb unit is the wimpiest I have ever used in 40 years of playing no stronger than the reverb in a 5w First Act amplifier Limp,negative
For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky bitey blues material think Albert Collins this will likely add a little and I mean A LITTLE extra oomph to your sound It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp too just running it straightTo me from what I have heard it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music It definitely doesnt add any more fatness So my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased Vitamin E regimen In other words this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you areMost musicians already use EQ and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think youre getting out of this pedal I think The Placebo Box,neutral
These arent my first set I cant count the amount of Monster 14 cables I bought and own None has ever failed me so far Highly recommend these I love how they sound and they are built well Great Product,positive
Saw this sucker on my bass players head and got one a few days later Not pitch perfect on the fly but keeps you very close when on the run Unbeatable value Silent tuning so on stage its almost a must Just what you need,positive
My father is a fulltime gigging musician primarily on Steel Guitar and Telecaster He has been playing over 50 years and it takes a lot to get him interested in new strings We both use DAddario strings almost exclusively myself on bass guitar and him on the electric These are outstanding strings with great durability playability and exceptional sound They remain in tune for long gigs or recording sessions they generate less fret noise than comparable strings and have a brightcrisp sound that really stands out Well worth the extra investment Highly recommended Great for pickin on the Tele or almost anything else,positive
I love the Elixir strings They sound great and play easy I would recommend them to anyone Give them a try Great strings,positive
I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up The screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that I got are holding guitars to the wall on drywall nonetheless So given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem They all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers best deal and does the job Helped Me Clean Up My Room,positive
To me this is a pick to pick notes and leads It does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much I use light or medium regular size picks for strumming I really like the fitfeel of this plucking pick Smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings You might balk at the price but I do not regret it in the least Some nice picking with this pick I dont play a lot so I figured 6 ought to last me quite a while I have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too But the Dunlop is better to me A pickers delight,positive
First things first If you have one or many expensive guitars BUY THESE They keep you guitar safe from falling To take it off all you do is hold down a button in the side and your strap and the lock with pop off Its very handy Very very easy to install and protects Be warned they are bigger than they look but to do what they do so well they must be big So good I bought two pair,positive
to much string for my beginner fingers but seemed to be the real brand and a decent pricei would reorder in 9s or maybe even 10s next time ended up being to big for me,positive
This is not a bad product just not great As soon as I received it I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar and played with it for over two hours Installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes My problems with it are 3 fold 1 Sounds just a bit tinny too much on the high end and not an equal amount of bass 2 A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries and I couldnt get mine to work in passive mode 3 And the biggest complaint is that the volume control is difficult to get to when youre performing on stage You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft Like I said it is not a bad product just not top notch and definitely not for professionals If youre just fooling around at home or recording at home it is fine and will do the job for you BUT If youre a pro youll want to spend double the money and get an L R Baggs M80 The M80 gives you the truest sound unbelievable works in passive mode and is very easy to change the volume control Sincerely Doc Not Bad,neutral
This neat little tuner has it all It is cheap to buy at Amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning Unlike some of my tuners this one picks up all the notes easily and gives a smooth and accurate reading I love the way it folds flat so I can get my instruments in the case with it still clamped on I keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times There is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it Its a must have It was only about 15 at Amazon and worth many times that amount FANTASTIC,positive
I have used the EXL115W set for years Nice to have the whole set again Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third and then have to find the wound third in a single string Not fun I like the sound of the wound third I play a thin hollowbody electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers No more thick calouses on the fingers Playing weekinds and practicing they last a long time with the same sound quality Love these strings,positive
Ive been using National medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke Decided to try the Dunlop Overall Im very pleased with this pickPrevious reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the National mediums This is true but isnt a complete description Basically the National picks are much more elongated so while the nail to thumbpad distance is about the same on both the across nail distance is much greater on the National picks I actually find the Dunlop pick to fit much better and I dont get extra overhang as with the National which tends to catch the string A step up,positive
Does its job extremely well produces high quality audio and is fantastic for recording your microphone or guitar or what have you without any fuzz or latency Its built like a tank and its nice and solid This interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint Fantastic and simple audio interface,positive

nice cable could be a little heavier I managed to pull the wires apart on the straight plug probably stepped on the cord when I was playing guitar while standing I had to take it apart and resolder but it has been really good since works great,neutral
If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone this one works well It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk Having the microphone always plugged in accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voiceover work Solid Build,positive

Im an acoustic player but every once in a while I break out the Strat just to have some fun and get a little variety I wanted to get some of the cool 70s fuzz going just to play around and experiment For me this pedal was a great way to do thatWith electric guitar Im not a tone freak and I dont need everything to sound 100 authentic For me this pedal gets you 80 of the way there It has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controlsIf youre comparing this to 80 Boss fuzz pedal this one is probaly a lower build quality eg made from plastic but its also only 25 Im not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage so Ill gladly take the savings Great value,positive
Nice strap for the price Looks nice and quality seems nice Like the pic holder on front of the strap its good,positive
Bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me I grew up playing without picks when playing fingerstyle and the transition to wearing picks was not going well I can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail These are working a lot better for me Great product,positive

This is one beefy string winder There is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy 2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstorePros VERY sturdy Rotates extremely smoothly Well balanced Fits every guitar tuning key Ive tried Highimpact plastic body should withstand years decades of abuse Clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus for earplugs extra end pins whateverCons None whatsoeverBuy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits Does the trick and worth every penny,positive
People complain that these arent really rolling string trees despite the fact that the description never says or even implies they are in fact rolling string trees Honestly they dont need to be at least for most guitars These small round guides are superior to the flat wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings Less contact means less friction less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings dont have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they moveI put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut those are still the cheap stock partsIf you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot rollers might be a little better but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade anyone can change them all you need is a screwdriver it was a no brainer for my Telecaster Dont NEED rollers on most guitars,positive
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine Does not leave streaks if used properly This dries quickly every time great finish,positive
OK I like this one a lot It stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime It is accurate easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing It sure beats the other units I have used where you clamp on some weird thing tune up and then stash back in your gig bagThis one is bing on tune and back to playing It weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up Nice compact accurate,positive
I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period Generously Ill give it 2stars Something like this really should last at least a year or more Cheap partsmanufacturing 50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature Something like this really should last at least a year or,negative
I use this pedal mainly for the 34church34 setting in ambient volume swells It has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse So it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for It is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others wont I like it That said I have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well They sound good and are affordable great reverb,positive
I have used a few different capos this is far and away my favorite Very easy to take it off holds the strings tight What more can you ask for Does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive Great Capo,positive
Hard to believe this was so bad I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap which is a dream and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap However it is so thick that it cant really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap and when I tried to lock it the two pieces came apart Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps Fell apart,negative
Ive only recently heard of Joyo pedals and thats because Amazoncom kept recommending them to me I normally stick with BOSS pedals they sound good and theyre all the same size so theyre easy to set upmaintain This pedal was priced very well 32 and had nearly a 5 star rating I used to have a BOSS Phaser I dont recall which number off the top of my head It was a pretty complex little pedal and sounded great but I needed money and sold it When I saw this pop up in my Amazon I got curious did some research and decided it would be a wise investment Sure enough it was Its obviously simple to use having one knob and all Over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made Based on this experience Im very much interested in checking out their chorus flanger and overdrive pedalsI highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive simple yet wellmade and great sounding phaser Swirly fun,positive
This is a great pedal I picked up used they can be had cheaply on the used market I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile enough to use with a cigar box guitar alsoThe pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQd for saturated distortion The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular I also other Boss Distortion pedals Like most people I own a DS1 and an MD2 which are both cheap and effective I own a HM2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal toneI also own an older 80s HM2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with overall i like this pedal but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals Versatile pedal for distortion but not the best,positive
i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitarbut all in all I will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort It looks and feels great on my Luna Butterflyand I like the durability it seems like it will have Pretty great strap overall and I am very very much pleased with my purchase all smiles here it looks great,positive
I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and AL Ami I use the DAddario custom lights I have grown a fondness for the Phosphor Bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking ALso the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys Ive tried such as Martins and Elixirs These strings are quite durable and longlasting In the 10 years Ive been playing Ive never had these strings break on me Ive broken Martin and Elixir strings in the past The colorcoded end balls help with the restringing I typically get the threepack so I can restring a trio set of my herd at a time I really cant complain about anythingThe individual gauges are 012 016 024w 032w 042w 053wHighly recommended Great strings,positive
I was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garagebandThis product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the 1434 port the product specs does not show or say 14 plug portMy product has an orange USB light instead of a blue one The support people at Behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo sounds like BS to meThe problem I had and the reason I bought this is that I tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a 1418 adapter chord It works but the levels are too low When I received this I was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are but not by much It is a step up from the adapter but far from professional Id say the level is beginnerintro level sound and qualityI bought a 34like new34 product describing faded or damaged packaging When it arrived the pkg box was dented I dont care and product looked new inside But all the instructions described a blue USB light and CD of driver and recording software which this did not come with Behringer gave me a link to download I assure you its crapware and beware For the mac garageband is far better and easier to useRock out For garageband on imac,neutral
For the money this is a tremendous pedal The next step up might be the new MXR Bonamassa tube pedal but that is almost double the price By the way Bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one maybe the maxon made version I doubt there is that much difference Very well made and useable and effective tone controls unlike other pedals that I find only click in at the ends of the adjustments and the middle area is modest It is great and I kinda like the great look You really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit It has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks What can I say it is fantastic,positive
I installed these pins in my Silvertone SD10 They fit great and are a lot better than the cheap plastic ones that were in it If you have a lower end guitar I highly recommend these pins The saddle will make a bigger difference in sound than the pins but every little bit helps For the cost you cant beat it Great Bridge Pins,positive

I purchased this pickholder for my son who has a nasty habit of leaving things in places they dont belong The holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find Best purchase I have made Guitar pickholder,positive
Ive tried several different strings on electric and Ernie Ball Slinkys are the only ones I really trust on all of my guitars The fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus But they sound great and are far less prone to breakage than other brands I have tried The 9s are super fast and easy to bend but Ive started using 10s more often on my Strats which creates an even more robust sound Theyre an industry standard for a reason you dont need 15 dollar strings The ONLY strings I will use,positive
Ive had this pedal for over a year now and Ive been getting more and more into tube amps and Ive learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together amps guitars and pedalsWhen I first reviewed this pedal I had just gotten a new solid state amp and I was very let down After I jumped to tube amps I grew to appreciate it a little bit more but I was using it wrong Id just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a 2nd channelgain stage I thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing but I dismissed it as just an OK boxFlash forward This thing kills It belongs in front of a tube amp period Ive found as all before me that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state ampsThe D III works very well as a clean boost Max the volume set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back This will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone This is my preferred setting as I can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like I would before using it as a second channel but with that natural tube sound Any pedal that gives you some more umph without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thingDial the output down some and crank the volume on the amp a bit more the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone I found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer while not tonally identical this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy heavy tones while retaining the sound of the amps natural distortionIn between you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive After playing around with the knobs I found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal I actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as thats been done to death the D III is conceptually the same but it just sounds different that the TS and it doesnt let go of the low endFor the price this is a fantastic buy It delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost and theres enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone youd want save for modern high gain metal Great distortion box fairly versatile,positive
I have an ESP guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when I got the guitar After buying a line6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bagFound this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear cables etc I originally put it on my wish list because I will admit you dont always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surpriseMy guitar fits perfectly It used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut As mentioned the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not closeBut this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag And the pockets OH THE POCKETS They fit ALL of my gear I have my guitar cable a set of full size sennheiser headphones a line 6 pocket pod all the allen wrenches a tuner and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets And there is room for more if I need itThe bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didnt stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned Just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it wont bother anyone and its fine after a day or twoOne last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock I did not know this but wow I had no idea how useful that could be I tend to carry my guitar in bag up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful Then you have the backpack handles as an option as well I really cannot recommend this bag enough I do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like but I dont really care the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that and while the padding is great I would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel It would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage in case you want it for that kind of thing I dont travel long distances with my guitar but if I did I would use a hard case only for that as I have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines latelyHope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear Perfect Bag for Me,positive

Well long story short this is my fourth Vox wah Others have come and gone some have been around longer than others but this one is the newest so im still working with it sounds like the classic v847 but has the ac plug on it that will come in handy not as versatile as the JS big bad wah but far less complex and less likely to have issues with dust and dirt it has a wide sweep and killer tone but im still looking for that sweet spot that gives that waho sound when doing solo work so far so good not perfect but good Same old Vox,positive

I was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets The action is better than my six string Epiphone acoustic It sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet I keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck I would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget It stays in tune and dont let the laminated top scare you its great Wow,positive
I love my Snark SN5 tuner It works smoothly without any issues and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock and it is ready to go The SN5 is smaller than I expected but the multicolored meter is easily readable and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any positionUsing the color coded meter you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp and adjust the string tension accordingly With a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process The unit is powered by a CR 2032 battery which generally has a long lifeAlthough the clamp has rubber pads apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage The instructions states that the Snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes polyurethane French polish and nitrocellulose lacquer Those with Gibson Gretch or Taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning I have had no problems using this tuner on Kramer Ibanez Charvel Epiphone and ESP guitars The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins I do not have either of those instruments but I imagine the tuner would work much the sameAs there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock it took me a little while to decide on the SN5 Even after eliminating tuners by DAddario and Planet Waves selecting the SN5 wasnt that simple as Snark makes a number of similar tuners I am completely satisfied with the SN5 and believe that it fully deserves a 5 star rating It is also the least expensive of the tuners I was considering buying If the finish of your guitar isnt an issue you may find the Snark to be very helpful compact and inexpensive the Snark SN5 is terrific if you have the right kind of finish,positive

This product has a monomicrophone input and a stereo headphone output It is meant for connecting a headset to a USB port Since the headset has a monomicrophone this adapter works great The drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems This product is great for using a softphone or other communications program The windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected I imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this but it was mainly built for a headset Works seemless and great with a headset ships as expected,positive

I ordered one of these bad boys on a whim Its definitely the best verb its price range You can dial in some pretty lush tonesIt has a 3 way toggle that changes it from hall spring and room verbsThered is also an ab switch that is almost a tone mode A is bright and in your face and B is very lush and ambientUsing these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverbAlso has a blend knob which controls wet and dry signal mix and time knob that controls you guessed it reverb time and amountVery versatileThis pedal is built with great construction though the first one I received was faulty All sorts of popping and weird stuff going onThe 2nd one works flawlessly Seems very durable switch and jacks are qualityI highly recommend getting a 1spot or 9v adapter bc this thing drains batter power FAST though all modulation pedals doThis pedal does not suck tone and is true bypass though I wish this wasnt as I wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned offFor lt 75 shipped I certainly cant complainIf you have any hesitations on the Biyang stuff I definitely recommend it Pretty good reverb pedal,positive
These screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older Epiphone by Gibson S900 that I opted to add a pick guard too the screws fit everything perfectly The look of the screws was even better than the cheap one you find on most import and low end made guitars the have the fat heads and strip really easy I will purchase again for my next build Fender Pickguard Screws,positive
This is a decent pop filter It gets the job done but it has a few flaws It attracts a good amount of dust the screen tends to mess up which caused me to tear the first screen the goose neck tends to unwrap its self out of place It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in Other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price Under 10 wouldve been better I should have went with something cheaper than 20 cough cough the Auphonix pop filter cough cough but I will in the future It gets the job done Thats what matters right Aha,neutral

Works great for the price I just started to get into pedals and I thought Id try something cheap like this and I was not dissatisfied Dont mistake this for a distortion pedal for those who are new to all this although you can get a distorted tone for this pedal it just boosts the volume with slight raise in gain For those who do know your shit please dont call me out on that I dont really know and Im just helping ones like me in simple termslol It works great for switching to a more abrasive tone for soloing or just wanting to get loud in your songsDefinitely would pick this one up for a super cheap 34I just wanna try it34 pedal Danelectro is alright,positive

It is simple accurate takes up very little room and has several modes that are nicely backlight To top it all off its about half the price of any other pedal tuner Korg king of the practical tuner world I love this tuner,positive
In 40 years I have had every kind of capo out there This is the right one This one works Buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case they are well made and inexpensive enough Last one you will ever need,positive
This is great if you have to put your guitar down but dont want to put it in its case I use it all the time,positive
As a disclaimer I am not a Big Muff connoisseur Ive never owned one before this I also tend not to like fuzz as an effect Id characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz maintaining enough definition for chord work If youre reading the reviews youve probably already done your research on the features but Ill cover them anywayThree simple controls Volume Tone Sustain with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control The enclosure is a smaller pedalboardfriendly size The pedal incorporates two of the supposedly most popular Big Muff mods with switches Tone and Wicker When Tone is switched off the Tone control and its toneshaping circuitry are completely disconnected In this mode the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly and it also produces a significant volume boost The Tone knob does nothingWhen Wicker is switched on it removes three highfrequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher with a highend frequency boostI use this pedal running into a mild overdrive the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret which conditions the signal I play with the Tone off and Wicker on and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low this combination results in a wonderfully thick massive distorted tone that is still pretty smoothIf youre looking to get a Big Muff and youre not a snob about which version the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound Not to mention that at this price point it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs Highly recommended Great choice for a versatile big muff,positive
You have to pay a lot more at a guitar store for something like this Granted it doesnt look as nice but it does its job I put couple of them up and have my guitar hanging on it without any problem great product for the price,positive
Its always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place Promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer about three inches would be great But otherwise a wise and good purchase Desktop Stand,positive
The price is greatThe sound is goodThe power jack however leaves a little to be desiredMy standard Boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal 10x easier than any other pedalIve now secured it with tape so it should be okBased on other reviews my guess is that I just got a dud and that most of them are okay Seems like a good pedal but mine was kind of a dud,neutral
This is the best string cleaner I have owned to date and I have owned about all of the rest The way it is packaged makes it super easy to pop the lid and apply it The casing is tough enough to be thrown into my gig bag and carried all over without the lid coming off or the case breaking The other string cleaner that is a bottle with cloth applicator spills out and the cloth wears out too fast then leaves cloth pieces on the strings This product does not waste the cleaning agent it applies evenly and there is NO cloth residue left on the strings to pick off The cleaning agency works so well it looks like I have cleaned a BBQ grill when I wipe my strings down Amazing how dirty the strings get after just a few hours of play this product will get that gunk off I am done looking for a better string cleaner because this product has the best cleaner in the best packaging for travel Well done Fender Best String Cleaner,positive
I have the older version of this as well this newer one The older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins Sometimes this new one just wont 34hear34 the string being tuned unless its encouraged That wasnt the case with the first model Its not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate The buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it You could find the tuning being done several semitones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons The older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices And these wont clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock But if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use Yes its cool but,positive
This pedal works great and doesnt slide at all The adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion I need Not the best pedal out there by far but great for a beginner with a limited budget Good for the price,positive
These work fine no cracking they come in a nice assortment of colors and theyre easy to see when they get dropped Nice assortment of picks,positive
I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner picks tuning forks capo etc andthe price was very good best I could find for this time of hard case The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case If you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well I do not know if it will fit other guitars I have heard that some are too long for it butfor the Fender stat it works just great works great for my strat,positive
Five stars because it works on my Digitech GNX guitar processor which requires 9 volts and about 75 Milliamps This has an output of 300 Milliamps For electronics the voltage has to be correct But an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs So this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the 300 Mamps Just be sure your 9v device doesnt require more than the 300 Ma this can deliver But its a power adapter I cannot be in love with a power adapter I wouldnt call it love,positive
I had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing methodGood picks though Love to thickness but too small,neutral
Im giving this one 5 stars with the caveat that you MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break The thermoplastic ones broke on me within 23 months of use 3 different ones until I got the silver one which has not had that problem Every music store I go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones and they look in disbelief at me when I say they break But they did if I leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces and could poke someones eye out in a public performance freaky Theres something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure andor temperature fluctuation that does itI live in northern california so I dont know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problemThe SILVER ALUMINUM ONE by contrast hasnt broken in now nearly a year of use and shows no hints of doing that It feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic no hint of plastic but it is very light and not heavy like the G7 ones are I made sure to order the silver aluminum one through Amazon since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic and I only want to make sure I get the aluminum oneThe silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really is the best capo Ive ever had super easy to use very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while youre going from playing one song to another you dont have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it which is a spectacular design it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos and its out of the way of your hands doesnt interfere when you play any chord The screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesnt hurt the fingers when turning it Its the least obtrusive and best capo ever Ill also add that I have an old carpal injury so I want the least strain and small hands so I want the least awkward and most light capo and this does that I absolutely love it and Im glad that the aluminum ones are durable Excellent best design ever but only get the SILVER aluminum one not the thermoplastic as they break Ive had 3 break on me,positive
This is a very secure and almost comfortable There should be a pick pocket on both ends but it is a nice feature Nice strap,positive
I bought this and a Hohner Special 20 key of C harp to test them both out This harp is a great harp pretty much the exact same as the Hohner Special 20 in overall quality Feels a little more airtight brighter and louder than the hohner but in sidebyside testing the effect is diminishedThe Hohner Special 20 just seems to have this little extraexpression to it More life or somethingBoth harps very bendable etc Real high qualityAs for the replaceable reed platesAmazon has this harp marked down to about the 25 level Reed plate replacements are about 19 Now I realize that at retail thats half the price of a RETAIL harp but only 6 less than a whole new harp otherwiseWith this in mind I would generally recommend beginners start with the Hohner Special 20 Just a slightly better or at least more funsounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available free in my opinion Excellent but not quite a Hohner,positive
My husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar His old one lasted about 10 years Worth the cost Good quality,positive
The only flaw is the rubber gaskets in the joints These deteriorate over 3 or 4 years I go through these quite a bot but for 2030 you cant go wrong Tubes are tough and sturdy great bang for your buck,positive
Strong and wont tipprice is very affordableI own several and have had no trouble with themBuy it and you will see great stand,positive
My experience with these straps has been great The polyester material is sturdy and comfortable the leather post binding is sturdy and easy to use The straps have PETABS buckles and are easily adjusted Ive not experienced any issues with the buckles breakingNote It is possible that this material can become brittle if stored in high heat a car trunk or in sunlight within a hot car but that problem isnt a manufacturing defect so much as a material deficitFor the price the functionality is excellent If you are looking for a product for an everyday use guitar with little investment or maintenance this is it Inexpensive and comfortable,positive
I love this little tuner Its better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar and as accurate and easier to use than the one on my VOX Tonelab STIm planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case Works as advertised,positive
I own several of the Snark tuners The SN1 settles quickly and works with a wide array of instruments Tuning couldnt be simpler Just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and in an instant there it is The display is bright and easy to read and the graph has a lot of resolution The SN1 senses frequency through vibration It is transposable and it offers a metronome feature The SN1 is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful 34electric blue34 color Snark SN1 Tuner,positive
I have been playing guitar offon for about 30 years I have always used whatever cheap picks I could find laying around or snagged from music shops the free ones they give you when you try out a guitar in the shop Always Medium gauge for both acoustic and electric I decided to try these Dava 1303s because they were cheap and looked cool wasnt expecting much I mean a pick is a pick right Wrong These little guys have a fantastic feel to them they seem to get in between the strings so effortlessly for flat picking Its crazy but that is what I am experiencing They are maybe a bit on the thin side but not overly so I got used to them quick Plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking Tonewise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which I rather like I recorded some with them today and it was perhaps a bit on the loud side with regards to the audible pick attack on the strings on the acoustic a Breedlove C25 But not bad and I was using a sensitive Rode condenser Havent played much with them on my electric yet customized Fender Stratocaster but Im sure they will be fine there as well I like these picks a LOT and am ordering a dozen more to keep around Good stuff best pick I have ever used,positive
At the 600 price point for an all tube amp PLUS reverb and tremelo well there are two pedals I wont have to buy this is insane It is not only REALLY loud but you can do anything from jangly pop to Pink Floyd to hard rock high gain modern metal heads though might want to look at ENGL I dialed in a Richie Blackmore tone the other day and just started blasting awayIts also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained useThe only thing that was a drag about it was that the footswitch which controls the reverb and tremolo is sold separately at about 40 street and everybody was out I managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck They should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks Unbelievable Value for Money,positive
I enjoy playing this thing so much Its reasonably quiet acoustically but it shines when plugged in Plus is looks good the actual color and finish are quite rich and shiny respectivelyIt stays in tune after string breakin and the intonation is ok not spot on but definitely good enough The tuners are basic but they work well It is thinner than a normal uke about half the body depth I find holding it without a strap to be harder than a normal sized uke but with a strap its very comfortableMine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket The bag itself is also pretty basic but good enough for what it is a bag to hold your uke and some misc items Fun little uke Solidly built but with small flaws,positive
I am really liking the size of this board I have a Line6 G50 wireless Korg Pitchblack Xotic EP booster and Xotic SP compressor and they all fit very nicely The board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles The case is also really well made good zippers and stitching Id buy this again in a heartbeat Great pedal board great case,positive
My 1st Wah This is going to take some getting used to regarding the switches knobs and buttons I am working on getting that nice way sound which Ive come across somewhat It sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords One thing I would have like would be to have some more detailed instructions about all of the functions it offers Behringer has never been very documentation oriented Nice Wah,positive
I disliked having to wait a month to receive what I couldve gotten at my local music store The capo does what its does These capo I know will lose their tension in time I thought I had chosen a different capo Thats what happens when I stay at the computer too long without my glasses Okay Capo,neutral
Ive tried other strings with the Jackson with no luck what a stupid guitar to string anyway I like the sound they do seem to carry better if only a little The texture seems to be a bit rougher but Im sure they will be fine to play once broken in Pulse there Rocksmith endorsed LOL Jackson Rose,positive
Im a huge fan of Elixirs This however is my first go with the polyweb but there is no disappointment here GREAT,positive
I have KK pickups in other guitars This is the first one Ive bought that had the smaller transducers It needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued Pure Western with the larger transducers Like other KK pickups it sounds darned good With a decent PA head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking The pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack This one comes with an ingenious DIY installation jig made from Im not kidding cardboard golf tees and double sided tape It makes placement a snap The best pickup is still an external mic but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer You can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations They sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup KK pickups are the best value in transducers,positive
This is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great So far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great Nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough If problems arise later with this cable I will update this review but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable Hosa Electric Guitar Cable GTR210,positive
I play 12 nights a week in a midiassisted duo Our PA is a pair of Mackie 15 Thumps powered on the floor and Behringer 12 B212D powered on stands with a Mackie board We adjust the PA to the room by adding or reducing the number of powered speakers In larger rooms we have a regular pair of floor monitors but in smaller rooms where you are stuck in a corner between the coat rack and the waiters station you know the spot where they generously removed two small tables we dont have space for floor monitors These smaller jobs have become much more common and I needed a compact yet powerful monitor Since we work with midi sound modules to reproduce the drums bass and assorted extra instuments it is very important that we hear these sounds clearly The Behringer monitors do the job well The overall sound is clean and clear the speakers are light and portable and for me the boom stand adapter works well I compared the Behringers to their clone the Mackie SRM 150 and frankly I couldnt hear a major difference with my MP3 player playing through them Obviously Behringer cloned the Mackies and did a good job They have all of the same inputs and outputs as the Mackies and look almost exactly the same I have owned a pair of Behringer B21D powered speakers for about three years now and they have been knocked over and mistreated accidentally and still work great every night so I am a fan of Behringer gear In the end the real difference was the price The Behringers go for 15000 while the Mackies go for about 25000 The choice was simple since I couldnt hear or see a major difference I bought the Behringers I have only had them for about two months but I have been pleased so farUpdate It has been a couple of months more since I started using these monitors and have even purchased an additional one I still love the sound and all of the other things I posted above but forget about the boom stand adapter It is very difficult to get lined up so the mic is facing you and because of the angle of the monitor itself which is not adjustable the boom will not stay in place I am using a good quality telescoping mini boom that is not very big or heavy at all but it will not stay up Save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand Other than that these are great monitors Great little monitor Better than expected,positive
For me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be usedIts not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down In many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers So a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involvedAs far as the SN8 is concernedWRONGIve found the SN8 to in fact be Super Tight BUT one has to insure that there isnt even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green barThis is what I dont like about the other type of Snark display Its not symmetric It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit If the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat When Im on pitch I want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanishIn that regard the image shown here is wrong It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow UhmnoThe SN8 is Super Tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semitones if thats what floats your boat and as they say on TV All for an incredibly low priceI keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case At this price I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way No better clipon tunerperiod,positive
These do really well I only wish Id ordered the lights I usually buy the Elizir but I thought Id give these a try Im sorry Martin but I like the Elixers the best Just my opinion guitar strings,positive
Finally a product that is as simple to use as a pointandshoot camera Literally I opened the box put in two batteries the memory card read the quickstart guide put the Zoom on the included stand and got out my mandolin and started recording The sound quality is great and you can play it back directly on the Zoom by plugging in some headbuds included The control buttons operate like a DVD remote with a menu button using the fastforward and reverse to scroll through entries and the record button as the setFor someone who is not wellversed in audio terminology gain sampling rates mics prepost amps levels whatever I just set it to medium gain watched to make sure the lines dont go too far up and was recording away in two steps Push record to test the gain level and push record again red light stays on to record and push record to stop The file is saved and then you can push playpause to listen back Deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a VCR you can use this puppyIt is also handy portable and easy to take places I will take it to record jam sessions music lessons and practice to evaluate my playing and instrument comparisons The sound quality is great and I could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is I wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise finger slide noise and other assorted twangs and twings It records both in WAV huge files and mp3 compressed with various quality levels to choose from You can easily connect it to a computer WindowsMac with the included USB cableThe only thing missing is a remote Since you have to push the button on the recorder you have to move to it to activatedeactivate it Also picks up noise from your movements But for the price 199 its a real gemI always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise doesnt cost a lot and delights the customer On this one it is the included wind sock a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording Cool PointandRecord Simplicity,positive
Bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer The clip is a bit larger than I expected but it just fits on to the bridges under the strings If I had paid more attention to the picture on the site I would have known how large the clip is in relation to the 14 plugIt does its job picking up vibrations from the instrument rather than noise from the room Works well while other things are going on around you It seems to track truer with this clip than with the internal microphone meaning it doesnt bob up and down as much If that holds true for other instruments I may start using this clip on everythingI saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled Korg The one I got is labeled both on the package and on the clip Works well,positive
I bought this for my acoustic Bought another one for my electric Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6 Holds my bass guitars easily as well Nice hanger,positive
If you cant find a container and add your own sponge then buy thisKeeping a valuable guitar humidified is essentialI think this item should cost three bucks at most and 150 would still yield a healthy profitI made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are betterI use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughtsIf you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood Better than nothing,neutral
I own two Hercules GS302B stands for my electric guitars and I couldnt be happier with them When I needed an acoustic stand I turned to the Hercules GS301B and have no regrets At the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars Not only do stands have to hold guitars securely they shouldnt harm the finishes of the instrument Unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higherend guitars since I have two guitars of this nature protecting them was of the utmost import to me Fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes and I have never had problems with mine The stands themselves both varieties fold up to be very compact if you need portability and support the guitar very securely I dont gig with these guitars so portability was not paramount to me but stability was these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy mine reside on a carpeted floor and I have never had any issues with them tipping over Some people may not love the yellow and black bumble bee coloration but I actually find it whimsically industrial I am completely happy with all three of my Hercules stands they are safe portable rugged and wont hurt the finish on most guitars If I need another guitar stand its a good bet I will buy another Hercules Great Portable Acoustic Guitar Stand Thats Safe For Most Finishes,positive
This is a really amazing portable Midi Keyboard This is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling Ive had no problems with it and the beat pads are really firm but nice You have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well It is perfect PLUS There are soo many settings and options to play with as well as setting the knobs on the keyboard to do whatever you need it to do Works amazing in FL Studio Awesome Midi Keyboard,positive
Good deal on this package of patch cords They work just as well as the more expensive ones I have used I like the length too It is long enough to make a loop in which make everything easier to work with Patch cords,positive
These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play They look cool,negative
Mine came flattened in a little box I wasnt happy that its form was deformed Well in a few days it popped back into shape so I didnt have to ship it back A good signI am using it for both some music and computer stuff The bag is well made considering its price You cannot even get a backpack for this price I love its depth A number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded This is a solid 4 depth and cozy padding around it for protection Be sure to check out all the dimensions though Its very long I was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it I think I saw micro and thought shorterNot only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack Im thinking of getting another because of thisThe only minus is that I wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder paper slot But these are just wish list items Finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited Lucky this is a good option Nice sized deep,positive
good quality for my casual use I wouldnt use it on stage because of stability or weight related issues its too light sturdy enough for me,positive
This is a very well built stand even with its slim design which also comes with a nice carrying case Very good for light portable set ups Also holds a big mic if you position the legs right completely open with the mic parallel to a leg That said do it wrong and plunk Will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only Paid 799 for it Would give it 5 stars but I know user error will cause a less careful person to crash some mics Good for kick drum and cab mics by the way anchor it down with a sand bag if using it for this purpose A Great Value,positive
The reason I stopped using amp stands was because I couldnt find anything collapsible and nonbulky It works very well and is very sturdy I use it for a Hot Rod DeLuxe Very nice NONbulky amp stand,positive
These cables are VERY good The metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins There is no play when I plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect Theres also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how I lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice Excellent quality good usability,positive
highly recommend to everyone this is a good quality cable and never have any issues whatsoever highly recommend to everyone Nice,positive
Crikey where to begin Firstly I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet Secondly they mismarked one of the packets so it appeared I had two 34D34 strings instead of two 34E34 strings Lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible They were tinny and clangy sounding Ive never heard worse strings Fortunately I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med light as well I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Balls and they were far far better Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product Ill never buy their strings again Horrible Awful Nasty Spiteful Strings,negative
I agree with other reviews that Boss exploits its customers by insisting the 300 pedal have the PSA supply but sells it separately Its a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it I used a OneSpot power supply I had already and it works fine Just glad I didnt have to shell out 20 more to Boss for something they should have provided with the ME70The first thing I noticed is that the tuner is not too good You get a letter with an arrow on each side and its not very responsiveThe Korgstyle dialin reverb controls are easy but extremely limited Expected better You get either room or hall Neither are that realisticGoing from manual patchlevel to banklevel is awkward It may just take practiceNext thing I noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected If I set the E level delayed signal level or balance at around thirty it can be clearly heard When overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected but the delayed signal remains at the original volume effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudibleDid Boss just start making multieffects pedals Have they learned nothingDespite somewhat mediocre performance and design the ME70 does have features that recommend it Some of the drives are usable The controls are accessible and easy to adjust The Solo setting on the CompFX module is a nice booster although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the ODDS module maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boostThe next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches I was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting but all it does is turn the preamp on and off or step one way through the presents FS5UIt almost appears that Boss very cynically crippled the ME70 so it did not threaten GT10 salesIm looking forward to learning more about this pedal So far it does some good things but it could be much betterHas anyone else noticed the ME70 reviews out there arent too useful Im thinking of checking out the Vox Tonelab EX which is being blown out now 225 at GC for example31612 update Despite the limitations above I like the portability of this unit It runs on 6 AAs I think which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play for example at a jam where you dont have power nearbyNew Fail update the Tremolo in this unit just stinks I mean stinks Whatever the waveform is its not a sine wave not smooth at all Very poor musical characterists Whatever engineer was in charge of this you screwed up big time Your own Boss tremolo pedals are much better than what youve put in the ME70 Why would you do that Boss I like tremolo but its virtually useless in this unit Some people wont notice but if you like that swampy Fender style tremolo you will be very disappointed Purchased today,neutral
This Planet Waves TriAction Capo is easy to use and features a micrometer adjustment knob to custom fit the capo to your specific guitar neck a feature Ive never seen on a capo before It worked excellently on several guitars I tried it on all with lightextra light guage strings with no fret buzz or noticeable detuning after removal The pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature tooI recommend this capo without reservation Great Capo,positive
I bought one of these at a music store like 2 years ago for 30 bucks I was Impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin Later I saw them for 8 here on amazon and I bought 1 for myself 1 for a sister and another for my brother in law These are a great deal I can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud It just uses vibration of the instrument the perfect tuner,positive
Fantastic sound just trust what everyone on here is saying if you buy these strings and slap em on a cheap ukulele you will have bought yourself hundreds of hours of playing and fun Excellent strings just buy em,positive
Great strap durable and good lookin It Works great for me i like this type of straps simple durable Try one Ernie Ball Strap,positive
This power supply works awesome with pedals and mini amps without giving you that static hiss you get from some other brands Doea what its supposed to,positive
Take some time but it was well worth it Ive always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards This worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before Guitars never look so good,positive
Its made by monster cable Need I say more Of course its a great cable and being able to change the rubber band on the ends is nice to identify which cable is which Buy it,positive
a little small for my hands but the kids that take lessons from me loved them Cute idea Would like different holiday designs like this okay,neutral
It does what is supposed to its a gate and clamps the noise as good as I expected at the begining I had problems with power some how it didnt power correctly but I was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain so I solved it isolating the MXR connecting it with another power supply and it work so I left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine also check config and the routing of the signal this might influence on how it works I have it right after my Wha and before my compressor and it works just fine Nice Gate,positive
This is the one you want Its a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny An investment in your musical future Timeless classic,positive
This works amazing It is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin It also works great for a guitar It works really nice with steel strings but I have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings Amazing,positive
I feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing It works great thank you Nady and Amazon Its compact and great to use ffsalsayahoocom,positive
I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playingI started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat They sounded great I use these for my telecaster in 10 46 factory spec and they are real nice tooI do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did Fender Strings are great strings,positive
Everything you need to keep your guitar clean and Polished and sexy no matter if you are a horrible player like me you will get all the chicks because your guitar looks sexy the girls will love you and the boys too Dunlop Delivers,positive
great picks they are shorter for speed and maneuvering sweeps better not to stumble in strings when sweep so for me it works fine i do use Th turtle purple big ext HH as well but i like to try this for experiment to see how it helps spleen on sweeps etc nice picks well made ,positive
i play metal hard rock and have used many different strings these give the best tone and depth you need to play hard music best strings for metal,positive
I love this pop filter It is every to attactch and doesnt scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do The adjustable arm is very flexible yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement Awesome,positive
This Behringer box is a very good tool effect I would recommend to anyone from beginner to pro One thing should be noted the light is amber not blue and no 9 volt battery is required The device comes with a removable power cord which to me is a big plus Behringer VM1 Vintage Time Machine Excellent Product,positive
This is certainly a heavy duty stand It weighs quite a bit is made of solid metal and I would not hesitate to think it could hold quite a bit of weight However while it seems stable sidetoside the spread of the legs does not taper much at all from top to bottom and I believe it would fall over quickly if bumped from the front or back This makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices Instability and Heavy,neutral
while the product is everything it said it would be I was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin it does whats is supposed to so I cant fault it in that way it just was not what I was hoping for whats more metal than metal to your strings,neutral
It does a fair job but I have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on It seems to pick up sympathetic string notes I actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate Snark SN8,neutral
This little simple looper sure is a ton of fun Beware that there is a learning curve to looping With trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while Im a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback could be better I use this mainly with a double neck bassguitar Compliments well Tons of Fun Great with a double neck,positive
I am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases This is a great pick I am using the other 5 and they play very well Really Fun Guitar Picks,positive
Let me first start off with the sizing When they say Fits Soundholes from 3375 35 they really mean itYou are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 116 smaller than the specificationsI know I did My friends Oscar Schmidt 34 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well The edges did not catch completely and it looks terribleMy classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole it did not fit at all You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboardThe main issue is the soundYes it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming slightly but enough to tellHowever it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunesFingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notesFor me that does not justify itA simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost lessAnother thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return they resell as brand new if it looks brand newThe packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened Does it matter In practical terms no not for this sort of itemI guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies I doubt it really helps,negative
got the mics from dealer fast i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones recieved the mics 3 days after i orderd them and the mics are great,positive
In general its OK but when you look at the fine writing on the fingerboard formula it says not to use on Maple which means I cant use it on either of my Gibsons Probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately Not necessary,neutral
Id rather use a solocombo pedal to save space but I find myself shopping separate pedals to satisfy my taste Looking for a little 60s for my ampthis was it,positive
Hosa cable quality can be all over the place some of their products are good sound good reliable long lasting and some of their products are not good affect sound negatively break prematurely short useful life spanThese guitar cords are actually quite nice they feel good gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami they sound good and so far they are working reliably the rubber jacket is about 2534 in diameter by eye and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plugI bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up These cables arrived in good working condition and weve been using them continuously sinceWe have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyoneI would buy more if I needed them So Far So Good,positive
Firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip Once you try these picks you never go back Best pick out there,positive
I really like this cord it rolls easy its long and its got a great powdery feel to the material I suggest having multiple of these so length wont be a problem got 6 ofem myself all sound great Right angle or StraightGreat buy cant go wrong here Rockin the 20 footer,positive
I enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks as it was interesting to try different models Dunlop picks are great dunlop picks are great,positive
I use it every day at work I use it in my guitar classes Easy to use and perfect size Really good,positive
Be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy Other than thatan excellent value Very well built,positive
I love these strings Ive tried others but I always come back to these great for beginners the phosphor Bronze provide a lowerdeeper tone that I prefer but still very bright Excellent choice for Acoustic Guitars custom light 1050,positive
Not a drop in replacment for many Fenders I installed these on a Fender Marauder and needed to drill holes in the head stock You cant see it really well in the picture but there is a metal plug on the bottom next to the screw hole that needs a hole to fit intoI sweat some bullets and used the smallest drill bit I own and stuck a piece of tape 1mm from the tip so I wouldnt drill too deep It is important to make the hole STRAIGHT in line from the screw hole so they dont go on crooked I also had to drill the screw holes about 2mm deeper because the screws that come with this go deeper into the headstockNow that theyre installed I can attest that the guitar holds its tune better and its easier to tune Before it would not respond for many pegs until twisted too far then it would suddenly break lose and be too sharpflat That happens far less now May require drilling to fit on some FenderSquire models,positive
My frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets I recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright Incredible They really clean the frets,positive

Ive been using the snark for a year or so now and I always have the suspicion that its just telling me what I want to hear that my guitar is in tune when in fact its not The other day I had to go from standard tuning to DADGAD and had about 1 minute to do so plenty of time but after the tuner said it was in tune it was time to start playing and it was well noticeably out of tune After checking each string multiple times Very frustrating I guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy If you want something that usually puts you in the ballpark but may betray you when it really counts then go with the Snark Its better than other clipons Ive used but still not cutting it in my opinion I play a Taylor 414ce A plus side is that you can buy a fivepack of batteries on amazon for 2 bucks shipping and all You will need them sooner than you think Have been burned,neutral
Solidly built works just as a mic stand shouldcouldnt be happierAs long as I take care of this Ill never need to buy a new one again Perfect Stand,positive

This is a nice leather mandolin strap Fits fine on my cheap Rogue A type mandolin Amazingly it is made in Canada not China The leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps Nice Strap,positive
This is a nice small amp It delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me One thing I like about this amp is that it is very simple not a bunch of complicated settings to worry about Another thing I think its the nicest looking amp I have and I have about 10 amps now Its about the same size as my little Fender Frontman 15 and sits sidebyside with it in my living room I use the Fender for electric and the Behringer for the acoustic for practicingIf youre looking for a no frills amp that doesnt cost a lot or take up much room this is a good one for youMakes a great little practice amp I am totally happy with this one and see no need to add an additional acoustic ampMine looks a lot different than the photo its more brown and actually looks better Nice amp for my acoustic,positive
not as much padding as I would like my old bag had more other than that I like the pockets and overall design nice bag not so padded,neutral
I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick Worked but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one Between the two of them between the 2nd3rd and 4th5th strings up next to the nut works pretty good holding these types of picks which admittedly the Wedgie was not actually designed for Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass the bass version Only down side I see is they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar havent tried it yet But otherwise worth the price and a good doodad to have around Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself real help to me staying organized great for my lap steel guitar,positive
These tuners look and feel great I used them on a Warmouth neck that I purchased for my strat build It was kind of a pain having to drill the 2 holes for the prongs on each tuner but that is the way it is designed They would be a suitable replacement for Fender tuners should one ever breakThe gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar Quality tuners,positive
These are thin They allow getting your pedals very close to each other and let you optimize your pedal board space I had other cables on my pedal boards I replaced everything with those Gets your pedal board organized,positive
First I love these picks and used them exclusively for years I have dozens of them they never wear out I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band and never had any issues They are very comfortable and easy to controlNow the bad the sound Not the sound of the plucked not itself but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable plinking sound that is audible through your amp If all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to meSo too bad I think these are great picks but Id like them to be made of a softer material Good Bad,neutral
I take a medication that makes my hands shake therefore I have a difficult time with fine muscle movements I switched from Dunlop Jazz IIIs which I loved to these puppies because they have a great feel to them and you dont have to worry about dropping them They are also bigger than the Jazz IIIs making it a bit easier to hold on to made for shaky hands,positive
I bought this for my MAudio keyboard but it also works equally well with my Casio Lighted KeyboardJust be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connectionThis is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano Works as advertised,positive
behringer perfect pedalboardI can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb1000 from costa rica I recommend itthanks behringer behringer perfect pedalboard,positive
These DAddario strings are great I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life Intonation is good and Ive noticed less breakage as wellThese strings are a bit bright but have plenty of good sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat even more so than my Sheraton Being from the old school I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper but what can ya do Besides that I am totally stoked and happy with these I think I might try 9s on the Sheraton but even as is they play and sound very good Like em better than my old Bullets,positive
A good cable for the money Could have better stress release but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value good cable for the money,positive
Nice little kit it has 800 grit sandpaper in it I hadnt noticed that in the listing maybe I overlooked it I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade The 600 made it glassy smooth again wet sanding I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for meI had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible I was miserable my guitar sounded like sAfter 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bobs your uncle good as new Im going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitarsNice little kit I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days Works a charm on acoustic guitars havent tried it on the electric guitars yet smooth operator makes fingers dance,positive
 No power No Sound But It Sounds GREAT,positive
Versus the Godlyke Id say this is the better purchase Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power 2amps this is slighlty less at 17mA 1700mA or 17amps Anyway if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board you may want to reconsider what you are using The product itself is plastic but seems solid I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem Being plastic though you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over etc I do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the Godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into 1 spot as advertised The heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival The extender that comes with is good seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get I only wish it came with two of them I am using a Pedaltrain Pro board and at 329 inches it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals The combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 18 power connections some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power One thing I have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply A lot of companies think that if their voltage is close to 9 volts thats good enough The reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product You will find some higher end devices specifically warn NOT to use anything higher than 9 volts so 96 volts isnt close enough Anyway while I have not checked the output of the adapter yet I did fire it up on all the pedals I could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet It is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other noise from your signal chain Id buy this again and in fact I may buy another just as a back up It is a tad pricey at thirty bucks feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but all in all a good buy over the competition Good buy,positive
I dont play with a guitar below my waist I am six feet tall While very well made wide comfortable and good looking this sling was far too short and had to be returned Nicely made but way too short,neutral
I was looking for a sustainer pedal for my maudio keyboard to use with garageband and found this so I bought it and it works great does exactly what it says it does and Actually looks cool Its an amazing tool for keyboard player Highly Recommended Cool Pedal,positive
I love these carry bags They allow me to easily carry multiple guitar stands music stands etc all at once Who couldnt use an extra arm or two when moving equipment Well made and a fair price too Makes carrying easy,positive
I was happy it was made in the USA but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs Might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasnt done by shipping Made in the USA,neutral
Im glad I tried these I wont order them again I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks not really thoughEdit Im nothing if not fair My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335 I stand by that review However now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the GodinI will buy these again I changing my review from Just Okay to Contextually Perfect Ok Ill add a star your right I should add a star There Contextually Perfect,positive
I LOVE THIS AMP Here are the reasons Solidly made everything is high quality Best of all it comes with Fender Fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your PC using the USB cable included and 34control34 all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the ampwithout even touching the knobs INCLUDING special effects like various stomp box addins effects like reverb distortion phaser factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the PC screen visually You can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created If you want to play a Pink Floyd song you can download a David Gilmour preset and there you go You got your Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall preset ready to go This is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me I can record directly from the amp into my PC Mixpad software program What a Deal for only 100I Bought Two of them,positive
DAddario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinkys But Found That These Last Longer The Ernies Bend and Play Well But They Tend To Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernies Start Corroding Within A Week These DAddario Strings Stay Brighter Longer I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks The Ernies Only Last Me A Week 2 Weeks At The Most That Can Get Expensive Fast All Around The DAddario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me Retraction when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings but they are no longer my preference A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these DAddarios DRs last three times as long as DAddario the DRs cost a lil more but they are way better for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings Best Strings Available Until I Played DR Strings,neutral
i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now its time to treat myself with this gift so i dont have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china its very rare thing to see now a days Great gift for any player,positive
my guitar strap was old I replaced it with this one as I didnt want to head into town is black and no frills like it,positive
Luv it I had version 1 and this amp isnt much differentthey both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software Another Fender added to my collection,positive
I am finally feedback free I use this on my 310 Taylor with a KK Pure pickup systemI play mostly in a church worship team and am usually right in front of a monitorThis blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundholeI dont get a huge loss of tone but a little bitI will take that over having to worry about moving around and getting feedback like crazyHighly recommend Buzz Free,positive
I needed a cheap mic stand that didnt break the bank This little guy fit the bill I dont know if it could stand up next to the Hercules stands that I have used for years in terms of longterm durability but for a simple homeuse stand it is perfect It is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced Great entrylevel stand Perfect for the Price,positive
Ive been using MXR Micro Chorus for over 30 years They just dont get any better than MXR Might be a little old fashioned but You get what you pay for And the sound Wellllllllllll just give it a try Youll love it Best Doc One of the Best,positive
Good design easy to hang on to these picks Reasonable price makes it even better I dont often use picks but when I do I use these I will buy more in the future great picks,positive
DAddario strings are awesome These strings speak with a bolddefined and POWERFUL voice The bass strings boom with thunderous lows and the treble strings glisten with sparkling highs without being too harsh They are very sweet to the ears and tonally balanced across the board without one frequency overpowering the other I have tried a lot of different strings DRs Ernie Ball Dean Markley Elixir GHS you name it After putting a set of EXL110s 1046 gauge on my Gibson SG special faded and comparing them to Ernie Ball I noticed a huge difference not only were they brighter but they lasted longer I used to change a set of Regular Slinkys every two months but with EXLs I was changing strings every five to six months They work in a variety of applications metal hard rock jazz blues reggae etc and respond great at any dynamic level DAddario is The Players Choice for a reason after using these I cant see myself using anything else They feel goodsound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set If you havent used them yet give em a try and see what youre missing DAddario is the way to go,positive
I like this almost as well as the Ernie Ball alternative Ive been using for 20 years with Shaler strap locksThese work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently You may or may not love the details but they work just fine and to me are extremely comfortable Very good very price effective,positive
Very good and very useful device Very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do very very well Four out of Five Stars,positive
Im another reviewer who has upon personal inspection discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar I returned itIve 34First Act34 brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed Dangerous for loved guitars,negative
This is a good guitar for the price Played well right out of the box The finish is beautiful and I found no defects Sounds good and well worth the money Good One,positive
Sounds and feels nice I have an entry level guitar a Peavey Rockmaster It came with entry level strings These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrumentBe advised the low E string is thick When I try to depress the 12th fret I cant get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger Well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game Worthwhile upgrade,positive
It does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well I might add Much better than a standard clip on a mic This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off since its rubber If it does break has a lifetime warranty Had a Shure SM58 on a table on a stand in this clip pounded on the table only picked up the tap sound my hand has making and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table Moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise Cant ask for more than that Does a nice job,positive
First I have to say the only reason I bought this is that we have two pot belly pigs that live in our houseso this was a nobrainer to purchase just to have as a fan of pigs and I play the guitar tooNow for the reviewThis little 34collector34 amp turns out to be something I will actually use rather than put on a shelf to look at with all of our other pig stuffI was very surprised how well built it is Its solid as a rock with chrome handles edge guards and a pig snout for the volume controlIt looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review the AC adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally It also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer Now I can take the Fender or Gibson electrics rather than the acousticOkay I keep getting off topic hereThe sound is clear and crisp for its size Sure its not my Fender Mustang IV but I didnt pay 600 bucks for it either But then my Fender doesnt have a pigs snout There are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob But most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway I would compare the sound coming from it as above average but its the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction for me anywayAs for its size I would say its just about the size of your average small jewelry box But its much heavier deceptively heavy but I like that It doesnt have that 34cheap34 feel about itLike I said I WILL use this occasionally especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van I look forward to the comments the amp will get Im sure way more than my guitar playing skills as I still have a lot to learn But learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more funIn summary I would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone whos looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an AC adapterA word to best describe it34COOL34 WAY better louder and clearer than I ever expected AND IT IS SO CUTE,positive
If youre worried that the 30 mm is too big for your guitar youre probably rightIf you dont use a pick for your bass then you dont want this eitherBut if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you Thick easy release hard to drop,positive
Ive used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel sound and overall quality If you play Fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were DAddario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well Been buying them ever since and love them Fender Strings,positive
I liked the fact i can insert more than 5 picks and they really stand tight and dont fall down But the original glue was not string enought and the holder has fallen on the ground Yes it works,positive
Excellent strap for the money The leather is thick and supple In fact the materials are so thick that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setupA note about length Some might find the standard Levys strap length too short so be aware what you need and note there are XL versions of these For me many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me including those from Franklin Dunlop BMF wide and Mono even the short model was about an inch too long Im a bass player and when standing I prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height A few basses I prefer higher Id suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable measure button hole to button hole and be sure youre ordering the right length Excellent quality construction and materials very comfortable length just right,positive
The strap is very reliable the pick pocket is a nice touch but if playing for extended periods of times you might want to go with something more comfortable Sturdy Strap,positive
it is ok as long as you dont bump your guitar else boom it hits the floor I dont trust it and amazon has it way over priced It will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place its too light,negative
On the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neatThey dont sound horrible I mean they are not computer speakers or anything The sound is very forward I would say harsh Thats not uncommon among studio monitors There is definitely a lot of clarity here Not a ton of bass but thats pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size Theres a few schools of thought on studio monitors Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music others think they should sound more like a normal speaker These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this Any flaws would be quite noticeableI previously used KRK RP8s so I can compare these to them Granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors I liked them better than these They were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bassI was going to put a woofer on these and burn them insee if I could improve the situationBUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after its turned on The buzz increases in volume over time I tried moving them to a different location turning the volume down even disconnecting the audio feed so they were only plugged into the power Nothing stopped the buzz If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds So I sent them back I wasnt really impressed with the sound and Im definitely not satisfied with the quality control so Im going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead Maybe Behringer 3031as or something I think its worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a fullsized monitor One speaker buzzed both sounded just ok,negative
In my experience these cables were not great The connectors rattle they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise I cant expect miracles at that pricepoint but I certainly expected better I avoid this brand of cables Cheap connections,negative
Do you have a Hercules guitar stand Then this will make transporting it easy It seems like a gimmick but I have two stands and its nice to be able to grab both of them by using the bag straps and still be able to carry more gear with my other hand Performs as advertised,positive
I have yet to install this neck but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect There is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start Materials and labor all look good to great Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most 34econo necks34 seem to be off by at least 1834 Id rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and redrill Frets look good and nut looks good Until I can install it I can only really vouch for 45 starsLong story short is this neck looks better than many Ive had that cost 2X as much or more Unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the 5th star Even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the 5th star While some may not like the flatter radius Id argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they arent as much of an issue And it is clearcoated maybe not a nice amber finish but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all So again another reason for the 5th star unbeatable at the price,positive
Inexpensive and practical You dont have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this just about any angle will work Needs little space another plus Works good with most electric guitars,positive
I bought one of these about a year ago and I am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a backup Great tuner just clip it on the headstock turn it on and tune display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so I can even do it without my glasses on I have used it in noisy environments other instruments tuning or playing and it still works never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or Fender StratocastorThe ONLY thing that could use improvement is the autooff function mine has failed to detect an extended duration of NO audio energy and as such stayed turned on until it drained the battery After that I got in the habit of making SURE I turned it off when not in use And it uses commonly found 2032 cell batteries so not A big deal to replace just grab a twopack of them at the grocery store to keep on handOverall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars great tuner,positive
This workk well however I do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range I may need new cables Tuned Up,positive
Steady and stable with the lip to hold material without slipping off when turning pages and deep enough to set my metronome on it too Easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones Just what I need Perfect,positive
Arrive in trashed packing but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it No good,negative
This pedal is ok by which I mean I provides the basic functions it says it does Qualitywise it feels a bit cheapishI was afraid I was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it The case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from The power switch and chorusvibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find and are not that easily accessible by a toeyou gotta bend over and flip those They are smallOn the other hand it was only sixtyninebucks relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedalI dont care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks Thats not pedal board friendly in my opinion Nice as a tabletop effect The footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 775 x 65 approx The standard 9V center negative power supply is a postive excuse my punIf you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation echos vibratos reverbs old style chorusesthis is not a bad way to get started playing with that You can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bankPersonally I have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space so for menot a keeper Your situation might be different than mineNot a bad product acceptable at its price point just didnt impress me much For the price a pretty good deal But cheapish construction,neutral
If I didnt think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldnt do it plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I cant find in RadioShack Best Buys no where else I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself but for business These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way I would like to apply for a position with themRegardsffsalsa Great cables,positive
I read many negative reviews on several sites I can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician I must say that the set I just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in G A and Bb There are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments This is what gives them their charm and voice I find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and I will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do The set is quite nice for the price Quite nice for the price,positive
Installed one on my CF Martin almost leaving a thumb superglued to the inside of the guitar An interesting experience would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar Im sure that some of my DNA still resides in the guitarBought another for my brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the CF Martin through a brand new Kustom Sienna Pro30 acoustic guitar amp from Amazon Ive read that folks prefer the KK over the madefortheGSMiniTaylorpickupGet it So nice he bought it twice,positive
I bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar They work very well I dont do too much recording or gigging though so Im not sure how well they would work for those activities But as for as practicing and just messing around at home these work quite well and you cant beat the price Ive never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion I definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together Great Cables for Pedals,positive
you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger i was shocked at how good it sounds not just 34for the money34 but over all its won a spot on my pedalboard and im picky worth way more,positive
I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem but I got literally 8 plugins and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain Its like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends Soooo its pretty much useless to me I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point I wouldve shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss I think I payed like 8 for it so whatever I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end Item was NOT like it was described Be careful,negative
It does a good job for the price I have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps Works fine,positive
This is quality construction Its definitely a must Im a taller guy and its important to have proper posture for longer playing periods Im glad I bought this Nice build Should last a while,positive
Its a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from very good value at only 10 not counting shipping very satisfied A great foot rest works on carpets or Whatever,positive
If your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings These are a littl ehard to play Good but hard to play,positive
I got this for my Boss Loop Station but it doesnt work very well I keep hoping Ill find something it DOES work well with Got this for my Boss Loop Station,negative
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open which oddly had staples holding it closed Something Funky Going On,negative
I have at least 5 of these I like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport Holds acoustic or electric Good quality stable economical I have read that the foam padding can react with nitrocellulose lacquer and mar the instruments finish I havent seen that on my older stands but to error on the side of caution I have glued thin leather to the back and lower support of the stands It is working fine I bought the first about 10 years ago It is still like new Good stand,positive
but theyre the cheesiest looking leather Ive ever seen real leather for sure but somehow the maker found real leather that looks like cheap vinyl imitation leather Works great have two,positive
Very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best idea good for live performance on a budget Very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best,positive
I bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that I use with my bass The 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a nonintrusive smart looking setup Im pleased Ive owned them for a few months now No issues at all and they look good Bought a pair,positive
Good microphone for the money sounds a little better than my AKG D88S knocked it down to 4 stars due to the fact it does not have an onoff switch I am a user of Behringer products though own 2 of their amps Behringer XM8500 microphone,positive
Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my SG It worked out perfectly I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years Of course over the years Ive tried other strings but always seem to come back to Ernie Ball strings There are no surprises The quality Is always the same Also I believe the very best value for the dollar From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings You just cant go wrong I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them Heavier gauge string for playing slide,positive
This is hands down the best delay pedal I have ever used I owned a Boss DD3 for many years and I have tried various other brands but this little beauty takes the cake The delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound It is very easy on the ears in both clean and distorted settings and it adds exponentially to your tone When turned off it is true bypass which means it does not color your guitars natural tone in any way I recognized a notable difference when I unhooked my DD3 and plugged in the Carbon CopyThe pedal is slightly smaller than most pedals but it is built like a tank The price point is a little expensive but in this instance you get what you pay for If youre looking for a creamy true bypass analog pedal then look no further The Carbon Copy is the best there is Creamy precise delay,positive
Hard to believe that I need to review a Pick but I really like these picks I got a half dozen for Christmas and was thrilled I also got one of those Pick Punches Super cool item if you ever get a chance to get one it is the 351 style and a standard credit card is dang close to the Medium Fender Pick Only thing I dont like about these picks is that they seem to wander away on their own so keep an eye on them Nice Picks,positive
No manual You can print one off the internet but it should come with one given its price I purchase such so I could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live Dont believe this is what it is meant for A simple delay looper will suffice This can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs Too techy,negative
It is a basic music stand but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements You can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store great value Simple and excellently priced,positive
This microphone only records in mono and if youre unsure of what that means it doesnt capture sound to its full potential and doesnt create a leftright feeling All recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts I wouldnt recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality It looks nice and it would b e great for a Skype call but it really wasnt what I was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out If youre looking for a mono microphone this is however a very good mono microphone Its okay I have better,neutral
Ive had several PODs and have never really been impressed with their tone Right out of the box the HD 500 totally blew me away I know their marketing calls it HD because of the added tonal characteristics and its true there is a huge difference between the HD series and the older PODs I cant really say why they sound better but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older PODs without much tweaking and NO EQing although one can tweak the tone with several EQsOne complaint with the older PODs that I agree with was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone This is not the case with the HD 500 Ive been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much workAt first I purchased theLine 6 POD HD 300because I didnt see the value of the HD 500 After thinking about it I decided to pick up the HD 500 and compare the two pedals I definitely think the HD 500 is worth the extra cash even for a hobbyist such as myself There are extra controls on the looper and extra record time The wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the 500s I could be wrong but I DO remember them being different The dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the HD 500 are amazing Im sure Im forgetting some differences but I know Im happy that I went with the HD 500 over the HD 300The drivers seem to work great on both Windows 7 Pro 64bit and Mac OS 106 they have 64bit Mac drivers now The included software is OK I get the feeling they are still building it out Its a bit glitchy but seems to work OK for the most part The software updater works great and Ive already had a couple of firmware updates since I purchased the HD 500 bug fixes There is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct tube amp feel and behaviorI nearly purchased the M13 to plug into myFender Super Champ XD Electric Guitar Amplifier but I noticed the HD 500 had the same number of effects PLUS amp modelling for the same price I know the two pedals are designed for different purposes but for me the HD 500 made much more sense I can use it to practice with headphones or plug into my amp as an effects pedal To use it as an effects only pedal one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup I also decided to test playing the HD 500 directly into aBehringer Eurolive B215D Active 550Watt 2Way PA Speaker System with 15inch Woofer and 135inch Compression Driver which may replace my other amps as my primary rig I get the Behringer today so well seeThe build quality over the POD X3 Live has improved The case is now entirely metal vs a combination of metal and plastic I can definitely see this being heavy roadgig worthy I also purchased aGator GK2110 Compact Keyboard Gig Bag which fits the HD 500 albeit very snuglyOverall Im very happy with this setup and recommend this amp modelereffects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home especially with headphones on a wide variety of musical styles The best POD yet,positive
This is the best USB microphone out for under 100 bucksIts a shame that its been out for a few years now and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one I love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording The sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as I have this fairly close to my computer in my office and I cant hear the computer in my recordingsI havent used this microphone with instruments as I am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video and it sounds greatThe only thing you have to do it plug it in and go You need no additional drivers to run this microphone in Windows 7 I did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone but it worked perfectly after thatI just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shockmount YETI combo pack as I have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and havent used the base that much since arriving at that setupIf you are in the market for an excellent USB microphone look no further you cant get anything better than this for under 100 bucks Just make sure you get a pop filter for it and Yes the BLUE Pop Filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesnt Just check out my review video for the Blue PopBlue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter Love this Microphone,positive
The first thing I do when I get a new instrument is put a straplok on it before gigging with itTheyre easy to install I havent had one fail on me yetI have straploks on nine instruments right now and I just ordered another for my new bassI cant recommend them highly enough one for every guitar,positive
Buy this Its cheap and better than Fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much It can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heardAmazing sounds Awseome,positive
this capo helps make aesome music thankful for it i like using it for all kinds of palying like at the beach cool capo,positive
Got a packet to try but I found they are better than the Gator screws that came with my case My equipment is very secure Highly recommended Good rack screws at a good price,positive
Good little connector cable Well constructed durable built to last I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes Worth it Works great,positive
For years I have used a different type of capo this one is so much easier to use and does an excellent job Works great well made,positive
This strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product Well made and sturdy It would be hard to beat Excellent,positive
Started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the DVDs and books and my teach used a clipon tuner and my interest went sky high I am a professional drummer with serious guitar envyAll I can say is GOODBY JACKIN TUNERSWith this little baby it makes no difference whether you are playing an electric guitarbass or an acoustic and you can tune on the fly with the thing clipped on to your headstock all the time Admittedly you can do this with with a jackin tuner without the jackin part but the results arent always that good and you have to fish around for the tunerThe whole turn the amp down unplug from the amp jack into a tuner unplug from the tuner plug back into the amp turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicingplaying the guitar but those days are over I need to keep my enthusiasm level high and actually play the guitar instead of fishing around for a tunerAs far as accuracy it is as good or better than any jackin tuner I have I have three different brands Goodby plugjackin tuners,positive
its very easy to install and are very effective in locking the strap to the guitar holds it in place and are of high quality material i recommend it a lot strap it lock it,positive
well it is worth the money in my opinion however i had to take about a quarter inch total off the sides for it to fit the pocket not that difficult really the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished the rod had to be adjusted to get proper relief and the headstock is a little larger than a fender for the price worth the small effort it took to get it rockn frets are good but not exact fit for body,neutral
A genuine Fender part that looks great on my 10 MIM Strat Good price and it arrived quickly as well Very nice,positive
Pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this Good quality XLR cable that works 100 fine Im happy with this purchase Works great,positive
Well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions1 Pretty much what I expected much more relaxed at higher volumes than the M12 Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1 will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy This is of course via the front panel only Im sure it can be done using the Fuse editor3 Its supposed to be 7 lbs heavier than the M1 but it sure doesnt feel like it I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if theres a way to shoehorn a 12 speaker in there4 For the most part the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update needing just a few adjustments here and there5 Im appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I wont have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1 That of course translates to more headroom for the power ampMore from editing via Fuse here are a few of the things that I found and liked The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxes Cab and vice versa The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57s cab while the 57 models propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65s less sparkly cab The 57 also seems to have more low end girth The Twin is a bit too icepicky sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassmans cab The SuperSonics Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain Its good for keeping things from getting too buzzy Its a very fat sounding Cab sim Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my TexMex pickups I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet my other guitar has mini humbuckers but somehow I get the feeling that I wont like it as much as I do with the strat I think this is understandable though Since Fender has always been all about the single coils Im not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot onSo far for 200 bucks I couldnt ask for more Just as I expected,positive
Let me just start out by saying that Ive been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time I still own most of these units except for this onethe JoYo compressor My setup is a very simple onestarting with a Stratocaster to compressor wahwah superoverdrive boost pedal delay then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb vibrato I dont want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals Ive tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them This thing simply didnt work right out of the box While the outside of this stomp box is all metal the inside is full of very low grade parts from China Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board I ended up sending it back for a full refund I dont in anyway blame the seller They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them againjust nothing with the name JoYo on it If youre only buying these based on price I would say buyer bewareyou get what you pay for Is This Thing On,negative
I like the quality of the picks Not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style Thanks Good quality picks,positive
I bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio The idea was to give the vocalistinstrumentalist personal control over their own levels without the engineer having to change any settings manually The item works GREAT for that as long as youre not using a powered microphone If you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing and interference when the monitor and microphones are plugged in Plus the humbuzz is so loud you cant hear anything from the microphone The only way Ive gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a Direct Box and then into the board Im told that a Hum eliminator would do the trick but thats another 40100 I really wasnt planning on forking out Id rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalistinstrumentalist than pay an extra 100 at the moment Again its very good at what it does if you dont power the microphone Great for unpowered microphones,neutral
I love this now I dont have to find my pickI bought one and this is my second one for my another guitarI also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder Each 5005,positive
This is the last Capo you will ever need to buy unless you have the need for both curved and straight capos for various fretboards in which case youll still want to stay with the G7th capos for both needs No need to worry about damaging your guitar neck from over tightening or nonpadded contact No spring clamp to wear out lose gripping strength which produces a buzz over time Low profile design is the easiest for playability as you dont have to learn to play around it like you do on a Keyser The unique adjustable tension also allows you to control to sound to your liking great for advanced tricks like capoing just a few strings Cant say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design Love it and have one in every case The last best design in Capos,positive
This cable seems topnotch to me Some complaints I heard had to do with this brand not lasting Of course those guys abuse their equipment Maybe that will be something Ill encounter but this cable appears to be very well madeand it works great I take very good care of my gear so I expect this one to last Only gave it four out of five because Id rate some other cables slightly higher This a great cable the length is perfect for practice and Id buy another Works for Me,positive
First it tunes very accurately Second its low profile I keep it tucked under the head stock the crowd cant really see and I it is completely usable if I need to quickly tune during the set and my ears arent cutting it Third buy it if you are looking for a new tuner Fantastic Tuner,positive
Monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable 21 Feet Angled to Straight 14Inch plugto use with my keyboards but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought Id pinch a few pennies I am so glad I didI compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and aside from looks could not detect any difference in sound I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards ensuring that each model was used on each instrument still no differenceWhat the more expensive model has going for it is looks I am not sure it the higher priced model is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier siblingBottom line carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp if possible before making a purchase decision You may find as I did that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value even from the same manufacturer One of the best instrument cables within the brand,positive
Beautiful pedal nice chrome foot piece weighted so as to have a substantial feel quiet and rubber bottom so as not to slip around An allaround solid purchase for the low price I found on Amazon Love it Sustaining quality,positive
I bought it for my church and the drum sounds great I love The quality and the sound Buy it without doubts Excellent,positive
At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner but since Ive been using it for the past few weeks Ive yet to have one complaint It sits right atop clipped to the guitar operates on vibrations so doesnt pic up other guitars is light barely even notice it and seems quite accurate LOVE IT,positive
Im just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best I like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound The price is right Colorcoded for dummies like me,positive
Its so much easy to deal with your guitar using this string winder and cutter A w e s o m e Cool,positive
Just the perfect pick I was looking for Ive tried experimenting with several types of picks Finally found the right one Dunlop Tortex,positive
Dont get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable Theres a little more 34brightness34 to the output they are a little more longlasting and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal XL120 This is a good stringBut it looks like the going rate on these strings will be 12 bucks a set I can get three sets of regular excellent XL120 strings for that money and if the NYXL lasted 3 times as long then theyd be worthwhile but Ive been able to try them twice now and they dont last 3 times as longGreat string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced Noticeable Improvement but at what cost,neutral
Its a very solidly made stand Simple to assemble Perfect for my home studio holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard Im very happy with the purchase and the price was right Great for 88 keys in a home studio,positive
Im a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished I want them to be slick when I bend notes If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool it can wear down your frets These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them I think Amazon had the best price Safer and better than steel wool for your frets,positive
This issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design This is a Pedaltrain product and just like my Pedaltrain 2 this is a wellmade perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds 50 freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff And that my friends is the problemI am using a Voodoo Labs 4x4 power supply but had to also get a Tripplite Isobar 6 outlet power strip that I drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals I plug that into the wall and then use a homemade 834 iec power plug in the Voodoo On the pedal I was able to fit 2 Jim Dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a Crybaby Wah TC Electronic Flashback X4 Sparkbooster Mojo mojo overdrive Corona chorus Hall of Fame Reverb Ditto looper and the Shaker vibrato I also have the MXR flanger Helicon Harmony pedal for vocals a Korg tuner and an Electro Harmonix Pulsar tremoloI know I knowDid I mention this sucker is big I feel like they should name it the 34pedal porch34 Maybe I can put a few potted plants on itSo getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth I will ask you to ask yourself 34Do I really need all these pedals If the answer is 34Hell yes I deserve them all I worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds34 then by all means knock yourself out Just dont get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space No joke It might need its own zip code,positive
Just good ol genuine Fender parts Nothing to complain about here Im a stickler for the OEM parts so I typically by only Fender stuff Looks good fits good sounds good,positive
This was EXACTLY what I needed this being the 3rd compressor I bought I use it for vocals it drops bass a little is super quiet and has a mid range bump So happy I got this I got a used one and its in perfect condition so that was a bonus too Behringer rules Perfect,positive
The Behringer ACX450 is a good looking great sounding amp in a small package but should be used at low to medium volume At higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange and also use the antifeedback button to avoid a muddy sound from too much distorted bass This not an amp to play loudly but rather for lowtomid volume accompaniment in a smaller venueAs to the sound effects it is great with 16 effects covering reverb chorus delayecho and many combinations I especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel Also nice to have a separate XLR microphone input on channel 2The CDMP3 input is good for backgrounds or maybe drum machine when playing or music during breaks although one needs a cable with RCA plugs to connect it Lack of a headphone jack is a drawback but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offersOverall a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price if you dont plan to crank it up too much Great sound and effects at low to medium volume,positive
I bought this unit for a friend and I could compare with others overdrives I already have I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise There are better choices,negative
Im in a situation where I have to sit to play due to hip problems and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat For me a stool is too high and a folding chair too low plus I need something that folds in with my other equipmentOn its tallest setting this gives me the exact height I need Im 6 so it might not be high enough for a very tall personIt is also sturdy Im very animated when I play and the support feels solid after several gigs of 2 to 3 hours The cushioning is nice and thick as well Very good support,positive
When it comes to noise gates this definitely does the trick It had a noisedetection sensor so it knows when you are playing guitar or not and will turn itself on and off automatically This means that while youre not playing itll block that annoying static sound your guitar and pedals make and when you start playing itll lower itself so that it doesnt effect the noise of the guitar Itll sound the same I would defeinitely recommend Plus Behringer is the best brand for pedals Works very well,positive
Well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hoursI still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when its on its great Ive been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i cant seem to turn it offits light small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks its a great dealThis is a good EQ for an excelent price not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals a very nice EQ,positive
I just play at home with friends It works well so far on all my ukuleles However every time you touch your instrument its going to transmit that sound into your amp so its nothing Id be using on stage if I didnt have to Still it seems to be a good value but truth be told I havent had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue Time will tell works well for my purpose,positive
I wanted the version of this device with the builtin microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar Maybe I should just change the guitar pitch to my offpitch singing and I could finally achieve perfect harmony I like everything about it especially I think its ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life A well designed device Works Great and Has the Microphone Feature,positive
I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar My first cheap cord wasnt actually broken but I didnt want any down time so I had this just sitting there as a replacement Fast forward some time and I just wanted to try it out Even though my cheap cord was still working fine I really wanted to just try out the new cordI really wish I had done that in the first 30 days This cord did not work right at all It seems like there is a short in it somewhere I had to unplugplug maneuver into place Of course since it is for guitar it falls almost immediately out of place again So I am back to the cheap cord that hasnt failed unlike this brand new bad cable Broke almost immediately,negative
This mic fits my studio need perfectly Its USB connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity I would recommend one Great mic awesome price,positive
Very good product Bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1 It comes with a Daisy Chain power cord that eliminates the need for separate power supplies Foam inserts easily fit Boss and Behringer pedals but can be easily cut to house other pedals very good,positive
I was upgrading all the chrome on a MIM and put this on Looks better than the plain one Includes the screws Looks Great,positive
I like it got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use Thanks for getting it to me so fast and I recommend going through the vendor I received this from it works great Guitar Connection,positive
For anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind I mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used so I wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily Anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose Also I didnt want to have short 34 strapletts34 dangling from my guitars while its being displayed So for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes I get everything I wanted Quick release and reattach of the strap the piece of mind that its not going to just randomly drop one day And they come in all the standard finishes chrome black gold nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display I have these on all my guitars and always will As an added bonus once you have these on multiple guitars you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear Lock down that strap once and for all,positive
The 6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing I know people use yogurt containers credit cards bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks but for me the consistency of the Dunlop pick cant be beaten And the price is right too Just right for Mountain dulcimers,positive
The Fender medium is my second choice for picksMy first is the Just Strings pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer less scrape feel on the strings at half the pricePick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion Good picks but you might want to try these,positive
Been using these for longer than a decade and met many people who prefer minimal picks and jazz III among them This is the closest to playing with bare hand that I can get If you like small minimal picks check this out,positive
This gets the job done but because it is lighter you do a bit of 34chasing34 the guitar around All in all gets the job Works fine for the price,positive
I love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly The tuner picks up vibrations so it doesnt require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar Theres just one button so its idiotproof However the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soonSpeaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but I hate that they used the CR2032 battery It just doesnt last long and in Brazil its really hard to find this battery at all Great tuner but battery doesnt last so long,positive
Clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar Pluck a string and it will indicate what it is Turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done Takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar Mine is electric Works plugged in or unplugged Awesome,positive
I was previously using a Rocksmith USB Cable but wanted a specific cable for my iMac This unit definitely fits the bill and from what I can hear when playing has an even lower latency than the RS cable I was getting a little unwanted slapback with the RS cable but this unit seems to have taken care of that Its also quite nice to have a headphone jack right up front for quiet practice timesThe software that comes with this Interface is a joke and is about as useful as an AOL disc Since I use Logic Pro X and MainStage 3 it wasnt a loss to me but if you are buying this interface for the fact it comes with 34Amp Tones34 you might want to look somewhere else I couldnt even get the software to load on my 2013 iMac Great USB Interface But Plan On Throwing Software Into The Trash,neutral
I dont have a classical guitar but I just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a nonradiused fingerboard Ive also got over a dozen capos dont ask but all are for radiused fingerboardsThe fingerboards of most steelstring guitarselectric and acousticare radiused that is they are not flat They have a gentle curve to them so gentle that many wouldnt notice it unless they looked closely Look up fingerboard in the Wikipedia for an excellent discussion and Google images for diagrams and picturesEven though the curve is gentle if a fingerboard is radiused a capo must be curved too or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz If a fingerboard is flat like a classical guitars the capo must be flat too or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzzIf youre not sure whether your guitars fingerboard is radiused slide a ruler between two frets If it lies flat then so is the fingerboard If it rocks the fingerboard is radiusedI REALLY like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw This makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressurenot tool little which would cause strings to buzz and not too much which would cause the instrument to go out of tuneAs others have noted its one drawback is that it cant be clamped to the headstock when not in use But for that Id replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo HIGHLY recommended Classical guitar capo GREAT for nonradiused fingerboard,positive
I like the Dan Electrode but I noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect turned my Heavy Metal into a sick fuzz and my LavaBox into a primitive distortion and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustainOnerr Overdrive or volumeFrenchToast and thats it Its still a good 9volt power supply but the voltage drop feature doesnt always wow you Sometimes the magic works somtimes it doesnt,positive
I am very pleased with this music stand It is working well for me and it holds my very heavy music binders so far I would recommend it to others to try So Far So Good,positive
I have to say I was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but I was shocked at the sounds I could getIt took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone I wanted and off we wentFor the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone is worth twice as muchAs far as durability I have had in a month used it 10 times so far so goodI did purchase the protection plan for 10 so Im covered for 2 years Sounds amazing,positive

Hey jerks do you play guitar Well if you do you need strings Well you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar If so you can stop reading If you use strings you should buy them your damn self While youre at it buy ten sets Seriously are you a child Always have extra strings DAddarios last a long time for me and they sound good Also theyre on the bottom end of the price range Buy some strings douchnozzle Stringy strings,positive
Others that reviewed this Item I read before purchase noted it is not 34Large34 and the picks have to be warmed and shaped to fit your thumb I also found in original 34Large34 size The curve of the pick will cut into your thumb from improper shaping and being too small for the average American man I am still in the process of shaping all 5 but otherwise they appear sturdy and I havent broken more than one of similar type in several years I expect the pick to wear down from use They appear to be about the same quality as Indigo brand but not shaped as well for the average player Large Maybe if I were born in China,neutral
At this price these cables are a bargain The jury is still out on how durable they are but they all arrived in working order and have held up well despite several months of plugging and unplugging The length is great for when you have a bunch of pedals with inputs that vary from top to side I hate it when the patch isnt long enough and I have to misallign my pedals Anyway thumbs up Will revisit my review if they begin to fail soon So far so good,positive
I only have used this tuner on classical guitars the ones with nylon strings I teach classical guitar and have had the opportunity to use it on many different classical guitars of varying quality It has tuned them all very well A great advantage Ive found using this tuner Tune Tech TT500 verses tuners which use a microphone is that I can now talk with my students while tuning and no longer have to ask them to please be quiet while I tune their guitars Kids especially like to talk and now I can fully engage in conversation with them while tuning their guitars The only problem Ive noticed and thus only 4 stars is that I usually have to begin tuning with any string other than the low E string For some reason the tuner seems to have trouble sensing the low E vibrations and the needle will not move This problem has always resolved itself when I tune another string and then tune the low EPROS1 Pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2 Ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3 Small and compact4 Swivel head for ease of viewing the screen5 The screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight6 Rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7 Clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers8 Being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning EADGBE Its tuning range is 12 note A2 B79 Will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of nonuseCONS1 Delay on tuning low E string2 Buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string B3 Plastic on screen scratches easilyI dont yet know how long the button battery will last or how much battery replacements cost I will update this review when I have that information But for now I am very pleased with this tuner I have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all I have also used it to tune my guitarlele and it tunes it darn near perfectly Great chromatic tuner at a great price I love it Great Chromatic TunerI Love It,positive
This was a requested gift from my teenage son for Christmas and you shouldve seen the smile on his face that day Amazon made it easy,positive
I do like these picks too It has a bit different sound obtained when I use this one Will keep them Good pick,positive
They work as expected my problem is they blend in with my rug and if I drop them its a major effort to find them again Next time Ill go for a vibrant color Work fine when I can find them,positive
Purchased for hanging two rockband pseudo guitars Works great for that and for uke Would also be OK with guitarsThe nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitarlike instrument within reason The packaging is very basic you just get the product with no fasteners or instructionsThe hanger looks good is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments When solidly mounted the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments though I did not test thatFor the cost these are a smoking deal The alternatives I purchased for my music room heavy bass guitars cost about 2x more and are not necessarily any better functionallyAs mentioned there is no included hardware but that is a nonissue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wallboard fasteners depending on your situation and weight of your instrument So just plan on visiting the hardware store if you dont already have these in your shop I used wallboard hangers for one direct screws into joist for the other as it happens Great design quality appearance excellent price,positive
How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didnt need chorus at all This pedal is not like that not much to tweak but the chorus is great Sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords I even like it with the bass Just a great chorus with not much to tweak From a guy who doesnt like chorus I love this pedal,positive

I own a GLS ES58 and am very happy with it so when I need a mic for my guitar cab I went with a GLS57 and couldnt be happier These mics are very solid and I cant tell them from the real deal I have done side by side comparison of both the real 57 and knock off 57 mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak I doubt you would notice any difference I am about to purchase three more of these 57 mics for the rest of the bands intruments Great knock off of a shure 57,positive
I bought this because I had a gig in a dark bar I used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly For some songs I have three sheet of paper which overlapped about an inch and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots I cant imagine in what situation I would ever need to use the brighter setting I was thinking of getting the cheapersmaller version but didnt want to risk it not covering three pages The gig bag is a square and softly padded There is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so I dont expect much protection for the light or adapter Treat the light like it has no bag and youll be fine They include 3 batteries I didnt see them until I pulled out the adapter for this review to get you started using the light but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you shouldnt have to worry about it making it to your power supply Bright and 3 page coverage,positive
This tuner tunes my guitars very well it tunes them perfectly and works well tuning bass guitar very easy to use very visible screen when tuning clamps on nicely and the red color is very beautiful you could say all in all very good tuner Snark SN2 Tuner,positive
I usually play my Jazz Bass fingerstyle but there are songs where I prefer a pick especially when I need speed and accuracy Until I found the hard Wedgie rubber pick I used a heavy Fender pick but didnt like the sharp pick sound very muchI bought a set of soft medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and Im really happy with the results I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgies really nice for my Jazz Bass I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars but the Wedgies are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments I prefer the 31mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes but thats entirely subjectiveId love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday but it still works very well for me Helps produce a really nice soft finger picked sound on Bass,positive
I have no complaints except when I try to tune my guitar a half step down there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but I have zero clue how to use them This tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head swiveling head visible from wherever you are perfect tuner,positive
I own numerous Behringer products and have never had an issue with any of themThis item is well worth the money and the sound is awsome which is what you want Who cares if it is plasticI own a Behringer X VAmp Guitar Multi Effects Pedal and when I first plugged into it the quality of the amp models blew me awayTo the guy who said he received one with stripped out screws and to not even think about stepping on the pedal Dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with You should have been bright enough to just return it and ask for a replacement Second these are musical instruments You arent supposed to stomp on them like you are trying to crush them and grind them into the stage or where ever you play The term stomp box isnt supposed to be taken literally It simply means you push the pedal button with your foot Erego the word stomp Buy it,positive

I have played guitarbass for quite some time and have used numerous tuners ranging those those big Korg strobe tuners to my latest Sabine STX1100 I liked the big Boss TU1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situationsI was at a big jam in a nightclub around Christmas and saw a bunch of guys using clamp on tuners of varying brands and thought I would try one I looked at the Amazon offerings and after reading reviews settled on this one over the SN1 or SN2This is too easy and my guitar has never stayed in tune like this before It requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time The only thing I dont like about it is it doesnt really like the E string of my bass I dont think it picks up those long wavelengths so well I will try the SN8 shortly and give this one to a friendI do recommend this for guitarists because you will always be in tune no matter the tuning If you leave it on while soloing you can see what notes you are playing I am my own guitar tech as well as for a friend and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thingGet a Snark and you will be happyEdit I dont like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to The only place to clip is the very end and you are fighting tuning keys for space at that point If you can get it there comfortably it works but nothing like with a Fender or Gibson both which have plenty of space on the headstock Snark SN5 a great little tuner,positive
For years Ive used the supercheap rake hangers you can get at hardware stores the metal U coated in rubber with the heavyduty screw end These are fine except that some guitars dont want to fit and recently when trying to widen the mouth of one the weld failed and so the U detached from the screw partWell that got me to thinking that I should find a better solution for hanging my guitars The thing is I hate overpaying for things To me 1520 is way too much for a guitar hanger Sure its important to have something solid to hold our babies but I want to feel like Im getting some valueI bought 2 of these hangers and theyre rocksolid As others have said put some good screws into a stud dont bother with the hassle of the drywall anchors provided I just used some 2 drywall screws I like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to The U is easy to adjust for width the retainer rings slide on very easily and Ive tried both acoustic and electric guitars and all hang away from the wallNo complaints these are great the quality seems excellent and 9 seems just about right to me Very nice,positive
This stand is useful for small instrumentsfits my tenor uke and violin just fine Any bigger than that and the piece that holds the neck becomes too small like a baby martin guitar etc Hope this helps Fits violin or uke very well,positive
I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar Ive got it this weekend and Im very satisfied with this product Im not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions with complete addons on th webpage Solid nice sound very good quality to make anyone happy except your neighborsNow after a couple of months I want to say this is great product in terms of sound not so great in terms of small building detailsGreat for Blues style just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch and you will get amazing blues soundsMy only con and thats why I have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also the Phones are not working Better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen I wrote to Line6 and I got useless answers about Excellent for home great sound quality not so great in building,positive

This is the best shockmount in my opinion This is the first shock mount I have tried I bought it with a desktop mic stand and used it on my Audio Technica AT2020 and it worked very nicely It does the perfect job for podcasting as well as gameplay videos I would recommend this to anyone Best Shockmount,positive
the orig still the best do you like guitar music chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes it is the one my only stand alone outside a multi effects unit cry baby cry,positive
Like many say they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables They slip out,neutral
I received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar It is styled very much like the Kyser capos but cost about one third of what youd pay for a Kyser It is made of aluminum NOT ABS plastic as another reviewer suggested The spring is plenty strong enough to hold down all 6 strings with no problems The rubber pad is flat and this capo works well on guitars with a flat fret board I dont know how well it would work on a guitar with a curved radius fret board Im thinking it may not hold the high and low E strings down sufficiently to keep them from buzzing I could be wrong Keep in mind it is very important to fully depress the spring when moving the capo up or down the neck Sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo The wound strings will cut into the rubber like a file if you slide it on the strings I really havent had it long enough to see if it will stand the test of time but as the title of my review reads So far So good Its very reasonably priced and Im very pleased with it I rate it at 5 stars Its well worth the money Its very unlikely to break and if I find the rubber pad wears out prematurely I will update my review So far So good,positive
Better than Dunlop polish It really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine Mine didnt come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though I like this polish,positive
I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them If you need more control with EQ This pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket More versatile than the Sovereign Simply the best,positive

Weve been only using it for two days and so far so good I cannot say anything about durability for now but Ill update this review if it breaksOne of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin and I finally bought this for herThere are many clipon tuners but I liked the following about this tuner1 LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much youre off as opposed to just flat or sharp2 You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway but a mic sometimes comes in handy3 Can set different pitch than A4404 Not expensive was less than including shippingUpon delivery I tried it on my guitars both acoustic and electric using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid and was impressedIt is quick to track the note even for low E Its not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on No stress whatsoever indeed its just as quick and smooth as my BOSS LCD is bright and clear and needleish display works as expectedIt worked very well on violin too And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for funAnd a note about the looks From the picture I expected it to be ugly but actually it was not that bad Its tiny and doesnt look like a FisherPrice productFirst update Nov 24 2010 Ive tried it on an electric bass 4 string and it worked equally well Still 5 starsSecond update Oct 20 2011 Its still working happily for my daughter and I bought a second unit for myself Fantastic product Fast tracking tuner with good features,positive
This is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range Its warm and the modulation sounds great This is not a digital delay the echos will not be exactly what you play but that is why you get an analog delay so you hear the part just a little to the left Get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun carbon copy,positive
I have had this stand for over 2 years and still like its compact transport capability Since I purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand It is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping Ive used it at both inside and outside gigs without any problems Easy light to carry,positive
I have used D Addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel playability tone and reliability This set is no exception Light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone Highly recommend anything by D Addario DAddario is the best,positive
Compared to Ernie Balls cloth its good enough for wiping down things It is soft and non abrasive EBs cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs Overall good cloth for general use Nice cloth,neutral
I love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop It has two brightness settings Illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly Bright stays put,positive
Purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home I saw them used in a guitar shop so I assumed they were more than sufficient for use at home Im using them with both acoustic and electric guitars They appear to be designed to hang the guitar away from the wall to avoid abrasions on the back and they do just that The hooks can be stretched apart or squeezed together to fit the headstock of the guitar Overall they are attractive wellmade hangars Simple product great design,positive
it fits almost anywhere and looks cool holds all my drumstick and whatnot i would recommend it to anyone that needs a place for there sticks pretty cool,positive
The strings on my new Yamaha FG700S were too hard and noisy so I ordered these and what a difference in the feel Playing went from painful to pure pleasure I did notice that the tone of the low E string was a bit dead especially in drop D tuning so I put that one Yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows For that I gave four stars instead of five Soft and silky,positive
Pretty flexible due to the 060mm thickness I would recommend the Dunlop Max Grip picks over these picks The Max Grips have a much better gripPlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help Good picks with ok grips,neutral
I have some neurological problems with my picking hand and cant seem to hold onto picks I really like these Max Grips a lot and have found that they are excellent for soloing Great tone as well For my tastes they are are a bit stiff for strumming but perfect for everything else I love the size and wouldnt want anything larger The advantage of these over the Dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip you can still pick with them The Davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side I would say the Davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively I use the Dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing Cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic as Ive been on an electric fixation latelyAlso a fan of the regular Jazz IIIs and find they dont slip as much as my Dunlop Tortex picks I think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering Still in terms of grip they dont hold a candle to the Max Grips Both picks have their own unique tonal characterIve tried a variety of picks and I think that once you get used to smaller picks you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward These jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics They are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippyOverall these are my picks of choice for my style which is bluesoriented Surprised there are so few reviewsEDIT The strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle Its getting easier with these I have also since found that while these are fantastic picks I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack Red Nylon138mmdespite lack of the MaxGrip raised lettering They are just the most wonderful picks Ive used I do plan to try out some 2mm picks however as I suspect Im going to prefer a thicker pick the III nylons feels slightly thicker than the MaxGrips which I believe is why I prefer them My favorite picks so far,positive
I always like to carry extra cable when performing you dont know when one of the one you have breaks and you dont have extras what do you do then it works and its great to have extra ffsalsayahoocom,positive
For the money CHEAP this is worth getting The loop feature is quite good the delayecho entirely satisfactory Not as good as say a BOSS unit but they cost 5x as much Great for everything from slapback to long delay with heapbig repeats available The plastic housing might not standup to the road Having the 9v adapter input on the side behind the in jack rather than the back seems wise Ive read some negative press about Behringer pedals but personally cannot complain Behringer DD400 Guitar Delay Effect Pedal,positive
If youre looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely Leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars My only complaint is that it is difficult to attach at first holes are smaller than usual probably an anomaly So for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather Nice price,positive
This is the American DJ Micro Galaxian red green laser It is the smaller version of the Galaxian laser with the same laser power output but a smaller beam spread It is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool The small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord It comes with a remote that works great but has an antenna to pull up if needed which seems like old technology The remote has 4 buttons which allows you to select autosound mode blackout color and direction of rotation When going through the color modes you can select red green redgreen together or redgreen changing and flashing You can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music There is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely move very fast or slow The darker the room the better but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on I am very pleased with it I havent tried it with fog but I know it would look great since it has 200 beams It will work great for any DJ to use on the dancefloor wall or ceiling This is a great buy under 100PROS It is small bright well built and works great It has a remote to control itCONS Transformer on cord and antenna on remote Excellent affordable laser,positive

I have been using this since the day it arrived it was very easy to setup although windows 8 reads the device as a speaker so the USB does not work for me that way It has a great sound and I am very pleased with it perfect for home studio,positive
This light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely The light from the LEDs has a blue tint to it Id prefer something more white Each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting I gave 4 starts because it doesnt get quite as bright as Id like but it does the job It seems wellmade and will operate off battery power as well as an AC adapter which is included Not quite as bright as I had hoped,positive
I do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a LP case I have bought a lot of stuff here on AZ so looked at this one and had it shipped to him He says its great so that is my reviewPrices are always great on AZ and Prime saves me money in shipping4 stars is my tops anywhere Epiphone case,positive

Have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar like them and never an issue nice bright tone and last agood long while trusted and familiar,positive
I purchased this pedal recently a bit skeptical with such a low price tag however I was completely impressed with it I dont use a tremolo effect often but when I do I just need some subtle shimmering swells This box does the trick Construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis The knobs feel sturdy enough and the button seems strong by the way it is true bypass which is nice It doesnt seem to affect my tone when I kick it on no volume or tone changes just the tremolo effect And silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board I dont know if I will purchase other joyo effects but I am impressed with this one 5 stars excellent tremelo,positive
I own three of these and have them attached to the back of my headstocks Great idea great concept and great quality Only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that I have recently adopted Dunlop Jazz III the Dunlop MaxGrip Jazz IIIs and my Dava Jazz picks just wont stay in there without slipping outFor regular sized picks its a perfect product For smaller sized picks I improvise by using SD card cases perfect fit for jazz picks 5 stars for normal size picks but 1 star for jazz picks,neutral
I wanted to experiment with a thin pick I like the action but thinner picks tend to click over the strings and I dont care much for that These are certainly pretty though and the feel is typical Fender celluloid smooth and a little slippery Might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers Celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke I dont A pick is a pick,neutral
I am very pleased with the quality of this stand It is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less It shipped on time and the packing was good Great Stand at a Great Price,positive
Fits very well on my les Paul 100 Very good sound and feel,positive

Works well easy to install and take out Helps greatly to control acoustic feedback Ive looked at these for a while glad I purchased it Great item,positive
I have been using an app on my cell phone until I purchased this from Amazon This thing is awesome Its so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it Oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound It does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark But the more I use it the better feel I get for it If you dont have one get one Pretty cool little device,positive
Kenny Wayne Shepherd Blue On BlackNail the lead use a Strat in the neck positionGets close enough to fake it for a club bandSounds pretty close to the more expensive models from Chicago IronThis pedal will save you 300 or more from the CI model and its close enoughSome are concerned with the switches I am running it in an FX loop pedal so it rarely gets the button pushed anymoreI have the Joyo Ultimate OD also nice pedal I think I like this little company Nice pedal great price,positive

Ive been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way Well Ive never noticedTo me these always feel perfect Also you can adjust which part of the sweep youre using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the potIve tried other wahs Morley doesnt do it for me and the Vox is very good I just have always gone with what I knew No complaints with the Crybaby The best,positive
I started out wilth Balls when I first picked up the guitar in 1968 when I was 17 They were worth my part time minimum wage money and gave me what I wanted A very reliable product that took me through the transition from an amateur to a professional lead guitarist I highly recommend them Keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag Balls Rock,positive
I love these picks for playing my acoustic They give such a nice crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic For me I prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric probably a 70 or 80 but I still like the tortex picks for that as well And these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply Been Using these for Years,positive
As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate But its important to replace them every month or two even if you hear no problem with the current strings Playing on fresh strings is the best experience everThese Blue Steel light strings sound like gold The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch Probably better than any other light strings Ive bought They needed to be tuned often before they settled in but all new strings do I havent used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up but Ill be updating in a month or so So far they are great Definitely recommended The difference is shocking,positive
What can I say Its a cable Its cheap and it works as advertised Much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops Gold tips yeah right Cheap and it works,positive
Expect less for that price Excellent fine manufacturing good finish Perfect for my Line 6 75 wt It works well at all heights A surprise,positive
great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the Ps i dont know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue great,positive
This is a pretty good stand for the price I ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as I prefer the telescoping booms I have the Dr Pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is BT4 For the price this is a good value good stand,positive
Study strap Great feel leather matches my instrument well 21234 width worked well for me compared to the 434 version Great Strap,positive
This was an excellent purchase Beside having a great range of audio pickup the mic is so versatile Great product Great Mic,positive
I needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs I went to the large Guitar store and tried out several in this price range and couple hundred above and settled on this one because of the sweet sound and workmanship For the money I dont think it can be beat Mahogany not plywood sides and back and Cedar top make for a really nice mellow tone and a bone nut and saddle thrown in for good measure Bone does make a considerable difference I have found All the finish is excellent Now for some down sides Yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends As for leveling it seemed OK So I took some time and masked off the fret board and finished the frets flush with the fingerboard and rounded the sides and tops Cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it You can make your own clear plastic pick guards to any size by going to Wal Mart and in the material sewing department you will find clear plastic in large rolls You can buy a half yard long x 54 and make enough pick guards to last a life time for a couple bucks It clings to the gloss finish nicely Do not use this on old guitars with Nitro finish it will eat the finish instantly Same goes when changing strings Put some masking tape at the end of the bridge on the top to prevent the strings from scratching the Cedar top Overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down I put a Baggs IBeam pickup in it also Easy installation and nice natural sound It is nice as it does not have a big EQ cut into the side of the body VERY NICE PLAYING AND SOUNDING,positive
Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings and these are toward the light end The sound is bright but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings LightMediumThe custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the LightMedium Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics If you strum harder they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent changing the tone for the same reason a bend would If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant oneOn the other hand compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound the brightness can make an instrument sound quite goodDepending on your style these might be a good choice If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable these might seem more at home If you are used to Martin medium strings but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things you might like these too but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale oneI wouldnt say I dislike these and I wouldnt quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs But as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from Martin But its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique A lightweight contender,neutral
Have used them for months with no failures Decent quality ends and build Theres really nothing else to say about them and Im saying it now to reach the minimum length requirement Buy some now No duds,positive
I use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and IT WORKS PERFECTLY Very minimal buzz LLLOVE IT PERFECT,positive
These are great for connecting effects pedals I really dont know how else you would do it in a small space without making your pedal box look like a plate of spaghetti Great for connecting effects pedals,positive
This is fine as a general stickon inexpensive pick holder It doesnt hold very many picks but it really doesnt have to I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chainpick holder over this It costs more but has more functional value to me If all you need is something very simple and you have a surface you can stick it on then this is fine I like the Planet Waves pick key chain more,positive
Does what its suppose toonly giving it 4 stars because they should have a multiple preset switch available rather then only letting you do one Works well,positive
The ZT Lunchbox is some sort of new technology that allows LOUD and GOOD sounding tone to come through a box the literal size of a lunchbox I was amazed at how small the amp was when I first purchased it tiny Then I was amazed at how LOUD it could be and still have clean headroom Others have reviewed and written about a hissing sound but I have not had a problem with that After trying it with 3 guitars 1 passive pus 1 active pus and 1 acoustic electric it remains nice and quiet I have been using it as a practice amp as well as in a band settingNow heres the thing it does NOT have a lot of bass frequency to it but I noticed that setting it on the floor does help some but still not enough if youre looking for that heavy metal scooped sound So I would not recommend it for you metal heads out there however for all you jazzers and rockers the tone knob makes a big difference I keep my tone at about a 9oclock setting because I prefer a little darker sound and it has enough mids to cut through the mix nicely stillBottom line I would recommend this amp obviously I gave it 5 stars I dont think you will be dissappointed Great Little Amplifier,positive
It works fine if it will reach your equipment three more inches would be nice If it will reach its great Length,positive
Everyone has there opinions I was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of John What I can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days They slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time Sound really nice on my Taylor 410CE Seem to be quality strings,positive
Not happy with the sellers description or the product The description says Heavy Duty which makes you assume that its a regular hard plastic Mic Clip but its not ITS RUBBER It sucks Used it a couple times and its hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how its probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly and flex ITS FLEXIBLE Who uses Flexible Mic Clips Make sure you dont buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead BEWARE Its not a hard plastic Mic Clip its Rubber,negative
Yes I finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock It never needs to be removed Its accurate Its easy to use Its lowprofile Highly recommended Finally,positive
Unlike some other reviewers I have found no quality issues with mine it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesnt smell like anything it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove all I need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut rotate the harp away from my mouth and lift the frame over my headTo change out harps bite down on your harp use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut Holds the harp exactly where I need it,positive
I am confused by this hellish portal of confusion Looking at it makes me ill I feel like its laughing at me with its indecipherable scribbles Its a diabolical reference thingiemadoodle for the geniuses among us,neutral
This device works Heres what it does You plug an electric bass into the pedals instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedals high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp You also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack out You can use just the highimpedance output or just the XLR output or you can use them both simultaneously When the footswitch is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box When the footswitch is on an LED light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on I put footswitch in quotes because I use fingers to push it but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose When you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using itSome other functional comments about it It runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9volt power supply I used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter Battery life isnt super but satisfactory Still if using it a lot I suggest using an AC adapter When the battery starts going it sounds awful but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set Also when the footswitch is off and the LED is not lit this thing functions as a straight XLR ouput direct box for anything you plug into it You could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass so just use it as a direct box with the toneemulation circuit off for anything except bassThe controls are all rotary knobs except the GroundLift switch which is a slide switch The controls left to right top row to second row are DRIVE TREBLE BASS LEVEL PRESENCE GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLENDTaking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed The DRIVE knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness or edge of overdriven tube tone Basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose There is no ACTIVEPASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want The TREBLE knob is a or 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones The BASS knob is a or 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies 12 oclock is flat or zero db boost or cut on both the treble and bass knobs The LEVEL knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration The PRESENCE knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone The Presence knob isnt a midrange control but does boost the upper mids The GROUND LIFT switch only effects the XLR output jack and it should be left OFF unless you hook it up and there is hum Then you can turn the Ground Lift ON and it might help eliminate the hum issue However it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum The BLEND knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedals output with all the way to the left being none 12 oclock being 50 and all the way clockwise being 100CONS Very little bass gear or anything else is PERFECT these days Behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using Chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down Designed in Germany but built in China means you get Chinese components and Chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing For example at the first battery change the battery clip selfdestructed as part of the clips terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip This was a Duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries Went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint Ive never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard Construction is all plastic The casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes I know not to use my size 13D foot on it The Treble and Presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed Basically I set the Treble and Presence to the point where I hear hiss start then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit Hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off The jacks other than the XLR are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal These type jacks are noted for causing problems especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time This unit lacks any dedicated MIDRANGE knob but the Presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously Some people who use this pedal as a stagetool use it as a solo or scoop switch for slap tap solos so the presence bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anywayPROS First and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely This isnt a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver by any means but works in a similar fashion to one I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use at gigs The Tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the Behringer cost I use the Behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home If I didnt have the Tech 21 unit I might take this unit to gigs but it probably will last way longer the way I keep it setup at home all the time I especially like this unit when used with small rehearsalpractice type combos Many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious Part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you dont get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp It is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline say anything over about 18 feet For recording the XLR direct out is very useful and the XLR direct out can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amp doesnt have a XLR direct outHow I use this device I have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer The output from microphone mixer is patched into a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard in an XP computer I can then record using the computers recording software practice solo or I can play along to recorded music using headphones With headphones I can play as loud as I want anytime that I want without disturbing anyone Most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass so I recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers You can buy better computer speakers that are capable but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp Quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capableHaving owned this pedal for about 4 years and knowing what I know about it I would buy it again I would strongly recommend it as a home recordingpractice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong For home use it is fine You can use it at gigs but Id be saving up gig bones to buy something more durable with better performance IT WORKS OKBUT HAS DUBIOUS DURABILITY,neutral
It hums crackles and I think Im having problems with my equipment As soon as I use any of my other cords then the problem is gone Hosa makes some other products that have good value But based on my experience I dont recommend this one I have bought many cables and this one is the only one that gives me problems,negative
I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars One was in the SKB Fender case 9995 on Amazon the other in this Gator case purchased locally I was told it was just as good as the Fender case Both ended up in checked luggage After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back nonstop minimal handling the glue on the top section gave up The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape but after having the padding fall out I just ordered another SKB Fender case The Gator will be reglued and used only for local trips The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on Not bad not good,negative
This is the best capo we have out of three We were not unhappy with the others until we received this oneProsEasy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tuneEasy to put on the guitar Although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they dont buzz it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fretNice pick holder featureThe micro adjuster is easy to adjust It turns smoothly and is kept in place by the springConsNoneThis is the capo to get The best capo in our house,positive
I read several reviews before purchasing these strings Ive never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic it sounded great They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is If youre wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings definitely give these a try The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board Great tone,positive
These are some bright stringsI play with a pick and mostly stay in the realm of rock n roll so no comments on the slapping and popping claims the packaging makes but there are plenty of great rock tones to be found Heck crank the amp and dig in with a pick and these would be great strings for any Motorhead covers youre planning on playing Good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets as Rotosounds and theyre only a Jackson not a bad string Great for the price,positive
Im just getting into miking and recording music mainly to get my son off to a good start Im kind of feeling my way When I wasnt getting a good result from a dynamic mic a friend suggested a preamp andor a condenser mike I ended up getting both the AMP tube preamp and running this through the AMP into my Tascam DP008 WOW I have to work on getting the levels matched properly but this thing is just SO much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar Our music sessions have slowed down a bit he just turned 16 so hanging with the Old Man is the LAST thing on his mind LOL but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable Includes a nice hard plastic carrycase too For this kind of money you cant really go wrong WAY hotter than dynamic mic,positive
For whatever reason I excpected the tin to be a little larger then what it is I thought the size of an Altoid tin I was thinking I could not only store the fifteen Beatles picks but also store my hundred other picks in the tinIt is very nice looking tin and the picks are cool well worth the just under 800 price tag I may order another one with different print on the tin but it is a small tin Just a little larger than a zippo lighter Neat but a little smaller then expected,positive
The strap looks great Very cool design and looks good on my tele And all for 7 bucks w prime shipping So why only 3stars This is my fourth strap purchase from Planet Waves I have grown to love Planet Waves straps for their comfort and durability and obviously the designs I thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design Mainly because at my local music shops I have never seenfelt a Planet Waves strap that was NOT made out of their usual thick soft and durable materialwhatever that might be that I have grown to love This strap is VERY thin and brittle feeling which makes it very uncomfortable to use This strap DOES slide easily on your shirt which is what I prefer but once it makes contact with your neck it is SHARP and it makes your neck sore and itchy Needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on Ouch I have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in But it is still as sharp as it was out of the package Maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up That is if it lasts that longOverall what you need to know is that this strap is NOT the same as the other Planet Waves straps The material is very thin and brittle feeling unlike the many other straps from Planet Waves If comfort is not important to you then get this strap The price cant be beat and will give your guitar that 70s look If I would have paid 20 on this strap I would be furious But at only 7 this strap is still a steal My Fourth and WORST Planet Waves Strap,neutral
I bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build This works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply I would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal It was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables My board looks great works well and I love this power supply Excellent,positive
Hard to day too much but it works great No issues to speak of It does the job perfectly well worth it,positive
This is a sweet guitar strap I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it These are very durable straps that wont fall off your guitar so you can play confidently They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but its expected since its new My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since Ive used it for awhile So its get better as you use it Besides it being uncomfortable at first its an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar Great and stylish D,positive
I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this But its a nice cable No noise or hum whatsoever Nice cable,positive
Although it is touted for acoustic guitars it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acousticelectric The spring is tough and it holds securely On and off is a quick process if you have the handfinger strength to operate it I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and havent had a chance to use it much But I like it so far It was delivered quickly It does the job Ill update after Ive had it for awhile Solid quick and almost easy,positive
Ive used mine on my electric and acoustic guitars and it is easy to use quick to reposition frets the strings properly It is cost effective and looks good Nice to have a color option not the usual black that everyone else seems to haveI need a wider one for my 52mm classic guitars neck that is also flat This capo cannot work with itIf I lost it I would definitely get another just like it Works good looks good,positive
You have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal the only think I can think of is moderately high power consumption so I suggest using the power supply rather than batteriesIt is a joy to play almost any style with these though I prefer jazzblues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortionOh yes the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks Very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range super nice reverb for either trad spring sound or more modern realistic DSP verb,positive
A simple device yet so useful I hate changing strings without one anymore Dunlop provided an inexpensive winder thats durable The right tool for the job,positive
Easy to install these buttons on the guitar Well made and just what I was looking for Thank you very much Good buttons,positive

The cable tangles easily Not stiff enoughIt gets in the way and is hard to stay stretched out But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types It also seem tightly put together at the ends Fare,neutral
I like DAddario strings but these did not impress me They are not worth the extra cost in my opinion I wasnt impressed,neutral
I like these pics I use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin good for fast strumming etc they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto I would buy them again good pics,positive
These cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors And they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do which is why I replaced them I suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision These mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost Good Quality Cable,positive
Bright easy to read display adjusts to face any direction so I can even use it with my Telecaster which has very little room on the headstock Accurate and fast Cant beat the price and battery compartment is easy to open unlike some other tuners I have Great tuner,positive
Obviously these arent top of the line strings but I used them to record a track in drop C and it sounded awesome After about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skinDaddario is awesome if you keep in mind that theyre on the cheaper side Nice cheap strings,positive
If you are an electric guitar player you know how it is you think you are finished with your pedal board but in a few weeks you are back at it searching for another effect but this means trial and error and a busy wallet the solution may be this Zoom MS50G this unit is like having 50 stompboxes to use on demand without having to change out your board here are some the things I like most about this pedal1 Small footprint same size as most single stompboxes of today2 The digital effects are very very good most have an almost analog quality to them3 Ability to create and save your own patches ordering them for stage use4 Good tuner included I found it to be very accurate and easy to use if you already have a tuner then you can open up another slot5 Great price considering 50 effects this thing costs no more than a single stompboxThe unit is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it however I will say it takes some work to get a handle on everything and the manual isnt a great deal of help But with just a little work and resolve youll be dialing in some new soundsI have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the MS50G Zoom has a reputation of creating quality effects units at very reasonable prices theyve done it again with this pedal I highly recommend it if you have one slot on your pedal board but dont know which pedal should fill it one thing to note that was frustrating at first most of the ODs and Distortions are preset with the levels way too high for output to a tube amp once you put these pedals in your own patches you can permanently save them with appropriate levels just be prepared to cut the levels down right away when trying out ODs and Distortions or you will likely get some very unpleasant feedback Pleasant Surprise Good Pedal,positive

I have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal The kick mics base is beginning to fall apart but I have used these things on the road all this brutal summer and the sound is still the same I have other more expensive mics but often use these in clubs as a backup when the drummer doesnt have a favorite or bring his own kick mic While it cannot stand up to say my favorite the D112 it does the job and the overheads are the easiest oh mics I have tried yet The tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece except for the kick mic mounting bracket after months of use I would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive micsUPDATE Now that I have been using them for a while I can say they are reliable durable and sound good My AKG drum mic kit sees more action than the Pyles but the Pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs micing The kick drum mics mount is falling off but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians they are in great shape These mics have more life left and I have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point Good sounding mics,positive
This pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from From subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only 40 And its built tough like a good effects pedal should be full metal case and solid construction an all around great buy Great on a budget,positive

This tuner is great and it being so low price makes it even more better standard shipping took 2 days to reach me in Mass I was pleased for that The tuner comes with a 2032 circle battery and its as simple as pushing the power button and strumming the guitar strings Id definitely recommend this product to a friend Id buy it again Its a nice little tuner and my guitar is sounding great This is a very well made product Awesome low price tuner,positive
Very handy I just slip this into the sound hole hook it up to my amp and then when I finish playing I slip it back out This is handy when I practice at night when my wife is sleeping Great,positive
I used this on my bass which up until recently I was trying to tune by ear I had it close but its the fine tuning that really helps This tuner really opened my eyes to how much even being a little bit off can change the sound I am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one But the tuner was a snap to figure out and I had my bass tuned in less than a half hour Easy to use and drasticly improved the tone,positive
Guitar picks What can I say I bought these along with my first guitar so its not like I have a preference But they come in a pack of 10 so there are plenty of spares when you lose them and you will Definitely good enough to start with until you gain enough experience to know the difference between all the many kinds of picks Great starter pack,positive
I bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles I ownThe first ukelele was a Lanakai LU21 It installed pretty easily except the adhesive lost its adhesion after I moved the pickup to a new location within the soundbox I need to get some stronger carpet tape or new adhesive to secure it more permanently in its new location It sounded great though several people commented on how loud and sweet the instrument sounded through a guitar amplifer and also through a mixer amp and PA system We did have to boost the gain on the mixer significantly to get adequate volume but we were able to project enough sound to do a dance for about 100 people Straight into a guitar amp it gave plenty of volumeHappy with the results I then installed a second one in a Mahalo paintedeconomy ukelele available here on Amazon The installation went well except the endpin jack wouldnt stay put in the sound hole On my Lanakai this was not a problem there is a ragged washer which goes on the inside of the endpin jack which is supposed to bite into the wood on the inside of the instrument It is supposed to stop the endpin jack from turning when you screw on a strap pinbolt onto the endpin jack from the outside of the instrument On the Lanakai this raggededged washer bit into the softer mahoganylike wood easily and did its job very well On the Mahalo which is a smooth maple or pine the ragged washer couldnt bite into the wood As a result the endpin jack turned and turned when I tried to screw on the outer boltstrap button and never went on tight enough I had to put masking tape around the end pin jack to make it fit snugly in the hole I created in the end block of the ukelele THEN there was enough resistance to allow me to install the strap buttonend bolt very tightlyMy biggest beef with this unit is the fact that it takes a 1532 hole to fit it snugly in the ukelele This is an odd size so you end up using a 716 drill bit which is common in most handyman drill bit sets Because this is too small you have to make the hole 132 larger by whatever means you have available This was an agonizingly slow process when I tried to do it by hand using a dowel with sandpaper wrapped around it A peghole reamer might have done a better job but I didnt have oneSo I eventually found a dowel and glued some sandpaper to it shoved it in my drill press and slowly lifted my 716 hole in the ukelele into the spinning sanpaper dowel This took care of the sizing problem in a matter of seconds although it was not a really tight fit and necessitated the use of masking tape around the endpin jack in the Mahalo to stablize it in the holeAlso the directions dont tell you much about the placement of the 3 nuts 2 flat washers ragged washer and strap buttonbolt that goes on the end of the jack I did it his way starting from the inside of the ukeleleBolt1Bolt2thin washerragged washer WALL OF THE UKELELE outer thick washer outer bolt3 outer strap pinbolt The purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2 This sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which I installed the pickupOverall when played through different guitar amps as well as a mixerampPA system I was pleased with the results of this unit in a ukelele I would buy another if I needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument Good sounding pickup through an amplifier,positive

This strap looks really great and fits just as advertisedits just that it gets in the way for Me and my chording skills mounted as designed and shown I altered the mounting manner to accomodate MY style and it functions fineLooks great too High quality and compliments the Martin Name and reputation really well I feel that its a good deal and recommend it Great looking Strap,positive
The Epiphone Les Paul guitars dont particularly sound that great but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar but youre not completely sure if they will stick with it if you can spend another 100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele The reason for this is because for 1 if they decide its not something they want to do anymore you can resell it at the same price you bought it for as long as it is still in decent condition and little no money is lost Second if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a 34better34 or more high end guitar Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still Ill never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this Stays in tune better,negative
I guess I have tried about every type of pick around Thick ridged things with thin strumming edges great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side Look this is just easy the star hole means I grip it and it doesnt move until I let go Never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the pick pen on the counter of the local music store trying to find 3 that feel right Yup 3 cause they were three for 100 Why didnt I think of this,positive
This gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the more me setting Its simple easy to use Works great Great personal monitor,positive
I am completely blown away with these headphones The second I got them in the mail I plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song Simply put it was amazing I was able to hear EVERY single track individually I later plugged the ATHM50s into a Korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results The sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing I have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and I keep coming back I have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source Make no mistake the ATHM50s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic A Complete Steal,positive
I used to use 009 to 032 and decided to up it a size to the 010 I like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound The heavier gauges such as 11s are okay too but the 012s seemed to be used a lot for the chop rhythm which I dont ascribe to At one point I did have a set of Bluegrass 012s on it but they didnt feel right for me plus I didnt like the way the 012s sat on top the nut I was a bit worried that the nut would crack which is what happens when the gauges are too fat for the nut slotIF you want 012s I would highly recommend you take it to a tech so he can evaluate the nut and slot it to the proper width to accommodate the 012The reason I switched from 009 to 010 is that I was hard pressed and in need of a set and the local music shop didnt carry the 009s any longer so I went to the 010 I believe my mando was set up with 10s or 11s but I wasnt sure I tweaked the action and the 010s are fine and Ive made the adjustmentStrings ahem are just about all the same They local music shop is very knowledgeable and they told me a story around NAMM shows and how the string booths dont really give out too much info and the origins of their products There may be according to the my local music shop a few companies that actually make their own strings but the bulk of the strings out there are probably manufactured in a mass quantities at factories in PRC or other offshore sources sold in bulk and packaged by the companies Who knows And the shop sure tried to find out but its a dark dark secret out there at the trade shows so nobody is talking and making a logical assumptions from a corporate standpoint are probably not too far off the mark ie Strings are mass produced for market and most string companies as I said earlier are buying bulk and packaging for the consumersWhat does that mean That means I need some inside info to this bulk purchasing and Ill sell my own The quality is probably up as much as the tooling and raw materials will allow so why notCheers 10s work,positive
Works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle I have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes Not so this one It is a great reliable tuner Great tuner,positive
Ive been using GLS cable for years now and I never had a problem with it Theyre good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it Good Quality Cable,positive
I only use Dunlops For a number of reasons First the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to Second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to Thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions Two thumbs up Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick I use the 60mm 48mm and 38mm sizes Dunlops rock,positive
I love these picks The flex is just right for me and they last forever I have never had one break Favorite pick,positive
I use this ALL the time Its pretty basic but really good for a beginner Not all chords are in here but the 34core34 chords are Worth the price Use this A LOT,positive
This guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box I am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth I am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture So expect it to be a different color than what you order See customer picsIt comes with strings installed and almost tuned The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that youre not going to accidently hit it while strumming My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when Im playing hard but maybe Im just a novice I will say that its very easy to playEverything on it is very adjustable which I also like The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is youre going to be addicted to it Theres a reason it receives 5 star,positive
This saved med at least 40 instead of getting a traditional preamp Best invention ever Also portable Downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but I keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff So convenient,positive
This pedal is beyond loud Its to the point where if you crank this pedal with a 15 watt amp with an 834 speaker you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood To match it up with the clean tone that I get out of my amp I have to set the level in between 1 and 2 You must take the time to find your tone with this pedal,positive
Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone And this with that extra filter on it it blocks even more Its simply amazing Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter If I want I can blow directly into the filters and itll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves Works wonders,positive
I have used DAddario EJ16 PB lights for years I find them hard to beat for quality and sound and will continue to use them on all my guitars DAddario strings,positive
Ok Ive owned 2 of these Danelectro amps For one they are cheap in price loud in output and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap Bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon Recently I purchased this item on ebay for 10 Bluetooth Audio Music Receiver V30 Wireless Stereo Adapter For Smart PhonesNow I can connect to my tablets smartphones and computers and use this amp as a great external Bluetooth speaker Plus the battery life is great Try to buy a BT speaker on amazon with this wattage thats cordless and works from battery power and you will spend well over 200The included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes I installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay and it lasts foreverPlus I can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when I want for this price its hard to beat My 2nd N10B amp now its a LOUD Bluetooth speaker,positive
Yes it costs considerably more than the SM58 and Im not sure if I could pass a comparison test between the two but I love this mic To me it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s I have used in the past If you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet get the 58 If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost go for the Beta I would buy this again My Favorite Mic,positive
Did not hold the strings down very well for me I love the feel of it but the spring needs more power Did not like,negative
I got this pedal cause is not so expensive and I love music I used to play in big concerts but no more but I can tell you that for the price is good who ever wants to have some fun and learn how to use a pedal good,positive
I heard about these from a friend several years backI teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship servicesThese strings allow me to keep on keepin on for several weeks at a time even with constant usageI wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions Longest Lasting Strings,positive
I bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold Shure SM57 and SM58 However my two mics came with Shure clips to my surprise These clips are 116 in from front to back In comparison the Shure clips are 14 in to 18 in from front to back So the Shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well good mic clip,positive
Think it sounds like a trash can lid No it doesnt It sounds like a crappy china which has its place in the rehersal studio for one Want a really good china Spend more money Thats how it works Great for practicing Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone Poor on recordings unless youre looking for that theres always an application For 20 though cmon What do you want Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad Its 20 It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where theyve been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3500 years and you got one for 20 Or go buy a K Kustum and quit your sniveling I say get one get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china boyah 20 for a china 5 stars off the bat,positive
definitely recommend these over any other string trees I used both one for DG and BE required some minor drilling so I had a guitar tech do it for me just to be safe recommended,positive
The grip is excellent But I prefer the 114 Sharps over these These are sturdy and look like I wont be needing another set for quite some time Same material as Jazz III Yellow,positive
I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft lintfree rag and it would act like a polish The finish sparkled afterwards even in the light Great product Great for cleaning acoustics,positive
these are the best strings around last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern good stuff,positive
I wasnt sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable but I am now it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the ampI did a little experiment I plugged in my old cable played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers Then I turned the amp off unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable Next I simply turned the amp back on the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them and played my guitar again The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cableIm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables Im a believer,positive
Some have complained that its construction is not the best I actually had to send the first one back because it did not work But a new one came the day after I lodged a request for a replacementIts a very simple echo device I use just to give my guitar a little bounce I prefer to play dry most of the time so as to define better what Im doing But some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle It can do a lot more but its what I wantedSturdy enough well priced and simple to use Its what it says it is,positive
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board the flexibility is awesome you can wind it underneath and around the pedal board and still plug it in to the pedals with out straining Perfect,positive
This item was received well packed and on time Provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks Great For the Price,positive
the effect it self is fine but it is too noisy even though u dont dime it for the price and for this product it is u get what u pay for too noisy,neutral
I can become VERY creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settingsI have other musicians online who jam with me and I can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where I am going with a songSo many things I have developedGreat tool and good quality product Great Pedal,positive
Im very satisfied with the performance of the CM2 With a few tweaking I could emulate the sound I get from my Fulltone OCD Id say its very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the Tone control A toggle switch lets you choose between classic modified setting A tweakers delight The level knob has a lot of juice If you set it at 10 or 11 oclock its plenty loud enough Although you cant use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the gain knob to zero If you have a single coil it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up not so for humbuckers too much gain You can also stack the CM2 with other pedals I dusted my old Boss DS1 and run it along with the CM2 and was able to get some good tones The DS1 usually hurts my ears but with the CM2 behind it sweet The Hardwire CM2 may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from Klon Zvex or LovePedal but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost Its well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to There may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good Try it you cant go wrongUPDATE Did a full comparison between the CM2 Fulltone OCD Joyo Crunch DistortionGAIN Joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the CM2 and OCD 3rdMIX The CM2 has the most amount of control with separate high low controls followed by the OCD with just a tone control and the Joyo Crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control Since the CM2 has the widest tone range I can make it behave like a Treble BoosterNUANCE The OCD cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic The CM2 is a close second and the Joyo Crunch being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind Versatile,positive
Theres a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these and if it doesnt it should This is a great all purpose dynamic mic I use it for instruments vocals even field recording sometimes The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals but that doesnt mean that the 57 cant handle a voice Theyre pretty much the same mic as far as Im concerned and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think youll find the same thing And if youre operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably then you probably already know what youre looking for Ill be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon but if youre like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics you cant go wrong here Its an SM57 whats there to say,positive
I use this short stand for micing my guitar amp cabinet It is pretty small and on the edge of light duty but I wouldnt call it cheap or crappy The adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably I dont use it for giging so it isnt getting beat on but it seems to be a pretty good mic stand and the price was great I also purchased a musicians gear similar mic stand which was a few dollars more I think I prefer the musicians gear unit becuase its a bit beefier than this one but I still like this stand and it was a great value This unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some Both are perfect for home recording and practice studios likely even hold up to some giging Great short mic stand for the cost,positive
I got this several years ago and I was pleasantly surprised by it really was nice with my acoustic to raise some volume on my soundhole pickup before the direct box I gave it to some one after I used it for a couple of years great boost,positive
I dont own the SRH840s but rather the SRH440s It was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the 440s in terms of sound and comfort I didnt believe the sound part but I bought them because I at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my 440s When I got them they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals They are definitely more comfortable I dont know what it is but something about the sound is different and I dont think its placebo There seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places I wouldnt expect I highly recommend this upgrade Great upgrade for SRH440,positive
This guy is great if you want to mount it on your guitar without a big clipon gizmo that people see easily Downside is that it is so small its hard to tell what button you are pushing and its not terribly easy to turn off and on Do I push again Push and hold Also the screen to read if you are in tune is so small that sometimes judging how close you are to being in tune is hard This being said its a nice tuner and stays on Also I should point out that while it does clip on its not as easy to move from one instrument to the other as some other tuners Really small but a bit challenging to use,neutral
To be honest Im not metal guitarist but I do love metal music and as far as playing goes I love bluesy solos with lots of distortion I decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix one of the best names in the business And for the fact it was cheaper than most Im VERY pleased with the pedal and couldnt be happier Great,positive
Always looking for reasonable pricing The picks were as good as advertised online it met our expectations and pricing was good Good deal,positive
I wear a large sized glove so assuming that would translate I got these While I can force it over my thumb it is very tight and uncomfortable ie pinches My thumbs dont have a particularly excessive diameter either Im gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit I know they need to be snug so the pick doesnt rotate when being used but this is ridiculous Three stars because if they fit you it is a nice pick it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing Large just aint LARGE,neutral
I have enjoyed my Protec Strap I was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and I have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my Dot Studio One note would be that these straps are probably better for your lighter body styles strats teles sgs heavier guitars will tend to start digging into your shoulder after an hour or so Having the pick pocket is a neat feature I am just finishing up rebuilding a LP copy and I will be getting another for this guitar net week Great strap for the money,positive
Since I bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want themI use to misplace my picks all the time when playing and now I do not have to look around for them any longer as I know where to find them I like to use different gage picks therefore I have ordered more for Christmas stocking stuffers whicdh will be enjoyed by my friends A great gadget add on to my guitars,positive
Pretty decent sound and its not too small for an adult to play but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm jazzy tones you can get Still very satisfied Does good makes you wish for another humbucker,positive
Solid tuner more accurate than I anticipated and very easy to use It will get you extremely close and for the size and functionality it seems to be the best product of its kind that Ive used Snark SN1 Tuner,positive
Firstly let me address the 34adjustable backrest34 Theres nothing adjustable about the backrest The seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesnt move the seat does It also does not adjust up and down as you would think an 34adjustable34 backrest should The backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this But the seat does adjust slightly forward and back presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem The footrest however is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest youre again limited to where you can put the seat in height rangeAll this aside I am still giving the stool high marks because its a fair price it does fold down with some extra disassembly for transport to venues and I find it works well for me But for how it works for me you should know I wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap I found that no matter how I adjusted the stool that I was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so I use it now exclusively with a strap In this way however its actually really nice because I can use the footrest or not at will and I can also stand up walk around and then sit back down at will Without the strap though my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor at least in my minds eyeIf you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool You do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest Then youre left with several pieces to schlep Not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every dayOverall though I am very happy with the way this stool feels No more couch and kitchen chairs for me May take some getting used to and not as adjustable as it may seem in the description but a good comfortable stool,positive
I was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what I got There isnt too much to say about it Its sturdy Its adjustable Its a great price It really made playing easier for me Just what I was looking for,positive
When I first learned guitar my buddies kept telling me Id want a capo but I held out until just recently The Dunlop is secure doesnt scratch the guitar at all and holds the strings down as it should Instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning I can use this to achieve the tone I want Good item for the price Good Item,positive
I bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust ButSometimes I play guitar in a band where I mix from the stage and the vocalist likes a little slappy echo on his voice but between songs he likes the delay off so I figured an experiment was in orderI ran 2 20 cables one from the aux out on my board to the delay input the other from the delay output to an open channel on my board I turned the level to max and dialed the really wet signal into the monitors and FOH I let him kick that pedal on and off all night now I can concentrate on playing and not on whether I forgot to muteunmute his stupid delay Win And it sounds pretty darned good I shaved a little treble off the channel so it didnt get too in the way almost like an analog quality Good stuff Vocal delay for real,positive
A bit invasive and awkward I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid These feel a bit weak These are okay,neutral
Needed something to allow the strap on the guitar to be removed for ease of operation during playing This filled the bill works on basically any type of guitar It just hooks around the neck and ties into the strap and has a quick release Guitar strap,positive
This is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to I like the size smaller than your regular picks and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar Good one,positive
I have one of these as well as several other microphones The SM58 is a good all around mic the reason its an industry standardgoto but the Beta 58A is a better in my opinion vocalspecific micbasically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound The SM58 by comparison sounds muffledmuddy where the Beta58A is clearer stronger and more articulate If youre used to the SM58 then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh but that is adjustable at the board end result is that its a tighter sounding mic with more clarityPatternwise it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds I play drums and use this mic for that reason is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58 Built like a hammer Better than some hammers actually,positive
These cables are a little thin compared to hosa and GLS They picked up a little interference from other equipment as well Guessing they are lacking some shielding Thin cables,neutral
COMPARISONS I have compared side by side the following pedalsFulltone mini deja vibe 200 Dunlop Univibe discontinued stainless steel model220 Dunlop Rotovibe 180 Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe 150 BBE Soul Bender 129 as well as comparing to some different beasts in the modulation family an MXR phase 90 MXR EVH flanger Boss chorus Behringer Vibrato and Behringer Time MachineSUMMARY just the factsA great pedal and my favorite univibe of all Doesnt take a lot of space up standard power supply good visibility on control knob settings Does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise This is the only pedal in the univibe group I can say that about and its why its almost certainly going to be the one I keep Might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others still need to play with it a little more Overall I LOVE this pedal at under 60 bucks Only downsides I see are the LED does not flash the speed rate and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to toe tweak with my right foot Quality seems ok but time will tell on durabilityPROS Smallish form factor although slightly larger than a boss pedal doesnt take much more room than a standard pedal Standard power supply 9v Center negative and jack on top back for easy access not in the way for patch cables on sides Switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato Controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking easy to see Best PRO is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass mids or lows It just applies the univibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone This is the only pedal I tested that I can say that about and most of the others cost 24 times what this one cost LED is red visible and NOT a weird bright laser to my retina The PRICE at about 60 bucks is a great deal Quality of construction metal case decent knobs pots and switches no complaints so farCONS LED does not flash speed rate Speed control would be better placed Top right or bottom right for toe tweaking I have just had this a day so cant tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound not sure about that and I will update this review as I get time to test further But it sounds great to meOVERALL highly recommended if you want a univibe and dont want to do a lot of comparison shopping I have done it for you Some users report quality issues here I guess time will tell on that Mine works fine so far and for 60 you could buy 2 and still save money over most other options availableNOTES ON OTHER PEDALS I COMPARED Fulltone Mini Deja vibe highest quality construction as expected at 200 The large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking very useful on a vibe pedal My complaint is that this vibe colors my tone it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass This probably helps the sound stand out in a mix however Id rather that my vibe not provide EQ because when I switch it on or off I dont want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back my sound I was able to match exactly an authentic original Univibe sound with some adjusting It seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also I have a lovehate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it Some days I hate itbut I like the build quality and the speed control I originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didnt strip the treble off my tone until I realized the mids were boosted the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked Mixed bag and at 200 shouldnt be MXRDunlop M68 new in 2014 At about 140 The new M68 UniVibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like It is second place on my list On pure sound I might even like it slightly better than the Jimi and thats saying something Its the perfect form factor shapesize with no significant coloration of the tone other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode The M68 gives the Jimi a good runand if you are extremely tight on board space it might be a better choice for you They sound very similar The M68 has a wider range of adjustment on speeddepth than the Jimi but Im not sure the extra range is useful MXRJim DunlopMXR have GREAT factory customer service if you ever have an issue They fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty I really do wish MXR would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface It is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other MXRs Use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as Id have to leave it with the mini switch engaged and the red LED burning all the time looking like it is on when I was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch It was also a tight fit This pedal has a level knob which Im usually a fan of but I dont see the need for it on this effect I didnt care for the white main LED much and of course the power supply location The LED on this does pulse the speed but was annoying due to the white LED Thats a subjective thing I suppose All said this is a great sounding option with that perfect MXR size so a good choice But still 2X the cost of the Jimi I stuck with the Jimi on form function sound and value Dunlop Univibe UV1 Cool stainless steel construction Knobs were hard to see settings placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best Non standard 18V power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick Sound was very good but did also color my EQ sound by boosting the bass and muffling the mids and highs slightly On the one hand this sound matched a lot of recorded univibe sounds Ive heard On the other hand once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix The seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days so I returned it and they lost the sale Othewise I would still be thinking about this one I was on the fence about whether it was my winner I was able to match a true univibe sample but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me At 220 Id have to love it to keep it Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe Liked the form factor the simple controls high visibility knobs ability to toe tweak controls standard 9V power supply and placement of all jacks Can get a very lush even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted and midshighs are cut The EQ effect just kills the pedal for me Its going back Not my pick at 150 BBE Soul Bender My least favorite Vibe It had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass In a band mix Im pretty sure it would get totally lost At home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple I think it pulsed the speed My recollection is it had an overly bright blue LED It was the first vibe I bought and I only compared to Fulltone and Dunlop before returning it Had some useable sounds but with the intensity above 50 had an annoying womp womp womp of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion With intensity below 50 it was usablekind of But a tone muffler I returned this one early Dunlop ROTOVibe A good choice perhaps the only choice if you MUST have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment Didnt color the tone much and that was a problem on most other univibes tested Limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me Intensity range seemed less than other pedals too Large footprint if mounted on board but also offers the ability to take NO space on the board by not mounting it I didnt like that when you switch the effect on you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design Some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in Std power supply a plus LED indicators good and flash the speed Durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots Overpriced 15 to 2X in my opinion Other general modulation effects Univibes are effectively a phase effect without the swooshy spaceage edge on the sound You can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined A modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceage sounding Vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a univibe and Id recommend the behringer vibrato at 25 if you like vibrato sounds univibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting Didnt care for the Behringer time machineMy

NOTE ON VENDOR SELECTIONI had a very bad experience with the vendor I bought my MXRDunlop M68 from and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product I provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page I recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal or anything else you be careful to avoid the Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet in San Jose CA In addition to charging a 15 restocking fee if you want to return the pedal in original condition with all materials and packaging getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with Amazon to get any meaningful response Once they did communicate they were very unprofessional Further when the product was shipped back signature required as recommended by amazon they were not available or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product it remains unrefunded despite their confirmation that I could return the item for an 85 refund I expect Ill need to work further with Amazon in the end to get this resolved A google earth view of their addressed explained it all MixDSPnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex Most Amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not at least when it comes to returns Also while they sell a few DunlopMXR guitar pedals looking at their site reveals its not their primary business they seem to sell a bunch of other nonmusical widgets My recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for 30 to 45 days as most large musical instrument retailers do should you need it They have a few hundred positive transactions so maybe can be OK but I can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction Ive ever had shopping on amazon a GREAT choice for a univibe pedal,positive
its a one dollar pice of plastic that holds your picks it has a spring in it that pushes them up like a dispenser in a way has sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your guitar or case so you always have picks what more could you really ask for,positive
This gauge is perfect for my 1970 Gibson J50 The phospherbronze alloy wrap brings out hidden tonal snap in this old rather heavilybraced guitar The may be too bright for a lighter instrument but they really shine on my old guitar Unbeatable for an older guitar,positive
Bought this as a backup to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much I dont think you can change the gain on the AT system My only nitpick is that Ill need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1834 For the price its amazing I just hope it works in the field as well Initial tests went well,positive
This is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place the mount screws were too low of quality to use though I went and got my own mount screws was able to use black ones that matched better as these did not work that well and I did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them Very good holder,neutral
I got an ernie ball strap instead of a planet waves strap Three Stars,neutral
this light is exactly what I needed very bright and great battery life AND it comes with power cord unlike some others where the cord is 10 more we are an acoustic duo and play out on a lot of decks at bars and restaurants and this is perfect lights the music book nicely a definite must have awesome light,positive
great product for the price I mean they are guitar picks and medium picks at that Nice gloss finish and the designs on them is pretty cool good product,positive
I know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here The unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a RODE M1 mic or similarI knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot but I opened one tried to use it and cant It was a total waste of money but doesnt pay to return it I suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it it might serve your purpose Again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands Too light weight for any decent mic,negative
I tend to drop picks from time to time and its nice to have them at the ready when the time arisesThis was a basket filler when I needed to get to 25 for my free shipping one day but I find it very useful and use it every time I playDont know why I waited so long to get one Love this,positive
Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets I thought Id try to get a little more sustain switching up strings At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash played on it for a half hour went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655 then retuned sounded pretty good Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now Dropped the action back down and its smooth as silk in an hours time VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND Was looking for sustain,positive
The mixer is good for the price but I had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside The packing way below average As a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing However the great seller I am referring to AMAZON immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit Second unit too had the similar packing but no damages Worked fine Good product but poor packing,negative
This is a great pedal very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board I also like the tone a lot Bear in mind I like the more vintage tones its not a crisp crystal clear tone like youd get with a digital delay its got more warmthTheres a great video on YT from proguitarshopcom that demos it very well Its got great short and long delay very smooth feel and the mod switch adds just the right amount of modulation to your tone to make it a tad fuller This is not a bright sounding delay it can be a tad dark at times if youre not carefulI use this for my long delay sounds and use another delay for short slap back and echo sounds its a Mooer micropedal They work well together too to get a huge fuller ambient type of sound going I put the Mooer before the MXR in my chain I use all my pedals right into the front of my amp as theres no effects loopI hope this helps your decision If you like warm old school tones youll dig this pedal Great pedal great tones,positive
These strings sound amazing They also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing I get better harmonics with these strings as well Great sounding and long lasting,positive
Im new to acoustic so Im not too sure how things go but from what I have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good A little to thick for my style though They make a very deep and loud noise I prefer placing electric strings on acoustic They sound much better and arent quite as loud Good strings,positive
Dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too longI got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds This beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice jobIt does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what its supposed to Also note that the cap on the machine doesnt seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too muchKeep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later Its best on a stand 34 feet off the groundOverall build quality is very nice Metal case compact nice bracket lighted remote telling you when its readyThe threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy Very nice for the size and price,positive
A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted Works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes Loud hum no matter what,negative
The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordableI did not realized it was double screened until it arrived so it was even better than I had expectedAs an added bonus one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy so for reminiscents sake I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording DIf you needed a pop filter this will work just as well as the expensive ones and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine didBuy this product Jake,positive
Great build quality works like it should Feels comfortable to wear also No complaints at all Great color also considering my guitar is a shade of green D Awesome strap for an electric guitar,positive
Good flexible cable The connectors are well fitted Fast delivery and a good price Ive bought an additional two since my initial purchase Well constructed cables at a good price,positive
We got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar As expected it doesnt have the sound quality of a fullsize instrument but it sounds good for what it is It seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it The blue color is pretty and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar case strap etc Other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap We did notice a scent but it didnt bother anyone A more odorsensitive person might feel differently good guitar for travel,positive
Got this tuner for my new bass clipped it onto the headstock was able to tune without plugging it into the amp clear bright display Might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars nice tuner,positive
Ernie Ball Acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life My playing sucks sounds better with these strings Bright and warm at the same time Great tone Easy on the fingers Ernia Balls acoustic strings are terrific,positive
Best straplocks I have ever had In almost 30 years of guitar playing I have tried many straplocks cheap expensive nickel steel gold youn name it I have tried it These are the best topping any other by far More secure than all competitors never wear out at all locking system never fails and these always maintain their fantastic looks and for a very long time I have them in Chrome in every guitar I own Highly recommended Cheers Best straplocks in the Market,positive
Works great keeps all my fretboards looking great Even though I change strings frequently on my twelve 12 acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever I play hard for several hours almost every day and Im always amazed at the 34crud34 that accumulates on the fretboards Guess Ill have to stop eating Cheetos while Im playing just kidding This oil breaks down the 34crud34 and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition No issues no problems only positive things to say about the oil Works Great,positive
I use to use a cloth to clean my strings this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful toolEasy to open clamp on the strings run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer The only thing that I worry about is running the plastic over the frets I understand that its only plastic but I wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over timeI dont know if I see an issue I may update this a year or so down the lineUntil then Excellent solution Almost perfect,positive
I bought this Snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele Ive been using a blue Snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it I thought she needed a Snark of her own and it works like a charm I like the chromatic aspect of it because you can tune your strings to any pitch other than concert pitch Sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or halfstep higherIts beautiful to look at clips on the head of the instrument with soft rubber feet and truly does an excellent job of tuning I teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one I go to the most and I have a lot of different tuners I rarely use any of my other tuners anymore relying mostly on the Snarks that I have It uses a CR2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time I use my Snark at least 4 times a day either tuning my instruments or my students What I really love about these types of tuners is that you can talk while tuning since it feels the vibrations of the string instead of listening to it It will tune practically anywhere loud rooms etcand tune accurately Snark SN2 All Instrument ClipOn Chromatic Tuner,positive
You can mess around swapping parts pickups and capacitors But the biggest change Ive experienced is with the tone block change The Mexi Tremolo bolted right in to all my Strats and even my MIK Squier It went from thin and tinny to being a real tone monster with superb sustain The combination of the mass of the tone block and flat steel saddles has given me the exact sound i was looking for Couldnt be happier Strat Mexican Tremolo Upgrade,positive
Ive been in professional broadcast studios that dont have mics as nice as this one Good flat response but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you dont like to EQ after the fact Sounds like a million bucks Quality studio mic,positive
I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo This unit is perfect for small projects,positive
Yep I said it BETTER than a TubescreamerThis pedal has a wider gain range far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid 80s screamerThe only thing it seems to lack is the 34smooth creaminess34 of an old 808 but I can easily live with thatThis is an amazing TS clone and for the price cant be beat Better than a Tubescreamer for 14 the price,positive
Outside of a vintage Show Bud volume pedal this is possibly the finest volume pedal on the market todayVery smooth and accurate I like the feel of this unit and the sound is transparent I cannot tell if it is in or out of my signal pathI run this volume pedal AFTER my pedal board at this time I have a dirty pedal delay chorus and tuner on the board at this time But I am upgrading to a larger pedal board soon and will place the volume after the dirty pedals and before the delay and chorus pedals at that timeThe pedal is heavy sturdy thick rubber pad on top nice rubber the bottom that covers the entire underneath of the pedalBuilt like a tank brushed finish connections on the frontIt is very big I wear an 11 12 shoe and it fits my foot very well so this is not for a small pedal boardThere is a tension adjustment on this unit so the end user can dial the feel of the pedal in to his or her likingIf you need a volume pedal just buy this one you wont be sorryJust as a reference I have used an Ernie Ball the one with the string and the Morley volume pedal this Dunlop Volume pedal is finer than the other two the fit finish sound feel while using it ease of use and build quality far exceed any other pedal on the market today Finest Volume Pedal out there,positive
The Snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat Great tuner I got about three of them Accurate,positive
Very versatile tuner It automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away It also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them There are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy Great tuner,positive
I write and record my own music When I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8 it wouldnt support my MAudio Fast Track Pro so I had to upgrade The Focusrite Scarlett worked right out of the box I replaced the stock cable with a Monster cable and my recordings sound great Very easy to use Just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking Awesome audio interface,positive
I recently purchased a used American Fender Strat that came with the old tweed casenice case but doesnt provide the protection that I need for my guitars The FenderSKB case is built like a tank and provides great protection and it has TSA locks for when you travel A nobrainer for Fender guitars If you have a Fender Strat or Tele this is the case you need,positive
Used one of these when I forgot mine and loved it so much I had to get my own Small takes up only one spot on a power strip or outlet Long cord is great Enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslyTotally worth the buy Do it Best effect pedal power supply out there,positive
I was a little unsure when I was unpacking this stand as the actual rack swings side to side When I put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly This cradles my guitar nicely I just wish that it was like the one in the picture and was straight It actually reclines back fairly far Well father than it looks like it would in the pics I will recommend this to anybody in my life who ends up needing a guitar rack in the future Great Stand,positive
The most annoying thing about modern ideas in Ukulele strings or indeed in Guitar strings is to wind them with aluminum wire making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands or at worst cognitive damage skin contact with them These rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound but are silver plate wound no health problems possible from strings makes them the best At Last Decent Baritone Uke Strings,positive
Think of this as an artists tool And for every job there is the right tool Is this the best distortion pedal That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other geartechnique you are using with it If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 8185s But arguing over what pedal is best is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp if that makes any sense It it doesnt make sense there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai Joe Satriani and Kurt Cobain It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians Its built like a brick and durable as all getout I found mine used for 20 but the new asking price is fair I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use but admittedly I dont detect any tonesuck with it Ive run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads With the exception of modeler type pedals from companies like Tech 21 I do not think that any dirtboxes this included perform optimally when run into a solid state amp So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG the problem is in your amp Solid pedal for a moderate amount of tight sounding distortion,positive
First off Im NO ukulele expert That being said I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these I know they stated Concert however reading up on this they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings Like another reviewer said its not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke but it sure helped out a lot The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well Im loving the sound Also I really like the way they look on my pink uke its a nice touch I would definitely recommend these Bright sounding strings,positive
It doesnt seem to work I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesnt seem to absorb any water I dont get it,negative
I love this little deviceIm an amateur musician so Im on and off on playing I play enough I need to know theory but not so often I dont forget the specificsThis gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tabI dont believe this is a tool to teach people music theory but it is a wonderful reference once you know what youre looking forFor example Im playing with the harmonica now Simple little instrument right Well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major minor major pentatonic minor pentatonic and blues scales in 12 different keys One section of this wheel lists all of these different scales Rotate the dial to the key youre interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key youve selected appears NiceAlthough I play guitar I find the other side of the wheel less helpful Yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords MmmMMmDbut they are barre chords based upon the E chord If you understand the formation of an E barre chord and its family E Em E7 Esus Esus4 etc this may not be so helpful I really dont use E barre chords much beyond the 7 fret as I usually switch to the A type barre chord based off of the 5th string so my hand has much less distance to travel Ive not found anything to support these A type barre chords nor the others D G CI find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance Lots of Information in a Small Space,positive
Needed a boost with my headphones while playing Rocksmith Item works as advertised very easy to hook up I am using with xbox 360 and auvio wireless headphones 33283 out of production but still work great Works well,positive
A little large and not really light but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way Fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap Very well made although the bag is a little lower quality Sturdy enough to hold a big binder 300 page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable Goes up and down and tilts back No slippage Sturdy portable stand,positive
I had trouble with strings going out of tune too often Installed these Fender locking tuners and voila Amazing difference Restringing is much faster now and tuning is fast no long loops around the tuning pegs holds up much longer rarely need to retune now even after lots of bending and vibrato I love the Ernie Ball Super Slinky 942 strings and Fender stainless steel 942 strings alsoMy opinion is every Strat benefits from these tuners they should be standard on both the MIMs and American Strats Yes to these Nearly half price from Amazon,positive
Awesome instrument It stays in tune and is fun to play The best 29 that Ive spent in a long time After a week Im already playing songs and Im not a string player Dont purchase this without buying a tuner I bought the Snark SN6 Uku tuner Its awesome too Best 29 ever spent,positive
The Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable 5 feet is a very well pro made cable that has always been exactly what I needed Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable 5 feet,positive
This is by far my favorite pedal on my pedal board but you should know somethingi hate it at first because i had a solid state amp and this one sounded like crapsorry for the bad word then i got a tube amp and omg its like GOD in personI really really recomend this one My favorite pedal,positive
This capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open Im hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension it is all I can do to open and place this on the guitar I cannot do it with one hand Very stiff,neutral
Ive had this stand for about 5 years and have used it on stage for the last 3 years pretty steady The first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and I immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it Its plastic Plastic and cold dont mix The retainer piece broke and went flying and I was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig I managed to get it back together but now I have to be very careful when extending the neck The other part that Ive been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks It has come up completely off and I must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off I wont mark this stand less then 4 stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand Another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions which is very good advice Long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod Great Stand with a Couple of Weak Points,positive
Not quite as loaded as the red All Instrument Snark but it gets the job done Is very sensitive to vibration Good tuner,positive
This seems to be a nice rugged stand Much better than the one I received with a guitar I ordered It went together fast and is well padded It cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid Im not sure how much I will use it now I have discovered guitar wall hangers or string swings I prefer hanging them on the wall and not having them on the floor in the way just my preferenceI suppose these would be good for mic night or doing a gig but I dont expect that will ever be something I do unless I get a lot better than I am now I still suckbut Im having fun and trying very nice stand,positive
I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I shouldve known better than to buy My son who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacementI bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic the sound quality is excellentAn excellent value for the money Excellent quality exactly what I needed,positive
Theyre round and they fit over microphones Work well to stop pops and lisps Have been very happy with them What I expected,positive
The software itself soundinterface 45 starsThe installation and activation 2 starsPROS1 The drums included in EZ Drummer are the most realistic computer drums I have ever heard Im using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound2 All sounds are MIDI which means you can manipulate how you see fit I use EZ Drummer with MixCraft and have modified pretty much every beat I have used so far with the builtin MIDI editing capabilities3 The interface is clean an easy to use You just drag a beat from the EZ Drummer window into your DAWCONSWhen I was reading reviews I just thought the people complaining about the installactivation were being wusses I mean seriously how hard can it be Well they were right it sucks It took me two hours to get it all workingMy advice Dont even install the app from the included disc Instead just go create yourself an account at toontrackcom and download the most uptodate version and ALL the patches for the modules that come with itMy experience1 Try to install from disc Fails with a 13082 Googled the problem Found out I needed to get a toontrackcom account and download the installer from there3 Downloaded the 650 MB ZIPPED installer Then I had to unzip the 18000 files which took about 20 minutes on my PC4 I was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install5 Then I had to jump through one final hoop to active it take this key copy it here then copy this here stand on your head etcGreat software horrible installSlick Excellent sounding drums horrible installation,positive
I have used DAddario strings for years on my Gibson Les Paul and they sound GREAT Had a stint where I tried coated strings on the Paul but they just didnt have the ringing bright tone that DAddarios have Ive never been one to have strings break on me that often guess I just dont play that heavyhanded but I have many friends who do and who still use these and find them very reliable They are comparible in tone to Dean Markelys and Slinkys IMHO I very much recommend these strings to anyone who plays electric guitar of all styles I have used them on rock country jazz fusion and christian contemporary gigs Very dependable The set usually lasts me a couple of shows before I change them out like any string they will lose brightness after a couple of gigs Strings claiming to last longer than that in tone are in my opinion usually somewhat lifeless to begin with Anyway these are great threads for the ole geetar if you have never used them you should try them out good stuff The Workhorse of Strings,positive
It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell If you can wait a month for delivery or longer if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up If you have over a 500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too I have decided to build my own CHINA GARBAGE,negative
This thing is simple to set up and has a nice warm tone that I like for clean delays I also got the TC electronics nova repeater which has more options tap tempo and stereo out I use that one for distorted delays and dotted 8ths They are both great pedals that I use all the time Sweet sounding analog delay,positive
These are the best guitar strings I have used in over 50 years of playing the guitar Made in USA a very good price You can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings Best guitar strings,positive
I have been fortunate to build a small but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music All 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years Ive been using String Swings Ive never had a problem with them They hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style Since they swivel my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks The depth is adjustable so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars I didnt want to take a chance so I use selfadhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitars finish I try and screw them into studs to support the weight and where I cant do it I hang some of my lighter guitars but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screwin anchors but made out of metal just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens I also strongly recommend as others have done that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars 4050 humidity is perfect I recommend the HoneywellHoneywell HCM6009 QuietCare 9Gallon Output Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology String Swing Hangers work great,positive
These little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks I simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead And they produce no audible hum into the circuit They are unbalanced jacks though note the single black band at the end of the plug so if you need balanced jacks for your system those with two black bands make sure you take that into account before ordering By the way I have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording Just saying Solid adapters,positive
Nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right nowIt is a single strip of leather with no paddingMaybe it just needs to be broken inCompliments the color on my Lake Placid blue strat wellFor the record this strap is actually quite long even in the second strap holeI am about 59 and a trim 155 lbsAt the shortest setting I can manage the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when I am sittingUpdate 2011Jul31 The strap is still rather stiffI will probably pick up a white cotton strapThose fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion Nice strap at a good price,positive
Ernie Balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound Im so proud of my Balls Im very happy with my balls,positive
Ive been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable Clean no residue from repeated use and the glide across the strings is super nice I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and wouldnt leave home without it Used by professionals and for good reason,positive
This is a fine product Any guitar player has hands strong enough to use it Looks great on the guitar and works really well Recomended Excelent product,positive
The description says the color is gold Its not More of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for I think I would stick with the black color though Just an ok capo,neutral
I bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp I play guitar She has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome I was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for herUnfortunately it doesnt fit on top of our harp The tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp It does however clip into the sound hole okayIt tunes the harp fairly well I only had problems with the top 34 strings which I had to pluck a bit harder for the tuner to pick upI also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly Clipped it to the top of the headstockTracking is very very good for a tuner at this price I was able to play the strings tune them and watch the meter follow the note Display is very easy to read and lights up nicely I was tuning in a dimlit room and was able to read it perfectly Im sure it would be great on a dark stageThe only other drawback is that the display needs to be positioned within a certain range Otherwise it gets a big hard to read But positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily4 out 5 only because of size not fitting on harp as I hoped and display legibility depending on angle I had to reposition it maybe 2 times in order to tune the whole harp Easy to clip on Easy to use Smaller than expected,positive
If you have an acousticelectric uke this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends beach road trip camping etc Its quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag Its not a great electric amp but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke Use a 9volt when you need it or buy a 9v AC adapter to plug into an outlet You cant find a better option on a budget when fun and convenience is more important than audiophilequality sound Perfect Uke Travel Companion,positive

Ive been using one of these Kysers for a good while now I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo If you never used one its makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when Im playing chords when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on With a little practice youll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz One of the best mandolinbanjo capos out there,positive
Let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide the batterry that come with it lasts an average of 6 9 months A new battery will last over a year I get replacements at local CVS Savon store I keep buying more of these 12 guitars and 1 Bass I want one for each of them,positive
Its a great pick for a soft sound I wouldnt use it for aggressive work but for slow ballads its great Soft Sound,positive
Its hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does It works and its by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computerI use it with Audacity At first I found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss After fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out I thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product The next day I fooled around with it more and realized I needed to turn the mic input down in Audacity and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer When I did this it completely shut out the hiss Ive been making great recordings sinceIts a plug and play tool but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like I experienced However they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very wellFor those wondering about latency obviously theres some Youll get latency with any type of recording device You just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing programThe only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high It does not sound like that in the recordings though So its OK I can deal with itThis is a very good product and cant be beat for the price When it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly When you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic It would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it though Good Deal,positive
Sounds simply great As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume it changes its distortion the louder the more distorted The Pignose power supply Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100 is helpful when been home but also works with 6 AA batteries You can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higherwatt amp It comes with really nice looking stickers Im planning to keep it for yearsUpdate on reviewJan 9 2013I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps but as time goes by I just fall more in love with my Piggy Ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitarsI have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives I cannot get this crunch with the other amps no matter how much pedals bells whistles I have tried This crunch is unique and the world loves it as simple and plain as that The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love withThe 7 chords give a clean amazing sweetgrumble the one that make teenage girls sigh for you with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar Muddy Pig,positive
The Behringer UCG102 device is an aging yet affordable piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the USB port of a computer This opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones For the budget player it could be argued that a mere 32 investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilitiesHowever while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly there are some significant problems here First and foremost there is the problem of getting the device to work getting the software to recognize it and configuring it to run without significant latency which is a delay effect where you dont hear a played note immediately when its played which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible The UCG102 runs on an ASIO driver They include an older version with the software and you can snoop around online and find other options But that doesnt mean it will necessarily work with your software or work well if it does For example Audacity is a popular freeware program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer Ive been told that Audacity doesnt work with ASIO drivers and when I got it to record the latency issues rendered it unusableYou do receive two other software options with the device The first is energyXT2 which I believe includes a license for the compact version In theory this program should work like Audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects in addition to drum and bass track loops However I have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program Im sure it CAN work but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out thats really not ideal for a budget productThe second item is a trial disc with Guitar Combos by Native Instruments So far this has been the most impressive of the options offered You can demo three different amp simulators Vox Fender and Marshall and then enter a code to unlock one of the three I like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp which allows you to dial in some realistic tones Its also the only program Ive been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in there are problems with recognizing mono vs stereo I adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to 8 miliseconds which is just into the range where I dont notice it as a problem Still while the models sound good Im not sure how often I would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recordingShortly after ordering this device I discovered that my sound card has a blue line in audio jack on the back By running a simple 18 to 14 audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card I can do direct recording which is monitored through my computer speakers no latency and sounds great Even better this method works through Audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks If the UCG102 worked as advertised it would be a more convenient way of doing this but I simply cant recommend it for most people I feel like theres 4star potential somewhere in this device but I doubt Ill ever have the patience to unlock it 3 stars Functional device problematic software drivers,neutral
Ive used these picks for years with great results If youve never used this stile picks you wont be sorry If you need some good picks try these out,positive
This is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there It is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined I would recommend to get a few roles of powergrip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcros included in most pedal boards and a onemeter roll around 3 feet wont last long especially if you have a combination of both regular size MXR or Boss and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby Wah or a VOX Satchurator or TimeMachine Reverb or similar You probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals even rare ones so this would be great for you to keep them wellattached to your board and properly organized Maybe the tape could be made a bit wider perhaps 12 an inch more would be great It would actually increase a bit the sticking surface Still a great productconcept A must buy Best velcro out there,positive
They have good ends they do feel a little flimsy on the cord side of things They have good signal though and dont seem to alter the tone I have them all on my pedalboard now so time will tell if they hold up or not They are good patch cables for the money,positive
No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item Theres no instruction which is fine But in the product description it doesnt say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you cant use itI bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I cant because it doesnt come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 510 to get it plus shipping The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip But without it I felt cheated Does Not Include Mic Clip,negative
This is the second tuner I have bought like this I got it because I need a second tuner They are very good tuners and I highly recomend any tuners this company makes Intelli IMT500 Tuner,positive
This cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones The plugs are of excellent quality also The sound that transfers through this cable is REMARKABLY IMPROVED over my old cable I urge you to purchase if you are lookingyou wont be disappointed BTW I am a verified purchaser just cant say enough good about this cableIm really impressed What a cable,positive
One of the my favorite thigns about Strats is how easy they are to modifycustomize After about 10 years with my American Standard I was itching to change up the look so I changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers I didnt need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts I wanted seperately The back plate is a singleply mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories this will give you a matching back plate You can never go wrong with real Fender parts Nice vintage look,positive
This is a fantastic little recorder but not for 300 I bought mine used for 75 on a bass players forum in the classified section That was over 3 years ago It has recorded almost every show I play which is about 25 gigs a month plus a couple rehearsals I record for my own learning purposes and sometimes to make very rough demos some audio is better than no audio and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do The interface is not perfect and there is a little bit of a learning curve with the settings but if you use the Automatic Gain Control AGC setting the recording level is taken care of I use Audacity to amplify when necessary to normalize always and to edit from wav to mp3 Its pretty easy and I am no sound tech nor am I a studio engineerAnd if you goof and unplug it before powering it down no problem Just pull the SD card out insert in to your computer save the files on your computer as raw files by changing the extension but first make a copy of the original file so that if you make a mistake you have a backup and import the file into Audacity as a raw file From there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as mp3 files Awesome recorder,positive
Bought these for home karaoke and they work great I also have a weekend DJ business and these work well professionally Why spend more My DJ business includes up to 4 Shure wireless mics at around 500 a piece but these inexpensive Nadys seem just about as good in sound and performance very few dropouts if you stay within 30 feet of the receiver Ill probably start taking these on gigs since they are so affordable to replace if they break Great Mics at a Great Price,positive
I am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items Once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product It holds your guitar up Takes a minute to figure out,positive
I just received the case today the soonest delivery day on the estimation range a plus there Now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case Nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rimthreading and basic locks keys included are gold toned instead of silver toned pictured but that doesnt mean diddlysquat to me Plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck I am primarily a 5string banjo player but decided to casually play around with the mandolin and so I figured I had better get a hard case for possible longtime storage my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before I started getting serious with it and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces This case will definitely do the trick Excellent value Additional note there is a bit of extra play around the peghead I have an Rover mandolin I can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough some peg snapping may occur But again for simple storageprotection its a nonissue Great Case Great Price,positive
I like the sound of this pedal and the ability to get the right over drive sound I want Ive used it with my reissue 70s Fender Strat plugged into my 1968 vintage Marshal 50 watt head and a slanted 4 cab Love the sound I am also using this pedal with my Ibanez GB 10 arch top jazz guitar and I am amazed with how good of an over drive I can get Ive also owned a tube screamer but I like this one better DigiTech DBM Bad Monkey TubeOverdrive AnalogDistortion Pedal,positive
Quiet and durable Five Stars,positive
I installed these on a Fender Jazz bass with active electronics After stringing them up tuning I immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded I play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played They sounded great all up down the fret board Where I really noticed the difference was in recording Been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before Except for the songs with acoustic bass I will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before I installed these strings I dont play slap or pick bass so I cant say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended Fine strings,positive
This kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard Its got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance plenty of stuff,positive
I really wanted this to work but it doesnt Dont botherit doesnt mute the strings at all One star just for it getting here on time Glaesel Violin Mute,negative
The gooseneck holds its position well when adjusted into place in front of the microphone Also the clamp works well However the gooseneck initially made some snapping sounds when flexing it that now seems to be in the past generally perhaps its a tubing issueI have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone minor issue with pop filter,positive
Just got this in this week Looks nice and works as intended For 22 bucks cant really go wrong I use this with a Behringer C1 and have had no trouble getting it to fit Its a bit snug but I would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit Nice ShockmountPop filter for the price,positive
This is a pretty strong cable I wanted something I can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case Im sitting on the amp the angle does the job seams strong seams like it will last Good cable,positive
As is the case with all tools you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter Its extremely wellbuilt and performs its task very wellPros Extremely high quality metal Comfortable rubber grips Red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bagoftricks Effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringsCons Has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage the tool is springloaded to open While this may be a plus for some people I find it less than idealOverall this is an extremely wellmade tool for your guitar kit If youre a bassist that likes stainless steel strings youll appreciate how they cut like butter Very nice tool if a bit expensive,positive
Cable worked fine but the strain relief for the cable end came out when I took it out of the package You can even see it on the left in the picture that its crooked because theres barely anything holding it in so it provides no protection for the cable Signal seems fine so if youre not going to use it or move it around alot it works If youre going to be gigging with it Id get something with a real strain relief Cheap but built cheap,neutral
It is exactly as represented It does a fine job I have used it in recording live band practice sessions I would if necessary purchase this item again 3 pin male to 14 inmale adapter,positive
I waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it I didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understandingIt works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas12 16GB Sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time but the Tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip it sounds good natural and spaciasget itI paid 110 shipped for mine so look on Amazon or Ebay for purchasethe big music stores always mark up the prices very HIGHzzounds musicians friend sweetwater music 123 dont buy from themJim Waited before giving this review,positive
Installed these on my Schecter C1 Hellraiser I had very high hopes for these but as with any new overhyped technology they failed to impress me The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised If anything they feel worse than regular strings Last but not least they are bad for frets Just like stainless strings harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick I dont know about anyone else but I dont want to have my guitar refretted every 2 yearsFor the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear Another gimmick for guitars,negative
I bought these wanting to try the nylon Big Stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead I wanted to mention this because the item description is vaguePLYS PK and the item pictured is nylon Im still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the Jazz Stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip Lexan Stubby not the Nylon ones,positive
Dont know why I didnt buy this years ago I had a metal slide for years but always like a glass slide sound tone more I like Dunlop products they are always good quality Price with Amazon Prime is a good buy Slip sliding away,positive
They cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable I have to take my glasses off when I use them but other than that exactly what I thought theyd be when I ordered them good for the price,positive
The one that shipped was the cheaper shiny plastic one In my experience this model is inferior Also the rubber lining inside the clip was unattached probably the glue didnt hold I like Snarks and think they are some of the best clipon tuners Just not a fan of the cheap shiny plastic versions Ill try returning it and getting the SN8 Not the best Snark,neutral
The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that Ive noticed its response is a little less than the original bulky Snark SN1 I must admit I havent checked out a new battery as with my original Snark a new battery made a big difference But the size is something that cannot be beat the original Snark is a little ungainly and this tuner really fits beautifully on my Strat I have a Boss Tu2 stompbox tuner and am thinking of freeing up my pedal board real estate and using this insteadOverall this is a definite buy Too cool,positive
These strings arent anything fancy but they sound great A good old standard that Ive used since I was a kid And this is the best price Ive found Good price good sound,positive
Snark tuners are great They are very accurate and are very inexpensive I have now four of them so I can keep one in each guitar case and one for the uke Great tuner cant beat the price,positive
I am both a bass player and a fidelity freak always fussing over tone settings This tiny amp packs BIG sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard and even my bass The CD input has NO controls but is a very useful feature just the same Having Behringer mics and a UB802 mixer I banked on this being a good amp and was NOT disappointed The 3band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument No 15watt amp will compete with live drums OR outdoor settings and do NOT expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds this amp will impress you Every musician should have one of these around Money well spent Best Quality for the Money,positive
Let me start off saying that you cannot go wrong buying any of the series of Mighty Bright music stand lamps The Orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product It provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design And the carrying case makes it very portable Fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp I have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal baseso I used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp toworks great The unit uses three AA batteries I started off using 3 batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours I prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord I am an older person who has old eyes Sometimes lower C and lower A look alike Mighty Bright Orchestra Light to the rescue The clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe however the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on topSome comments have indicated that when plugging the AC adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected The unit I purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip To confirm this on your unit 1 DISCONNECT the AC adapter from the wall and from the light 2 load batteries into the clip and turn on the light finally 3 with the AC adapter STILL DISCONNECTED from the wall outlet plug the cable into the base The light should go out If it doesnt your unit is not isolating the batteries from the AC adapter and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the AC adapter is plugged in Mighty Bright To The Rescue,positive
The title says it all I got it for 16 free shipping with Amazon Prime which is cheaper than my local music store I keep it on the head of the guitar and it is easy to add move remove With the triggertype release it makes it one of the easiest quickchange capos Ive used It feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum And best of all it works Its cheap easy sturdy and works,positive
I got these for the build in Pop Screen However I found it can only be attached in one place This is ok if you are using a full boom that8217s facing the singer But if you are working in a tight space and the boom stand is to the side of the singer this presents difficulties It fits my MXL mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem Not so Universal,positive
These work just like you want them to But a new strap and put these on right away Its worth it Perfect,positive
This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work which is pretty cool You dont have to hold it or put it on your leg Also this is very accurate and gives only a slight range to be in tune It is a great product Great Tuner very convenient,positive
This makes sliding on the bass real smooth Its also nice for cleaning It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time And its super easy to apply Even though youre not a pro act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play Real smooth,positive
works well the glass is a much softer more subtle sound than metal it works on my pinky finger would have to have a much larger one for my ring finger and I dont have particularly large hands Just dont drop one of these on you tile floor they explore quite nicely that way I keep mine in a protective case when I am not using it its a slideworks fine,positive
My son needed a Capo expensive at music shop where he takes lessons At Amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price Great price,positive
This thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely Its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better I can play for 2 hours and my shoulders feel fine I feed the narrow end through 3 of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good Well made feels very strong Texture is very nice doesnt slip Overall a very good product Comfortable well made strap highly recommended,positive
havent used this one yet i got it to run to my pedal board for those stages where the backline is not easily accessible seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general a cable,positive
I bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since Awesome feel sound and price Just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that I do I know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my Strat One thing I notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others I have tried Thats nice Something great,positive
I love these cheap little pedalsI dont know if these would make a long tour with rough use but they will be good for small club use with a careful handlerGreat for around the house and rehearsalA little noisy but what do you expect at this price rightSo far very reliable after a few months of use I will take this out on a little club tour and post back with problems and reliability concerns and if there are any preventative measures to address beforehandOtherwise great product They look cool also like something out of the 60s Star Trek or something09272013I still use this pedal on my main pedal board it just sounds so goodSound guy asked me about it the other night and when I showed it to him he didnt believe me10 for some of the best analog delay sounds out there who needs boutique pedals Great pedal for the price,positive
If your looking for the bestquality smallerpractice amp this is the amp for u its definitely high quality its got10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice ampdefinitely the best amp in thisprice range i woulddefinitelyrecommend it perfect practice amp,positive
I like these little guys Im not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price Great Alternative to Strap Locks,positive
It does what a guitar tuner should doIt simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuningI do have an equally good tuner by monoprice thats about half price Better deal if you dont just buy one and have to pay single shipping Cheap and It Works,positive
This is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use I dont have any problem with this stand at allAnd all of those people who have problems with the arms that move when you touch them that is part of the design It should not be a problem to you or your guitarThanks Austin Garcia On Stage Guitar Stand,positive
Works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations When the Z108 Party patrol is out and about the never leave without it Can beat it for the price,positive
I use it as a practice mic Its fine if no one hears you But if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm58 But if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine Shure its cheap,positive
Good product at a good price Have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker Great to have when friends come over to jam Works well,positive
this case is the best ive ever hadvery plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strongthe handle extreamly soft to the touchi guess all my other cases just dont measure up to this oneit even locksif your guitar fitsbut this for the quality best home for my new guitar,positive
We bought this stand for our sons new guitar amp Mic and it works fine for his setup It comes with the Mic clip to hold the Mic as well The height adjustments seem to work flawlessly Good Mic Stand at a Great Value,positive
Well worth the bucks i paid Analog with true bypass Easy to use with one knob And has nice high quality chorus effect MXR built like a tank Works with my Boss DS1 AC adapter too Great Deal,positive
this is the one that everyone told me I should use being new to guitar I figured one polish car has to work well that was very incorrect on my part this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes guitar polish,positive
Polishes well You could probably buy a microfiber cloth from somewhere else and it would do the same thing but this one works well Polishes,positive
For the price this box works just as well as as any expensive one would Just put in a 9v battery and it works right away Three knobs to control tone level and distortion to get that perfect sound I do recommend you get a power adapter because this eats us batteries like crazy I accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry batteries are expensive get the power supply Overall this is a good budget buy you wont need to money for quality with this Little box big sound,positive
These strings are so soft to the touch that they almost feel like flatwound acoustic guitar strings When you uncoil them out of the wrapper they dont spring out like most other strings but sort of flop out like a string string instead of a wire wrapped in wire They sound wonderful but I swear the feel easier to play and I was doing things with them I usually am pretty clumsy at with my mitts They wont last as long as coateds of course but they have a depth and a character all their own worth checking out and you may find like me that its worth going back to changing them out every few weeks to get the fresh sound If youre really an acoustic guitar aficionado youll want to try these The almost play themselves IMO And that makes me want to play twice as long Love themspecial niche,positive
Fantastic stuffI sprayed it in my bass guitars pot and now its like new Wish I had found this stuff sooner Scratchy bass guitar pot scratchy no more,positive
Nice F logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat Installed easy and the screws and everything were correct I would recommend this Good upgrade,positive
Make sure you get a Diago power supply or one that can deliver more than 500MA the one sent from Line6 is only 250MA huge error from L6 Great Product,positive
The absolute best strings money can buy for a uke Installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they wont do magic Good luck industry benchmark,positive
Decent strings I used for a beat up strat that I had Nothing to special but it was good enough for that Id recommend these Good for the price,positive
This is great for adding pedals You cant go wrong for this item with the price even more so thank you This a good cable,positive
I was displeased with a somewhat poorquality strap I was using before It just didnt seem to want to hang on so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacementThis is what I chose and notably I chose it for the color just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitarSo far its given me no problems and it looks very nice and functions perfectly This is a great bargain too since its certainly not an expensive accessory Great,positive
I have played guitar for most of 40 years and have used about any type of plectrum made I have used coins and washers at timesMy favorite pick for years was a Fender heavy and then I went for the really heavy brands like Dunlop or Clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone I went back to Fenders and then found I like the medium bestFender makes these in the coolest colors now so I went with them Price them at a store and you will come back hereThese came from GODPS which is no big deal as I shop on AMZ enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the timeHowever I ordered a lot of stuff the day I ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house 5 days later These didnt show up so I contacted AMZ which goes back to GODPS it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks It didnt kill me not to have them I have a million picks I just wanted to see these in my handThat said I will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colorsGreat price great picks Fender medium standard picks,positive
Was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal especially a delay for this price But I figured how can you go wrongif its not good at least youre not out a lot of money Ive been thoroughly impressed with this pedal Much more sturdy than it appears in photos I actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it Works great so far and dont regret purchasingworth every dimewhere else can you get a greatfunctioning delay pedal for this price Cant beat this for the money,positive
This pedal works like a charm Stays in place and works as described I would buy this again if I needed to replace it Great pedal,positive
I wasnt expecting much for the price but have to admit Im very pleased with the tone these strings produce straight out of the package After several hours of play and 2 tunings theyre spot on and sound sweet as cream butter Great product and very highly recommend Exceptional tone,positive
I received my cables very fast The xlr male the xlr Female are well builtNo humm so that is a plusThank You great cables,positive
The velcro itself is insanely amazing Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men then by all means use this stuff In the end you just cant make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board Once together it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably I cannot think of a practical application for this velcro The velcro that is so strong that you cant even use it,negative
It works as advertised but be aware its not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish It will mess up the finish Nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my Gibson Les Paul for example Its amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish thats a pretty major design flaw But they just keep making themAnyway it is a nice little stand but be careful If you have a nice guitar youll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage It works and the price is right but,neutral
These Fender Medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well Color and appearance is a personal thing I think these abalone picks just look cool The color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them Overall the effect is not bad compared to real abaloneFender makes a nice standard pick The three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy These mediums work well for playing electric guitar I have some light red ones that have a lot of flex Those work well for acoustic Ive used Dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the Dava rubber coated picks They are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick The gray Dunlops dont look anywhere near as cool as theseAt 3 for a dozen theyre worth a try It they dont work out for playing they sure look darn nice the Fender logo is in goldDava 6024 Grip TipDunlop Nylon Standard Picks Grey 73mm Very Nice Picks,positive
Its much better than what I got with my violin Its been good I cant really complain considering its basically tree sap Rosin,positive
Even though I have a tuner in my pedalboard setup and one on my iMac via MainStage 3 the Snark is indispensable Its perfect for those times when you dont want to drag out a bunch of gear and just want to noodle around even without an amp I use this little guy for electric guitars and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag Great Little OnTheGo Tuner,positive
Yes this ie every bit as good as the Shure SM 58 but you dont get the cool pouch The 57 version is also like its Shure counterpart Great sound and great deal yes I am a musician too Its an SM 58 for 15th the price,positive
If you need a tube screamer You cant go wrong with the TS9 The only reason why you shouldnt get it is if it isnt the right tone for you I say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal It sounds amazing It just might not be your sound I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9 People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording They prefer it Its not better Both are great Tone is subjective,positive
At first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my Epiphone LP100 Les Paul Electric Guitar Love it,positive
I bought them at 45 dollars Use for small music gigs and DJMC uses They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice isnt so important as long as you can be heard and understood I recommend for use of 1 Small music venues smaller bands Djing public speaking band practicesrehearses etcFor higher quality microphones at a reasonable price look at the Audix OM2 when its around 80 bucks or Audio Technica products Buy them at 3999,positive
Extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this The display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark You can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument The price couldnt be better I just cant believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists Snark Tuner,positive
I bought this cause i needed something to easily change the strings on my guitars This thing works great For the price you cant beat it Maybe one day I might get the powered one but until then this thing will do Fits in your pocket gig bag etc So you can have this thing on the go Works great and you cant beat the price Dunlop Stringwinder,positive
I have mine attached to one of the support arms on myOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Stand While this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports I was unable to use it with anOn Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Standeven with the top tier removed The reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboardWhen attached to theOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Standwith anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom Blackattached to the top screwin post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment barboom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard I use aRoland RD300NX Digital Stage Pianoor aRoland Vcombo 76 Key Stage KeyboardBottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most Xstyle stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted The total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 75 If your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional 3 with aShure A26X 3 Mic Mount Extension Tube Simple and effective,positive
I use it with home recording and it is great for my needs I recommend this to anyone who records at home Great,positive
I bought this to put the new strings on my guitar but the shipping info said it wouldnt be here for a few more days I restrung my guitar without it and it showed up in the mail a few hours later I can say its built much better than I thought it would be Feels like its built to last Yeah um,positive
Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze The EXPs are nice strings They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise And they last My two acoustic guitars a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars I figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze Only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer I prefer the warmer tone And since my guitars have alot of boom already i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast I imagine these strings may work in some instances but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars 8020 Bronze Strings,neutral
My pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as I can remember Id guess they have about 100 years of wear on themI used to be able to deal with it Violin teachers and techs I knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem More recently I tried adding fine tuners on G D and A to make it easier to tune but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much I figured Id give the drops a try The change was immediate I was able to work with the pegs more easily and slippage went away immediately I decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings When I did I also removed three fine tuners and still had the control I neededAfter changing one string things worked well but then I had the peg slip suddenly I figured Id try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault but it ended up slipping loose again I tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem After that I had no more slippage but I now have one peg that is bindingThe instructions are clear but minimal and open ended I dont expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect what symptoms indicate and so forth I tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard backSuffice to say the drops made an incredible difference but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure Id definitely recommend them but I hope to get some comments from users with more experience so I can have a better idea what makes people know its time to reapply and what they experience when they do itThe advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic not metal core strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners The effort I had without the drops made me avoid playing and I was using a Yamaha SV120 most of the time That can be fun but I didnt realize how much I missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune Not quite a miracle but impressive,positive
I have had 2 of these tuners youd think Id learn after one They calibrate okay its just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device both of mine broke this way To me for the price its made cheaply Try DAddario instead love their tuners Dont like,negative
This little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off It works without it but things things like that putt me nuts Great Tuner,positive
I already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw I like that one more and overall quality seems better on it even though pricing was similar when I bought the first one And the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they dont line up just right But when I put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay and thats the important part Not Bad,positive
Its obviously modeling the boss super chorus but still sounds almost as good just not as clear Four Stars,positive
Construction and Use 55The connectors and shielding on these cables are good and do not introduce much noise into a systemThe manufacturer has done a good job on this cable but the user is responsible for two things this addresses complaints I see in other reviews1 Take care of your cables The right angle plug side is much stronger than the straight plug side this is by design Take good care of your cables and it should last you quite a long time This includes taking the time to store them for use2 Make sure you know what length you need for a cable The shorter the cable the better for studio use It reduces signal travel time and potential for interference though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot If you need a longer cable buy a longer cable Dont buy what is advertised as 5 cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15 cable Great lownoise cable,positive
Assembled the stand in seconds It is very stable and solidly constructed Should last a lifetime Very very good value Very well constructed,positive
This tuner is cool It picks up even the lightest vibrations ie I can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out I also like the capo tuning feature You put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x I highly recommend this tuner Nice Tuner,positive
I have two delay pedals both inexpensive this one and a Behringer and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer the Danelectro sounds more natural The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal which is perfectly ok for some applications The Danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet youre not going to break it The only thing I dont like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the retro look of this pedal Ok fine Ive heard pedals costing twice as much that dont sound as nice as this one As one reviewer once wrote there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board I however think some of these cheap pedals function quite well and in some cases just as well as their more expensive counterparts If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail OCD and other boutique pedals I promise the other ones wont catch AIDS from this In fact the whole ensemble will benefit Great for the price heck great for twice the price,positive
This is a very nice guitar the finish and construction is high quality The hardware is what you would expect from a Yamaha product I really cant think of anything negative to say about it It did not come with a strap button sO I had to install my own but that is true with just about every acoustic guitar Very nice guitar,positive
The only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy Also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning Not bad,positive
A great little tuner Very accurate easy to use and the batteries last the better part of a year I bought 3 or 4 of these and I put in my gig bags or cases At these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments Buy them by the dozen,positive
The ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear Its built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time Ive had it Since I normally power it with a wall wart I dont have much of an opinion about battery lifeBottom Line It costs a bit more than the standard Dunlop wah pedals its worth it GREAT Wah,positive
Ive had this for about 11 years now Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market this pedal still sells well Not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound Theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which Im happy withIve always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors For most metalhard rock music the gain range is enough for me If I need yet more gain I punch it up with an overdrive or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost Even without a boost I can use it for death metal I think if you play the tighter more technical styles its better not to have too much gain anyhow Still the best,positive
I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted Inexpensive and worth it Nice Stylish Looking Screws for Rack Cabinets,positive
If your goal is to use these for mixing then just hit the buy buttonI have about 6 sets of various headphones from low end to nice gamer phones and these will allow you to hear sounds that your other phones will notI use these to mix down multitrack audio and then compare the final mix with a set of regular monitors I Can hear things with these that I cant with others,positive
Good quality and very comfortable for the material and with of belt no matter how heavy your axe is Cant go wrong with this one Good Strap,positive
Easy to use capo Good strength holds the strings down well Not sure that its as good as the G7th capo which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job Kyser capo,positive
I thought I was using good guitar cables but I kept getting intermittence with oneSo I tried this Monster cable It eliminated the problemMy only minor complaint is that it is very stiff This is minor but no matter what I do it curls up unless you have it fully extendedI would still recommend it though Heavy Duty Cable,positive
This should be your first pedal For 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion No other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck Its clean High Fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife This should be your first pedal,positive
This tuner is tiny and accurate Initially the instructions were somewhat puzzling to me because there were no diagrams next to the instructions For example the instructions read Press the tuners release lever to open the tuners ratchet clamp Uh ok I had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked After I figured it out Id have to say that I dont like this mechanism I prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp But I do like the rotation of the display As for tuning I had difficulty tuning the low E string on my travelsized guitar As a previous reviewer mentioned the display jumps around a lot even with the tip of plucking the string with a light to moderate stroke For my fullsized guitar the tuning was easier but I had some difficulty on the low E string Tuning my concert ukulele was relatively easy except for tuning the E string again proved to be more effort Just for fun I tuned a fullsized cello with great results but there was no easy way to clamp the tuner on Another experiment I ran was checking out the tuner in a room with another instrument playing After tuning the instruments I checked the tuning against another tuner and the mini tuner was spot on Although concealing the tuner from my audience isnt a concern of mine I would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern Otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me Tiny Accurate,positive
it worksBut expect some flawsFirstfinding a driver to use was a painIt doesnt come with a software discso look on Behringers support site for driver downloadWhatever driver you do use it kills all other audioyou cant run any other media player and get soundMy advice is unless you have a dedicated PC or laptop for using thisget something else for what it is,negative
What my headline says It does exactly what its supposed to do Removes those annoying popping Ps out of your recordings Until you can afford a Sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than youre going to need this And the price was right too Does Exactly What Its Supposed To Do,positive
I use several Behringer components in my setup eg my mixer PA Speakers effects accessories etc including this pedal I have confidence in the Behringer name and always feel like Im getting a good solid piece of equipment that I can rely on This pedal is no exception its a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal I dont like to depend on battery power for any critical components if I dont have to so I also purchased the Behringer PSUSB Power Supply General Purpose DC 9V Power Adaptor available on Amazon along with this Great price sturdily built great compressor effect I Love Behringer Use Several Behringer Components in my SetUp,positive
Guitar pics what more can I say Nice feel and look Never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft nice,positive
Great product with a little soldering knowledge really basic in fact you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all Nice and snug with my American Stage Cables DAddario is great Hey R Ford uses them Great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these Plug it in and rock out,positive
Ive used this on Guitars acoustic and electric Ukuleles Banjos Banjo Ukeleles Violins and mandolins no issues well except that sometimes it rattles quietly it doesnt effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar That Just means i take it off most of the time after i tune Thats not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the Tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time and I hate how that looks anyway I love the little thing My only complaint is that like all other clip on tuners that ive had it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally and will then wear out the battery cheap easy efficient,positive
My first amp with EL84s is a totally scratch built older single channel Trinity AC15 which is based on a Lightning Initially installed JJ EL84s after reading so many good reviews about them They sound great to me personal opinion of course and are priced right Thought about New Sensor Mullard RIs or Sovtek EL84M7189s Glad I went with the JJs and not looking back Im running 365VDC on the plates and 340VDC on the screens First set one red plated slightly Bought a second set from Dougs Tubes Ruby EL84CZs select matched JJs Performing nicely with a stock MIM Strat Also using a Sovtek 12AX7LPS in the PI spot and a postPI master volume just like Matchless EL84s in a Lightning clone,positive
Does what it says with no whining whatsoever really quiet producing absolutely no audible hum Very small footprint too Would I recommend it Yes I would Great Little Power Supply For the Money,positive
Its cleaned and polished pretty my Taylor guitar pretty well I would recommend this If not this one at least buy some kind of cleanerpolish Protect your investment It seems to work well,positive
I bought this guitar humidifier for my TaylorI received exactly what I purchased and works as it shouldThis product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around meIt is a simple design that fits perfectly between the stringsEasy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic containerPrice is good Essential for any guitar player,positive
I selected this to replace the cheap plastic Saddle that came on my Fender acoustic This was a tremendous upgrade and made a difference in the tone and brightness of the sound This was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions Valuable Upgrade,positive
Every guitar Ive ever cared about has had this strap on it I mustve bought about 10 of these over my lifetime and I dont regret it even in the slightest Proud to say I have one on each of my 8 guitars,positive
My Instant Order Update notice shows that I purchased this in December 3 2010 and during the time Ive owned this cable it has been heavily used and is still noisefree and perfect in all respects For context I purchased it to connect a mic tube preamp to a mixer so it has been set up and torn down many times in the past two and a half yearsKey points that earn the five stars is the heavy duty strain reliefs which keep the inside conductors from bending and stressing I am guessing those are why this patch continues to be noise free and provide a strong signal Also the XLR connectors are of the highest quality In the past I have cut corners only to find that small details like connectors do not always mate well Not so with these They engage and disengage without binding or looseness Bear in mind that they have been in frequent use inserted and removed hundreds of timesThe outer jacket is fairly thick which to me is an indication that the manufacturer did not cut corners when this cable was constructedOverall I am pleased because this patch has withstood a lot of use and has held up perfectly I would not hesitate to purchase more of this brand and model if I need additional ones Perfect patch cable,positive
Compressionsustain wise this unit is decent but I cannot abide the noise I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor Noisey,negative
thing is great for multipedal use This is a must if you have any of the DanelectroFAB pedals As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9volts like candy you purchase the power supply search for Danelectro DA1 96V AC Adapter and this cable and youre good to go for up to 5 pedals No more battery swaps This,positive
Yes ever so slightly Does it give you more sustain None that I can really tell People have been debating whether a steel brass or pot metal block makes a difference in tone and sustain I think the main difference is the actual weight or mass This is what is giving the deeper sound The strings go over the bridge pieces and so I dont think material matters for the block much if at all I think it is about the actual mass People who will say it makes a big difference are suffering from the placebo effect Without debate this will add weight to your guitar I think for the price it is worth upgrading the thin old style Mexican blocks This is pot metal as well which again is fine The rest of the assembly is well made as well and seems just like the stock bridge you would find on a stock MIM strat If you are thinking of going GFS blocks this is cheaper and will fit perfectly without you having the problems of not having holes line up etc which is a common complaint and indicative of GFSs crummy products in general I used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another Does It Improve Tone,positive
For the price they are awesome strings I like the soundI like a little heavier sound and Im hoping the high E will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge 34its always the first to go34 You cant beat the price on amazon I paid 950 at my music store but I needed strings ASAP I will order back ups at this price On Fender Squire,positive
This is a good item and has served me well However I just upgraded to an Intellitouch PT10 for a bit more money and its a much more convenient and really easy to use The Korg runs off of ambient sound and gets interference from background noise while the Intellitouch is a clip on and uses vibration to hear the note Good item,positive
Highly recommend this adapter because it is transformerless and has high current capacity for powering numerous guitar effect pedals It is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise Also it is designed so that it will plug into a power strip without covering adjacent receptacles Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product Visual Sound Visual Sound One Spot Adapter,positive
I play metal so I need a strong pick the Jazz III models and this one also has a texture Ultex that makes it easier to hold ontokeep it in the right position Second time I bought these one of my fav Jazz III guitar pics,positive
I have had them on my Loar Guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine We will see how long they last I have used Elixir for electric and while they do last longer I wish it was a bit longer Okay Guitar Strings,positive
These are amazing Im an intermediate player Have been for the last 30 years I tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip Every other pick I have used has turned in my fingersloose grip little sweat slick finish Ok nowthin med heavy You can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick Incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it And I can even hold onto it Very nice grip on these I have to keep getting more cuz everytime I hand one to someone to try its the last time I see it Just hit Add to cart You wont be sorry The Only Pick I Will Buy,positive
As with all Boss products Ive been very happy The tuner is easy to use need I say more Im from the olden days of the 440 tuning fork for tuning so this is GREAT Great tuner,positive
Nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great Also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun Lots of fun,positive
This is certainly a step up from the Hohner Piedmont Blues Harmonica Set that Amazon sells I have that one too I thought it was OK but I found that some of the harps dont work well and the gawdawful smell Actually it went away after awhile but in the beginning the plastic odor made me light headedAnywhoThis is a nicer set All harps work They feel substantial No smell Pay the extra money and get this setUPDATE The letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly A nusisance A step up,positive
i love this tuner so much the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back it works so well though and i knew id have to buy a second one since id never see the first one again great tuner,positive
Grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard Feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand but I guess thats how all of them are Works very well on acoustic guitars Good grip without any slippage,positive
DAddario guitar strings are favourite strings They last a little longer and always sound good on my Ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars I usually buy them for and recommend them to others also You can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often You will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned Top of the line Strings,positive
Guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic And Im sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient Even so DAddario has provided a consistent product for more years than Ill readily admit to knowing Ive used may other brands but I seem to always return to DAddario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars Strings is strings no not really,positive
I love this tuner It is accurate very reasonably priced I have ordered this tuner for fellow musician friends all of them love them Best clip on tuner I have ever purchased I love this tuner,positive
it hold my picks well but some are to big for it and the tapefoam on the bottom looses the stick quickly im neutral on this one its alright,neutral
I just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it They really help me out and they are a cheap price I couldnt do anything without this picks,positive
DAddario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around Ive used their strings for electric acoustic bass electric and acoustic guitar Irish bazouki mandolin Irish tenor banjo 5 string banjo even used their octave mandolin strings on my Serbian brach always with stellar results When they said these were deluxe premium strings I knew it wouldnt be hype I was right I strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio Ive never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3 45 minute sets but these did And I was sober so it wasnt just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune Not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when I played it Of course that wouldnt mean a thing if they didnt feel good on the fingers They do Like they were custom made for your guitar They were on my Rickenbacker so I cant honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but I strongly suspect they would Not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp new Im going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good I usually change my strings every other week when Im playing regularly so Im already passed my regular limit I may update this review in a month or so when I know how long they lasted Most highly recommended All they claim to be,positive
Great strings at a great price These strings have a nice sound to them and they arent the flimsy little strings you normally get for you guitar Nice sound for a nice price Good,positive
It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and wellmade However if you need to haul it around frequently it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat Also if you need to adjust the height you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other So not much selection there Comfy but Not Fast,neutral
I was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent I have a Seagull S6 Dreadnought and it fits in this bag like a glove The zippers are also very high quality and this bag will last a long time Another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor I had to travel in some very cold weather to a friends home and I fully expected to have to retune my guitar not so it was still in tune and the cold had no effect during transport due to the insulation of this bag High Quality Gig Bag,positive
To test I installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my 440s The 840 pad has a larger surface area see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots so I guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area But its really minimal and I did not notice a huge difference pressure wise The material is nicersofter than the original so that is a plus Every so often I would flip the headphones around to see if I could tell anything The larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it But seriously if you had me blindfolded I wouldnt bet my life that I always knew which side were which But in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up I cant imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of timeSound difference Yes one side in my test sounded better I felt until I switched them around Just like eyes your two ears are not 100 equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates I think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it I would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them Wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe Notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc It becomes highly subjective and I wouldnt buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims If you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive If you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but Im glad I didnt pay any more for them than I did from Amazon Thats my 2 cents Fine but a bit overhyped,positive
I ended up ordering this cable to connect a 535Q Wah into a Dyna Comp on my Pedaltrain 2 board Its the perfect length as the 12 foot cable was just a little bit too short Since then Ive ordered these patch cable in other lengths and theyve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard Perfect For A Pedalboard Setup,positive
Now I can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines 5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales A must have for guitar teachers IMHO Smaller than expected but works great,positive
What a great little gizmo I play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me No more unpluggingplugging inbetween songs Just a push on the pedal and Im switching noiselessly between guitars I can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well I love this thing,positive
No problem at allGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Thak you very much Good,positive
Great picks Nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your styleI would recommend these for any guitar player Planet Waves Assorted Pearl Cellulloid Guitar Picks 10 Pack Medium,positive
This thing is incredibly cool Double the record time of the closest competitor the TC Ditto and about twenty bucks cheaper Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes with unlimited overdubbing This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers likely due to preorder obligations and a delayed release It was worth the wait You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music Its a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing Operation is simple press once to record Press again and it begins playback Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer If you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub Tap twice to stop play of the loop Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing Switch is a soft switch so there is no click It is very responsive to pressure There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop Nicely done Digitech Way cool,positive
Some things just dont need to change Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz eq or other wacky addons but WHY Id rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal Its a must have and thats really all there is to say Its a classic for a reason,positive
These pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price Welldesigned and reliable I highly recommend these Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product Hosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable 6 Pack,positive
I recently bought these for my home studio so far so good keyboards to mixer They are a little flimsy but so far no problems have extras if necessary high end cables also break down They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus For the price and selection and results works for me 14 inch TRS color cables,positive
Real good variation from full out RAT like to not so much saturation The treble and bass control make HUGE sound differences Its plastic so dont jump on it The 1 2 I dont use the boost but its cool make it that much more versatile You wont be sorry Almost bought a Big Muff or another RAT but Im glad I spent WAY less money Bad arse,positive
Ive used more than a handful of USBFirewire interfaces over the past decade In the past its always been a crapshoot regardless of brand or reputation Instability incompatability and frustration abound with audio interfaces That being said this has been the best interface Ive ever ownedThe size is fantastic the preamps sound great it has phantom power it looks cool and most importantly its been rock solid ever since I installed it two and a half months agoI frequently leave my PC on 24 hours a day with this plugged in and as of yet I havent had a single crash dropout pop etc Its performed flawlessly since day oneRegarding sound quality my recordings have never sounded better Ive used this to record electric guitar straight into the unit acoustic guitar via condenser mics dynamic mics hammered dulcimer cello synth via direct input and it handles it all flawlessly Im seriously impressed with the qualityFinally its small enough to take with me when I want to record at a friends house on my laptopIve used it with Reaper Sonar X1 Guitar Rig 5 Cubase LE all without a hitch on two PCs Both Win 7 64bit The drivers gave me no hassle installing and as I said above ROCK SOLIDYour mileage may vary as I stated earlier audio interfaces can be quite the crap shoot Same setup same hardware etc and one person can have wildly differing results That being said I would definitely recommend this unit as it is my favorite of all time and Ive used everything from crappy firewire mixers to highend MOTU interfacesGreat for the price and if 2in2out works for you it should perform better than interfaces costing twice as much It performs better than my old MOTU 828 mkII that I got for five hundred Solid great preamps,positive
For the money this thing sounds just fine I got it for my son to toy around with He barely ever uses it but the times its been plugged in it puts out pretty good sound for the price Good little amp,positive
is a must if you have any of the DanelectroFAB pedals As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9volts like candy this is the solution You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter Search for Visual Sound One Spot MultiPlug 5 Cable and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals No more battery swaps no more searching for a 9volt every 5 minutes This,positive
I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1 This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events I own several of these and love themI highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional Also check out Hosas sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter Good adapter cable,positive
Like most products on the market depending on where and how the item is used your experience may vary For me this cable is going to be used on a semistationary mic stand in my project studio and thus far its done nothing but an exceptional job I tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario the signal was just as strong as the some of the other more pricey cables out there Would I purchase this again Absolutely Low Price for a Great Mic Cable,positive
These are pretty good quality tweed cables I prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs They also make one with the 90 degree 14 inch input as well Great Cables,positive
these strings sound really great and have that special nanoweb coating that is resistant to corrosion and rusting like other strings tend to get as they age the extra light gauge sound so bright and happy on my acoustic which is very old and tired looking but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it very much recommended acoustic and elixir electric strings as well best strings evaaah,positive
In my house I dont have to play quietly when rehearsing but when I really want to play along with a song and put some volume to it I can do it now without even a concern for our dogs the neighbors or my wife This device as the product description tells you allows you to plug it into your bass plug your earbuds or headphones into it set the volume and gain controls to suit and play away in complete quiet to the rest of the world In addition and this is the best part theres a 1834 jack on this device that allows you to plug an mp3 player into it so you can play along with music of your choice I rehearse often with this thing You might think negatively about this device considering the fact that you cant control all the tone parameters like you can when rehearsing through your bass amp Thats true But the big thing is being able to use it for what it was designed for and all the ways it makes rehearsing simpler less equipmentcomplicated and quiet when necessary lots of households have that need for quiet that dont always blend well with your rehearsal schedule etc I paid 50 for it and it works greatworth the money for certain I cant believe what a good thing this has become in my arsenal,positive
I use this often to record my bands gigs Now if they would make one that will hold a PAR 38 can so I can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks Great item,positive
Could be more tapered for such a tiny pick But the material is AWESOME Nice grip even more so when I sweat Great pick Nice sound Slightly better than the Jazz versions,positive
I live in a dry climate and I have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily Since I cant afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing I get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack The time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price On the refillable humidifiers you really cant forget more than a day or two to replenish the water With the humidpak you have a lot more security Going on a trip You wont have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case Works Like A Champ,positive
This is really a great amp for the price If youre new to electric guitar and you want an amp to get started buy this one It has incredible versatility and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different ampsI got much more than I expected for the price of this amp I really like the Bassman and Twin Reverb settingsI wont claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger better vintage tube etc but this will more than meet your needs to use at home Buy the 20W version which is plenty loud for home Later when you have the skills to justify it start buying some tube equipment This amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to playI considered various newused amps in the same price range and Im extremely happy I picked this one If you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me Id tell you to go away But if you stop by with a nice Twin Reverb Id give up my Mustang but then Id go buy another one Completely Blown Away By This Amp,positive
Nice design Small lightweight and very easy to use dose the job well I am thinking about getting a 2nd one Really great product Planet Waves NS Classical Guitar Capo,positive
I use these in my home studio as INSERTS and they work great No complaintsOn a side note I always clean all my cables with CAIG DeoxIT Gold G5 Spray Contact Conditioner 5 ozand hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce I also spray a qtip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments Good price vs value Works great for my home studio,positive
The tuner is great seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back doesnt hold it at an angle that i find very usable otherwise a fine product that i expect to last for years korg makes great tuners i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen id replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models good product good price,positive
Behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and I was skeptical about paying even bucks for an 8input mixer My intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox I wanted to use it for recording a drum set I wanted to do it through my MAudio ProFire 610 I had 4 mics 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set I love my ProFire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong I have no gripe with it its just that the preamp only works on two of the 6 inputs so I figure if I get a mixer I can use ITS preamped channels and run them through the 14 inputs on my interface Well it worked It worked GREAT Not only did it sound great but I was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic Low noise great sound and I still had 4 14 inputs on my mixer to play around with With my drum set experiment over I now had an 8 input mixer at my disposal Add two monitors and youve got yourself a nice little PA There are no BUS outputs so if youre serious about getting a descent mixer I wouldnt bother but as a starter mixer for the price offered I couldnt be happier It works fantastic for small gigs or God forbid house partiesIt may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple self explanatory and effective mixer I didnt need all the flash and the inputoutput jacks on the top is WAY better than running them out the back of the unit I hate that The EQ setup for each channel is basic Hi Mid Low FX Pan and Level Having an FX send is awesome when using it live I didnt think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that the thing is only 9x7 Its also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be The Xenyx 802 is a great buy Had I known I would like it this much I would have paid the extra and gotten the 12 channel one Great little mixer,positive
Its hard to really describe what this pedal does It doesnt distort flange echo or produce a chorus Id heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it And because words dont do an accurate job in describing it I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go As luck would have it I acquired one on trade and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr when placed at the end of my pedaltrain right before I run into the amp I dont feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amps tone though I do believe it works even better in a loop I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 USAAmpeg made and a Crate VC508 a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker and it was transformative to both amps tone in a great way It does very well with single coils Its a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in I dont think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures harmonics That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase I guess its rig dependent but its a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender Magical at times,positive
Well builtNot plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals outHas a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect soundSimple to use Great variety of uses for it I like the layout of controls as wellOnly bad point for me is the location of the adapter input its on the right sideId prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals Other then that nothing Id change Loyal Joyo pedal user Theyve got a great product for the price point Great Product,positive
The Danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with 3V to 9V by giving less power to them you can get some really spooky sounds great fun but can also help give you your characteristic sound I also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it like other adapters do The price is great Im planning to have several of this Spooky Sounds,positive
It cannot be denied that the BOSS DD7 is a versatile effective productAnd it does EXACTLY what it claims to do and does it well but I have a mixed relationship with this pedalOn one hand it does so many things with REVERSE MODULATE ANALOG settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings its a versatile tool in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing one thingIn a live setting you have to set it and forget it periodThe four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are UNUSABLE cannot be used in a live dark stage environmentso when Im at home putzing around on my guitar the BOSS DD7 sits on my pedal board and gets used but when I have a gig it gets pulled from the board and the MXR Carbon Copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category The MXR Carbon Copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions so it gets used up there when the pressure is onThe BOSS DD7 is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment ONLY if you go live with it good luck Its a Love Hate Relationship,neutral
this case is perfect for storing a guitar in I would not recommend using it for traveling anywhere unless in the back of your own vehicle it will protect your guitar but it is not a heavy duty case for the price this would be hard to beat by anyone acoustic guitar case,positive
This is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your Fender Mustang amp It is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised This switch is not bulletproof but works great for playing around with your small practice amp Simple Yet Effective,positive
Its a bent piece of metal with conveniently spaced slots and some sort of black coatingpowder coat paint who knows its blackIts heavy enough that it doesnt flex unnecessarily It has some heft to it so if youre trying to keep your rack super light be aware of that The coating is strong The prestamped slots go sideways so that if your gear does come loose it slips sideways and not forwards protecting the knobsI recently had to drill additional holes in one for a homemade piece of gear with totally random mounting hole locations and it took a while to get throughI like it enough that I bought another one Now I have two of them,positive
The cable came in the time it was promised It worked immediately upon installing it on my Yamaha keyboard to my windows7 computer My music program had no problem detecting it and using it Great Value,positive
I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated However the bag was ripped in 3 places The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights The holes in the inner poles were drilled in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anywaybit disappointing Not so much,negative
Great accessary for Yamaha keyboards Fits and works well Very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out Sustain pedal,positive
This stand rocks Literally I dont even have to play the guitar anymore it does it for meKidding aside this thing is really nice I added the boom stand so I can run an SM57 to the surround of my amps speaker I went ahead and ordered two for another amp just so I dont have to switch them out I have a couple of medium sized amps2 x 10s in each so I would highly recommend this stand for amplifiers around the same size This may not be so great for smaller amps AWESOMENESS,positive
Its a little stiff and Im sure it will soften up upon more use Cant beat the price I used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long stiff,positive
This little tuner is very precise Its fast and easy to use I got two of them It works better than the ones with a builtin mic that capture other sounds and make it difficult to tune your instrument Works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument Excellent little tuner,positive
I bought this unit for my sons edrums and because of the inputs RCA Mic Instruments I plugged my guitar in channel 1 mic in 2 his edrums on RCA and were good to go Not as loud as the 10 or 12 speakers of course but for small room this will do Playing music on RCA channel is also nice but you will need to adjust the EQ to get a good highs and lows Light weight and very portable Good for small room PAmonitor,positive
I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaulcom and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price I usually use DR Tite Fits but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90s I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup I will buy another set DR strings never disappoint Used with a Les Paul and a homemade Cigar Boix guitar build,positive
Theres not much to say about this product other than it can hold up a beer or water bottle really darn well Mounting it to the stand took all of 30 seconds and if feels sturdy as can be Easy to mount and use,positive
TC just does things right I love how easy this is to use the incredible clarity of sound and 5 minutes of recording time I do a single duo and full band It goes with me to all gigs and I do use it for when I am practicing Highly recommended solution Excellent,positive
Im enjoying it I actually bought it keep my amp off the floor but I also like that it puts the amp at an angle pointing upwards Its supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasnt tilted back or fallen over Im glad I bought it and would buy from the company again Thank You musicians gear deluxe amp stand,positive
Virtually eliminates all outside sound allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions Nice flat response Exactly what a workingrecording musician needs,positive
This microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received It is very well made equipment which is readily apparent to a total sound equipment novice like myself The item as pictured looks different from what I received it is not the all lighter gray plastic looking body base its more of champagne color and is metal and the screw on adapter on the bottom is black heavy duty plastic Not sure why the picture is showing that is because the actual microphone I received is much more impressive lookingI was initially looking to spend 125 on a simple home recording setup using my iMac I ultimately spent about 135 because I moved to a Behringer mixer board that can convey the appropriate power to a condenser mic like this oneFor those who are starting out with recording I recommend this microphone and a quality XLR cord and you will not be disappointed with your results Unbelievable quality for the price,positive
This jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required a 10 ft cable is too long I would not depend on it for night after night abuse but it just may last longer than I think Planet Waves does make good products Good for the job,positive
I like it Grip is good and the thickness is just right for me I wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is Simply good,positive
These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp Im using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a setIf you do stereo recording you cant go wrong with these their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear It sounds great and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away rain drops comming down and sounds you never would hearNote NEVER get these wet you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rainYou will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar but you already know that Stereo SET of mics at a great price and great sound,positive
this is a good quality cable and works just as I expected it to I like the extra cable clips that came with it so I can keep it wrapped up untangled very nice,positive
Its smaller than i thought it works fine and it picks the string really fast It does only tune in the regular A tune so E A D G B E So since its a gift for my father in law it works just fine but since I use a A flat tuning for my Gibson and even lower G for my Jackson it doesnt work for me Pretty Basic,neutral
Having recently purchased an Epiphone EL00 I went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to Graph Techs Tusq material It is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with The top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the Tusq bridge and pins the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional This was one of the best modifications I have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments I have a nut on the way to complete the upgradeI can barely wait I highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice Graph Tusq nut,positive
Dont let the term 34nylon34 fool you This is a really nice thick strap Nothing like those 5 cheap straps A great value and it matches my guitar that has a cool retro 50s pinstripe flame paintjob Great quality Cool looking durable strap,positive
For the price cant beat it Works as well as any 15 20 one I would have bought at local guitar stores Cant beat it,positive
I got this pedal recently All in all its a pretty nice device expecially for the price Seems solid and wellmade It has a nice big pedal for big feet It works smoothly I have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal My only gripe is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal 9V battery or a 12V plug in power supply Why the difference The really bad part for me is that I bought this to install in a newlypurchased Behringer pedal board which comes with a 9V power supply So in order for me to use this pedal in the board I will have to run two different power supplies or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboards power supply Behringerthis was not thought out very well Im now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle Bottom line the pedal itself is great but the power supply thing could be a frustration to youOne final note about Behringerthey seem to get bad marks now and then I really dont understand why I have two Behringer amps two of their stomp boxes the abovementioned pedal board and the volume pedal just discussed I really like all of them I have never had any problem with any of these items They perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price Behringers full range of products is so extensive that I see little reason to buy any other brand Im sticking with them Good Pedal one gripe,positive
Theres not a whole lot one can say about a guitar strap but Ill try This one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some Ive tried Its fairy thick and the material doesnt slip around on your shoulder easily Aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful The photo cannot do it justice The colors and rich and vibrant and the weave is tight not chintzy or frayed Im very pleased with the product and the price Sturdy and beautiful,positive
I love these patch cables They can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it Ive ordered about 3 batches of these guys and I would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex The length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes However there are many cables of much lesser value which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown Pedalboard Perfection,positive
Again these microphones are made for studio I use it live again you have to have a good PA System for these to work great Great microphone if you want to really sound like a real singer this is the top of the top Thank you Amazon ffsalsayahoocom,positive
I used this on a 5string bass I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated itHer reason for her opinion is simple This stuff puts out a LOT more oil or whatever it is than you would think This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hardearned callouses softwhich when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast and did for my friendTo apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string one string at a time I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard Thats ok You will need to wipe away the excess and Im telling you if you accidentally get too much that excess oil may not come off easily didnt for me at least Mine left little pools of oil between the frets and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there Naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling My friend hated that part too and I agree with her Soft callouses no callouses This is a good product idea and I like it in theory and with my thick bass strings I didnt have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for youIt does what it says but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers Good product idea could causes problems for some people,neutral
I have used Elixirs on all my guitars for the past 3 years and never been disappointed Their tone is great and the nanowebs feel nice when youre playingDisclaimer I would only recommend the nanoweb NOT the polyweb Elixir Electric Guitar Strings,positive
I bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D28 but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitarsImagine my profound disappointmentReally Boss This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the Top control higher than about 9 oclock At first I thought I must have a defective unit but then I started reading reviews online Seems like it is part of the design Its too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones hidden beneath a wall of fizz Totally unusable as far as Im concerned By the way I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat The engineers at Boss should be ashamed of themselves,negative
I really feel like this thing is my personal slave just standing off to the side waiting to grab my guitar when I hand it off It is reliable and rock solid The tripod base has been very steady so far It really is a great productThe other thing I have to say about this stand is that it has the nonscuff padding on the all the RIGHT places I bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material And it did but not at all the guitar contact pointsI do have to laugh at the folks here and on Musicians Friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following1 It ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward The basic idea is their guitar was onstage someone pushed the stand forward the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor REALITY Lets say the stand held onto the guitar It still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar Sometimes accidents happen Dont blame the stand Blame the moron who knocked over your guitar2 The guitar touches the floor Its not supposed to Try elevating the next or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitarThis stand is worth the extra money over those 15 disasters Spend an extra 10 and save yourself the headache The way a guitar stand should be,positive
I think this is my fifth Behringer pedal Admittedly I havent had the time to try this one out But based on my others Id say this will do everything the pedals that cost double or more can do Try Behringer,positive
Nothing special here If you dont like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you dont want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise There are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you dont want the logo on the front of the guitar neckheadstock You could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed I subtracted a star because I think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic Works as advertised,positive
Great sound and sensitivity Very well made These should last a lifetime barring any physical damage Made in the USA to boot These may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny Excellent,positive
These DAddario Medium Acoustic Guitar Strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set Being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting pointThe strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our autotuner and have held up wellHighly RecommendedCFH Good Replacement Strings Highly Recommended,positive
Great clone of a much more expensive Crunch Box pedal True bypass Knobs and switch are sturdy Great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels This is a Marshall type distortion more mids less scooped No Brutalzzz there are better pedals to cop the scooped 5150 or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing but you can get close with the right amp EQ and this thing dimed I agree with another reviewer this thing has a very high output so be forewarned the first time you plug in Unity is around 8 oclock on the level knob It gets thumbs up for the soundprice ratio If you dont mind a longer shipping time these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web This was my fourth Joyo pedal and I believe Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of pricequality Stack in a box for cheap,positive
I bought a 12 string one in blk Love it for simplicity and needed it so I didnt have to keep searching for the other Got gold to remind me it is for six strings 2nd one,positive
Long story short this string set has a strong metallic character which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much Many people might like it but for me absolutely NooooooooI have a seagull guitar so by its nature it sounds mellow warm and mild with stock strings So when my strings wear out I got this Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fenderarchtops neck position WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer Yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like SeagullsBottom line I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar If you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string I feel like playing an active EMG on my Fender guitar,negative
I am using it with a Musicians Gear music stand The shelf fits but moves easily when moving stuff on the shelf of the stand It is made out of plastic which flexes fairly easily and doesnt feel as sturdy as the metal shelf of the stand There arent any other options though unless you know some one who can do metal fabrication It is a good thing it does not cost a lot It works but moves around easly,neutral

First lets get the easy stuff done with This capo is beautiful It is clean with an even silver matte finish that looks good in the box nice packaging and equally good on the guitarThe capo is solid the spring mechanism feels good in the hand and when it clamps down on the neck you can see and hear there was thought put into the capo to make sure the pressure on the string is even and the neck is well protected No sharp points to damage the guitar And this thing is easy to use squeeze put on neck done You could easily move this during a gig and then store it on the edge of your neck when not using it I tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both When playing the strings behave as normal No odd muting or dropouts The capo is solid on the neckI have to say I have not used a capo in a while because the one I have is pain With this new capo I am happy to use it This thing is great Easy to use efficient sturdy looks nice and SOUNDS GREAT Great sound Sturdy Easy to use and Well padded Capo,positive

Thats not to brag but to illustrate my experience with AMPS Everything you can imagine This AMP ranks up there with the best of them Im surprised as Ive hated with a passion every DSP solid state amp Ive ever played This hybrid is incredible The effects are excellent The built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording It has many onboard effects but I have racks and pedals that outdo those so I dont use them for recordingIts not a band amp unless youre an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums Its 15 Watts but its loud its just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums though you might be fine for overdrive depending on the venue and situationIts not going to emulate certain amps like a VOX very well but it does excellent with a Fender Black face excluding the tube reverb It does a Bassman ok but doesnt quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original 59 Bassman Doesnt cost 11000 dollars other It does a Marshall pretty well Marshalls based on 59 Bassman without the delicate touch so theres no wonder The acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full yet doesnt sound like a filter 0 6 7 9 and 12 are amazing voices You can bypass that and use it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original Super ChampI also have a 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound When Im just playing around the house or need a quick recording and dont wanna have to dial in sounds with my Vox AC30 or Fender Deluxe Reverb then this my amp of choice It is miles ahead of a Fender Blues DeluxeYes this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp Ive played outside of a 2000 mesa boogieBuy it In fact buy two This is a future classic I have more AMPS than most people have TVs,positive
Before bying this product I doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings I received it and the first thing I did is try it IT CUTS THE MEDAL STRINGS LIKE BUTTER I used to use whatever I could find around the house which was a pain because nothing I tried could cut these metal strings The winder Im not going to use but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it It definitely cuts the metal strings no problem,positive
The stand arrived very quickly Came in a few pieces but took all of about 45 seconds to put it together the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar Excellent product great product for the price,positive

For 120 you get virtually every effect in the bookProsTuner works wellAbility to adjust presets on the computerClean sounds are great especially the reverb When spring reverb is used with the 65 Fender Twin amp model you can get a really great sounding drip much better than youd expect Delay and chorus are also pretty goodDownloadable presets on the internetConsDistortions and overdrives are pretty meh Nothing as good as even a DS1 pedal Nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive And nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdriveNo permanent preset In other words itd be great to have a clean channel that you could double tap to from any other preset No dice so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots That makes what seems like a lot 60 slots get filled up pretty fastIn the end its definitely worth the 120 I spent on it I recommend this if youre in the market for one This thing is great,positive
The J74s are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments They are bright and brassy when new and give a decent punch to the sound However because they are bronze they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier Also since they are roundwound they are harder to fret than a flatwound string and harder to shift up and down But the people who like them change them often like once in 30 days or so or whenever they play a gig to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume being less elastic and less lively One thing is sure that the J74s are loud and zingy and thats why dealers put them on their mandolins Some folks move to the heavier J75s to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops The J74s are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when youre in ensemble work Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance Bright Brassy when New,positive
For a cheap tuner this one is pretty good its about as accurate as the Snark and not as delicate the ball joint on the Snark makes it prone to breakage if youre not careful packing it in a case or gigbagThe display is large and bright I wouldnt use it to intonate an instrument but for quick knockaround tuning its fine Cant go wrong for the price,positive
Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks Highly adjustable tone volume and distortion level that wont tank your amplifier tone while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal I love this pedal The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amps tone but lose it when you engage your pedal Not anymore I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market but you wont find this quality and tone at a better price Joyo winSorry OS2 its pawnshop time for you Joyo Win,positive

Ive been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970s running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years I said all that bc I dont want to come off as condescending Ive learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of 9v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs Check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative Youll fry a Boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one Make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except Digitech which want 18 plugs Make sure the voltage matches A 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal wont power it Checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the Behringer pedals I use about six of them on my boardsee product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor I fried a BBE delay the same way Happy EffectingBehringer SM200 Slow Motion Effects PedalBehringer DD400 Guitar Delay Effect PedalBehringer CS400 Compressor Sustainer Ultimate Dynamics Effects PedalBehringer ADI21 VTone AcousticBehringer PB100 PreamplifierVolume BoosterBehringer PH9 Classic 90 Phase ShifterBehringer US600 Ultra ShifterHarmonist Ultimate Pitch Shifter Harmonist Effects PedalBBE TWO TIMER DUAL MODEDigiTech DGR Grunge AnalogDistortion PedalElectroHarmonix Micro QTron Envelope Follower PedalJim Dunlop M104 Mxr M104 Distortion DigiTech RP155 Guitar MultiEffects Processor Why many pedal effects dont work,positive
Stable and precise pick attack Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player I am buying more gauges too They last forever Excellent,positive
I got this to eliminate all of the cords that powered the effects units as well as get something to house everything securely This board does the job for at least 6 pedals The Behringer pedals fit nicely into the foam slots and so far have not moved around during play What I have to get used to is that the pedals are no longer against the floor meaning that I not have to lift my foot higher to get over the boards edge to press them It should just take some getting used too One concern is that the linked power cables dont have anyplace to disappear into I will be working on this What I am not happy about is that the board is ALWAYS ON when plugged in The only way to shut off the power is to unplug it I wish it had a power switch Great Pedal Board,positive
I received the Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner in a very short time I know it will live up to the Finder name Very easy to use Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner,positive
Works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my MXL V67G which is all I needed it for With a little effort it will work with an MXL V67G,positive

Cant go wrong Great quality on a budget price Hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up Its a Hosa,positive
This is a pretty cool item I bought I thought it was cool and different Is well worth the price and a good thing to have in your guitar case cool,positive
Im very happy with this stand It is heavy which I knew going in But for my purposes that is a plus The weight makes it more sturdy It folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight Adjusts easily and holds its position Sturdy and well made,positive
I got this when I was just learning how to play guitar I was using a borrowed First Act guitar without any amp and I wanted to see what kind of sounds I could make It was inexpensive and fun to use The sound quality isnt the greatest but thats to be expected You can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds Its very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable I pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects but I wouldnt want to take any chances Fun little amp,positive
Easy to install I used the guitars existing strap button screwsStraplocks came with black white felt thats a nice touch I think black looks better with my guitar Secure Easy,positive
Bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well Product is as described and fits mic perfect Will buy more in future Great to have,positive
Title says it all I guess it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness that Im not crazy about in Dunlops and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands Bought these 3 months ago and Ive got to say theyre very durable too certainly more so than the smallpick alternatives I tried Great thinner dunlopjazz alternative for sweaty hands,positive
Ive been using this brand of strings for years The super slinkys sound great The 9 gauge is very easy to bend and on a good guitar will also sustain well They last a long time if you wipe down after use Better yet get the Big Bends string cleaning wipes to increase the life of your strings Best set of strings for electric guitar,positive
Great deal on a capo its about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere It takes a while for the shipping but thats stated in the description I was pleasantly suprised I would recommend this capo good capo,positive
I bought this tube to test in a friends Fender HRD in the PI spot He wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain He liked the result when I switched out the GT 12AX7 I want to try a JAN 12AT7 next but the JJ is doing a good job for now Also interested in swapping out his GT Sovtek 5881s for JJ 6L6GCs 12AT7 in the PI spot,positive
Used this on my mandolin and it brought back the new instrument sheen it had lost months ago I sprayed it on a bit of cheesecloth used that to rub the instrument down then wiped with a soft Chamois worked like a charm Works well,positive
Its Daddario you cant go wrongGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Thanks Great,positive
These have been my favorite picks for decades now They grip very well and last forever and theyre a tiny bit more muted than other more 34plasticky34 picks Dunlops,positive
I have replaced my old tarnished screws with these They fit great and plenty of screws I am going to replace all my old screws with these Nice upgrade from my old rustling screws more screws than I expected Excellent choice,positive
This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole It would not work for an fhole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge If you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly Dont push it all the way in after moistening and you wont have a problem I drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole They cant be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings Ive never had one of these move from where I left itIf the sponge isnt dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case When the humidity is very low 30 or less the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isnt opened As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few daysIf you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar or dont want to see one use a guitar humidifier Especially during the winter heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels between 45 and 60 is ideal for most guitars Air conditioning can do the same For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitars is okay For many reasons its always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly A Good Basic Humidifier for Round Hole Acoustic Guitars,positive
One of the best accurate tuners that I have ever used I have been playing guitar for 45 years at this size accuracy you cannot beat this handy tuner Fits in most guitar cases is lightweight A good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks Korg,positive
Nothing too crazy here It holds your picks and sticks to your guitar So far so good Feels pretty durable Im sure it will last quite a while Does its job,positive
At first I wasnt sure what to expect from these DAddario Balanced Tension strings DAddario makes some pretty strong claims for these strings including greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings for evenly balanced bending strumming fretting picking plucking and slappingI cant really speak to those claims all I can tell you is these are darn good strings sound great feel great I recommend them highly Darn good strings,positive
I have a Line 6 Vetta II with a Floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects for gigs and in my studio including a wah pedal but sometimes I take my smaller Marshall down below to jam with friends I just needed something lowpriced that would do the job for me in that situation and I ended up with something a lot more when I bought this pedal I got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now I really like it and for the price I dont see how you can beat it It seems wellmade and I think or I hope it will hold up well with normal care Ive only ever used my Line 6 Floorboard and before that an old Crybaby for wah effects before but Ill tell you what I really like about this pedal Its springloaded so it comes back up by itself It says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah I dont even have to think about whether its on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways I never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage I also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because theres some sort of semiannoying hiccup in the sound sometimes It only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up so I can avoid it if I try I dont know if its just mine or is something inherent in this pedal Ill update this review if I ever figure it out Cant be beat for the price,positive
The pick holder work as described I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument Guitar pick holder,positive
Like all of Dunlop products this worked great Its real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance Im a Dunlop fan Convenient pick holder,positive
I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap but I dont know why Maybe other people dont really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before It wasnt too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap Unless youre just going for something that is inexpensive does the job and isnt designed for comfort I would pass,negative
I have bought 5 of these now for me and a few friends and they work great I am sure they will wear out in time so I have a couple extras but you cant beat them as good as the high dollar ones,positive
These are the best strings ever Ive tried almost every string on the market and these are by far my favorite They sound great and last forever Believe the hypethey really DO last FAR longer than any other strings and they sound great while doing itMany other strings will sound great for a short while but as soon as they get gunked up they lose any brilliance and tone and become dead sounding Not these They will sound great for the life of the string In fact the only way I know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good which they dont but because Ill start having intonation problems and I know the strings need to be changed Normal wear and tear does that but these strings last SO longIve tried the polyweb strings from Elixir as well but I didnt like those at all To me they didnt FEEL right Sticky or something not like your fingers stick to the strings but like you could tell they were coated With the Nanowebs they sound AND feel like regular strings but last forever The only string Ill use Best Strings EVER,positive
Believe this 5 feet Cable is no small thing The Jacks are high quality construction Very very durable The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable I plan on enjoying this Cable for many many years Im glad I bought it and thanks to Amazon who made it available The Best Electric Guitar Cable I have ever owned,positive
Ive been using HOSA cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced I particularly like the right angle plug It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars Thats still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables Im very pleased with it and recommend it Very Flexible,positive
Ive used these on the reg for a year Obviously there are better sounding monitors out there but these are really great for what you pay for IMOId recommend these to someone trying to save some moneyUPDATEtwo years in with continued regular use they sound just as good as they did a year ago One year in Going Strong UPDATE two years in going strong,positive
These picks do have a nice grip but they deaden the sustain on the guitar considerably They just arent quite my cup of tea Not quite my cup of tea,neutral
Just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me WOW I love it The capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well I am using it with a Seagull Entourage mini jumbo It sounds divine It makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull a nice mellow relaxed open sound Inspires my ears to make music Buy it LOVE IT,positive
I ordered this for my Epi LP Special 2 and obviously it fits like a glove Beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle Solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge Great affordable guitar case,positive
I recently bought an Audio Technica 2020 and was looking for a shockmount for it I bought the one that Audio Technica makes and I was not satisfied with the quality so I returned it and came across the Samson SP01 My first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount I have for my Neumann TLM 103 I immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the AT 2020 As soon as it arrived I put my AT 2020 in it and it looked stunning after I mounted it on my ondesk mic stand I bumped the table a few times to see how it worked In short it works great The SP01 isolates the mic extremely well I also tested the shockmount with my Studio Projects C1 and Rode k2 both very heavy mics and it works great One word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand which I find extremely amusing Like most shockmounts the Samson SP01 has an adapter that is too small for most US mic stands already in the mount the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand THIS IS EASY TO REMOVE All you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it Once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand Great Shockmount IT WORKS WITH ANY MIC STAND,positive
Theres nothing not to like about this capo I have two of them Ive played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos I like this ones low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard by turning a knob to tighten it rather than rely on a spring as on the clipon type It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clipon type but I like the results better Great capo,positive
I use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap SM58 wannabe from Radio Shack I like how I can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then I can easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach Definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well The locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth The smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient Just what I needed Very solidly built great locking clutch great mounted to a desk clamp,positive
The Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable Lake Placid Blue is a very good extra cord for a good price Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable Lake Placid Blue,positive
I bought this because I was going on a trip and needed an amp I could pack in my suitcase that would work with a batteryI had a similar amp before that died The Honeytone is very compact but looks cool and is very simple to operate with just three controls volume tone and gain distortion I found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume If you try playing clean with no distortion youll be underpowered The trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation I tried a regular electric guitar a lap steel guitar a slide guitar an acousticelectric guitar an acousticelectric mandolin and a silent banjo I thought the acoustic guitar would overwhelm this little amp but I was surprised that it added to the projection and wasnt bad on the tone It has a handy belt clip and a useless little leather handle just for looks I am using it to play an electric instrument in jamming situations where everyone else is playing acoustic and I can adjust my volume to blend in I think a mike with an unbalanced output 1434 phone jack would also work in here for street corner singing for instance though I havent tried that yet as all my mikes use XLR jacks and there would be the issue of a mike stand or a lapel or headphone mike with a phone jack output which might be hard to findOverall Im very pleased with this amp and it seems sturdy and reliable so far and at 20 a bargain Tiny but projects well,positive
For 10 bucks its a great piece Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass Battery IS included but it is very small and almost lost it Very good tuner,positive
So after reading a couple comments on this review its obvious that my original review was somewhat irrelevant being that I was using the strap for the wrong application According to the first comment and verified from their companies websitewhich I should have done before buying the strap is meant for a bass guitar Please dont purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass Amazon should have clarified in their item description Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading reviewIm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short I currently own two other leather straps and they have the potential to be lengthened so that my acoustic would hang down by my waist or so even though I usually play it about midway on my torso I dont NEED my straps to be super long but this thing makes it hard to even put the guitar on It just feels a little tight and crammed when I wear it Ill probably end up adding a string at one end just to give myself an extra 4 inches or so The leather itself isnt a bad quality but its not the finest Id suggest dropping an extra 20 or so and getting a very high quality strapI just wanted to clarify that I was reviewing this product in regards to my acoustic guitar I have read some other reviews and it seems that those using it for an electric guitar have no complaints but being that my acoustic is a good 23 times as thick as an electric it does not serve my needs not nearly long enough for large body guitars,positive
Good quality for the price Its a mic on a stand Plug it into an amp computer sound card karaoke machine whatever and belt out your favorite tune Is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet No my friend It is not Sorry But it is perfectly adequate for most purposes The stand that comes with is light and I wouldnt subject it to too much abuse dont invite Iggy Pop over hes rough on mic stands but it will do the job admirably if what you want is something to hold the mic while you wave your hands in the air like you dont care And youre gonna do that right Great mic for the price works well comes with a cord good stuff,positive
After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months I finally took the advice of other consumers MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve toneThis guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was I did put a light set of Daddario strings that made a world of differenceI was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddleWOW it really did make a huge difference This guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money But with the string and bone upgrades I cant imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic It changed the tone to that of a classical guitar I am so happy with my changesThe high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep The sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next I am so pleased and excited with my guitarIf you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddlechange them its a very quick fix And find a nice set of strings GREAT upgrade for my Yamaha 700 acoustic,positive
These stands are truly amazing They function perfectly for both acoustic and electric guitars and take up very little real estate in a room They are incredibly stable and have a nice thick cushion at the top so the guitar wont get scratched Amazing,positive
loved this thing I have since lost it as happens with little doohickeys like this lol worked good pretty precise meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy sometimes it felt a little off but robots know best right fun is,positive
If you are a mobile DJ that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these It saves me 5 minutes per event setup and break down just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event Great for mobile DJs,positive
Could not get to fit small sound hole Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all Would not buy it Does not work,negative
put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well Love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough I could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here Love it to death,positive
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price I have absolutely no complaints This is my first experience with the brand and I am not disappointed No Complaints,positive
We added this as an extension to our clubhouse PA system Its very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers Very nice,positive
Great for beginners and experts The sound is great and is easy on the fingers I got them recommended by a friend light strings,positive
This unit is the perfect solution for people whose amps do not have mute switches for tuning It has an absolutely silent mode that mutes for tuning without clicks or pops when switched in and its bypass tuner off mode is totally transparent to tone Its 4 tuning modes make selecting one that works best for you extremely simple I personally prefer full strobe Its tuning is quick and accurate and it doesnt hunt for pitches like some tuners will especially with a 6string bass Its single 9volt battery is only used when the mutetuner mode is activated so the battery should last a long long time The display is bright and clear Its rugged well thought out solidly built and simpleMy only complaint is with the calibration mode its just a series of nonselfexplanatory numbers that change when you hit the calibration button Its explained in the manual but could be clearer Id buy this again without hesitation though Best bass tuner Ive used,positive
I originally rated this pickup 5 stars However after using it for some time on dulcimers a mandolin and acoustic guitars some problems have turned upBasically the Cherub is just too sensitive It works well at lower volumes but as soon as you crank it up feedback city that you can not stop easily I put a rubber inner tube from a bike to reduce the sensitivity but still feed back and funny soundIf you are looking for a pickup to use at a dance or some other loud venue the Cherub will likely squeal as you crank it upIt sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup You can talk into your instrument Good at low volume bad loud,neutral
I cant do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer FOX If you havent started in the miccollecting business trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one Ive always wondered why I cant reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet and I finally realize its because they have the Shure SM7B and I dontIt enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives face it those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use Its very directional and selective rejecting room ambience and background noise so its perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications But for announcing broadcasting vocal performance and vocal recording I dont see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it The Grail,positive
I use this for my desk mic I use for recording It is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality especially for this price Definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future Cable fits my needs,positive
the suction cup does not work it looks like aged its very hard with room temp 70F I removed the rubber suction cup and I have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge it picks up sound OK but not great the suction cup does not work,negative
It supplies my microphones every time I run out Im glad I got this thing I rate it five out of five stars Its very good,positive
I ordered this bench for last Christmas 2005 Im satisfied so far Good value for moneyThe seat is generously padded and is 25 inches thick Padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinionAllsteel frame construction feels sturdyContrary to one of the reviews my bench came with height adjustment it is not onthefly kind of thing though Each of the legs has 3 holes low middle high A fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs and the bolt becomes the crossing point of X Three positions roughly correspond to 18 19 and 20 inchesFor changing height all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it Dont worry you dont need any tool to do the job thanks to a large plastic knob See the picture and youll understand how it worksMine initially came with middle position I also tried high and low but set it back to middle It seems to be a good compromise for my family as the bench is used daily by me my wife and my kids Sure its nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily However with this price I wouldnt complain at all Mine came with height adjustment,positive
This mixer is perfect for the price that is specified Although the blue LED power light is near blinding the overall quality and functionality of this product is fantasticI would suggest this anyone who is on a budget and would want a good quality mixer Awesome mixer for the price,positive
Very solid and I feel comfortable hanging my Taylor 414CE in this Easy to remove the guitar and easy to put the guitar back in and always feels secure Great item Excellent in every way,positive
Not much I can say about a standard mic stand Unless it was a cheap piece of crap This one is not Nice heavy base plate Here is my only complaint I went to remove the UPC sticker on the shaft and now I have a mess Ill try some WD40 to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud cant anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache And as an end user a UPC sticker serves nobody Why is it even there Put it on the box it comes in but get it off of the merchandise Im buying Does the trick,positive
Ive been buying cheap stands and Im never really getting what I want I finally bought this Nice and solid Solid,positive

This cloth works well in cleaning off the dust fingerprints oil and dirt off of my guitar It is thicker and bigger than the ones used with glasses cleaning so Im sure it can be used to wipe down other things as well Great polishing cloth,positive
These are good strings for a good price I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time Excellant Bargain,positive
Looked at a lot of cases most priced 90 or above Settled on this one because of price reviews and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit I have an Alvarez AD60 dreadnaught style body and it fits in this case nice and snug Solid well padded sturdy latches and everything lines up Very happy with my purchase Great case at a great price,positive

I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar After doing research reading reviews and checking it out in a guitar store I chose this oneIts much easier to play than the Squier and it has a better sound Like the Squier but not as bad it gets a little buzzy on the top strings I suspect it might need to be adjusted but I dont have a clue as to how to go about itIts also a good choice for women Im a small woman and I really like that the neck is smaller Its also fairly lightweightOverall Im happy with my choice A guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under 500 Maybe I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again Good for When Youre Ready for Your Second Guitar,positive
This little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size The locking knobs do their job without fail and I dont have to over crank them to get them to hold I use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer recording interface and all the other stuff I use for recording It adjust perfect for vocals and I drop it down if I want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup Same with my violins I get a different sound recording through a mic than I do a pickupThe base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way You must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction it will stand securely in any direction I set it where I want it then just swing it out of the way till I need it I have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics Its just more accessible on the desk This would work fine for drummersI would recommend this to any of my critical buddies Thanks Sampson MB1 Mini Boom Stand,positive
Practical useful for drum kit Tilts to match personal requirement Fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances Prof Mike Haller Drum Stick Holder,positive
I had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet But the wallet hasnt arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater But I suspected it would be before I ordered it so I dont count that against it Holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tightalmost annoyingly hard to get one out Will be sure to update if wear tear has any effect on the grip on the picks But so far so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends Cant complain,positive
This was a precent decent product I was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets Otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great I just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets Pretty decent product,neutral
Most better quality leather guitar straps are typically 20 or more so in retrospect the low cost of this Planet Waves Black Leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag I bought it anyway hoping that it would be a decent product but unfortunately upon receiving it I was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the itemWhile the strap appears to be 100 leather and isnt a piece of junk it doesnt appear to be of very high quality The leather is thin and soft and I would not be at all surprised if the edges soon begin to curl and the strap begins to wrinkle I dont expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts to hold up well long term If you use this strap you probably want to use some kind of strap locking systemI have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years The leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges While the leather has developed some cracks it is still holding up fine and there is no chance that the strap will tear I could be wrong but looking at the Planet Waves strap I have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as longIf you are a casual player this strap is probably fine although strap locks are recommended The leather may start to curl up and deform but the strap certainly isnt going to fail immediately While serviceable more serious players or those with an aggressive style of playing might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap I decided to keep this strap but it is installed on a secondary guitar that I dont play that much an economically priced strap that is an example of you get what you pay for,neutral
This mic is really nice I have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great Works great on voice overs singers and rappersThat said it wont outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today but with a little tweaking and the right preamp this mic can sound greatThere was one review that mentioned it isnt for female vocalists Ive only used it on one and it sounded great not as good as the one I used in studio but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available Great sounding cheap mic,positive
It was cheap Its not put together well so dont plan on taking this thing on the road Also on mine the boom arm is very difficult to extend but as it will staying in one location for most of its service life itll do Good enough,neutral
Order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring I didnt think that these mikes would give me the quality sound I needed for the price i paid great microphones for church use,positive
Peterson makes some of the best and most accurate tuners and their high end strobe tuners are a must for the professional guitar repair shop allowing for accurate intonation and set ups This tuner is accurate and I have even successfully set the intonation on a couple of my instruments using it although it is not intended for this purpose However I purchased it for the intention of taking it along to gigs in my guitar case Unfortunately due to the flimsy plastic construction I dont feel that it is up to the task and it would only be a matter of time before it gets broken if taken out of the house or on the road Far better off purchasing a cheap Snark tuner that if lost or broken wouldnt be a big deal to replace and is accurate enough for most peoples use poor construction considering price,neutral

Ive been using Ableton for 4 years and it never crashes I connected this interface with LIve 9 on windows 81 i set my default playback and recording device as 34Line Out Scarlett 2i2 USB 34 and set it as my default device It crashes every time in Ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on YouTube Sometimes i hears pops and clicks after 5 minutes and have to reset the ASIO4ALL driver which is the same issue with my Audio Technica at2020 USB MIcMy computer is an AMD system and i have used my at2020USB on a Dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience Ableton Crashes Even with latest Drivers and Makes a poping sound,positive
These are nice and sturdy picksThey sound real cleanIm having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic stringsI still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics Nice picks,positive
Ive been buying these strings for a while now They sound clean and crisp The best part is the price Good strings Great deal,positive
Comes with a capacitor so thats a bonus These pots are CTS and have a nice tight feel compared to Alpha pots Alpha are a little cheaper have basically the same tolerance are slightly looser in feel as you turn and get the job done pretty much the same What it really boils down to is whether you prefer a slightly tighter feel or a slightly looser turning knob Does the job,positive
Had one of these before but had given it away when I gave my old guitar awaywanted one again so found this one and bought it Works well Good for holding your guitar,positive
Bought this to hook up a Beta 58 to a Panasonic G2 DSLR and a Kodak Zi8 for interviews Works the way its supposed to 90 degree TRS is a nice touch Good price Does what it was intended for,positive
I love the concept and design of these picks save one flawthe rubber gripping goes down too far on the pick I dont know any guitar players that have their thumb on the entire pick and since it goes down so far its hard to pick clean without hitting the rubber on the strings sometimes I do love how they bend in the middle and the grippy rubber but I think they should scale the rubberization back a little bit Theyre nice but,positive

plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a Lepai amp not much else I can tell you plugged it in and it works,positive
I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 out of 100 to get any reasonable volume In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preampThis unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesnt meet my needs at all I am returning it Not enough gain,negative

Ive picked up a few of these for my various guitars Ive found it to be steady and stable and it hasnt left a mark on either my large archtop or my Les Paul The little locking strap that goes across the neck cradle is a big plus too Ive seen plenty of lesser stands for more money so this one is my first choice these days Solid and very affordable stand,positive
This is a beautiful shock mount However for the price it didnt perform The mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on Ps and Ss Not worth the price Overpriced,negative
The Planet Waves tuner works effectively on acoustic and electric guitars using the instruments vibrations to read pitch The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate is lightweight and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A440 Note that the photo of the tuner shows it on the headstock of a Fenderstyle electric guitar It works particularly well on the instrument shown because of the fact that the tuners are all on the same side of the headstock On something like a Gibson jazz guitar ES175 or one of the Epiphone or Ibanez clones for example its more difficult to find an ideal place to attach the tuner Classical and acoustic steelstring guitars are also a tad problematic too Its not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks its just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable rightside up Some headstocks too may be too thick in order to attach this tuner As long as it fits on your guitar the Planet Waves tuner is highly recommended Very Good Tuner A Couple of Quirks,positive
I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2 When I got it I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal As far as a CV controler it sucks at that too Why it squeaks as you move it after 5 minutes use right out of the box Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name although only conceived in GermanyIts a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares Im betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth itAlso you may say who cares if it squeaks a little well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a wah effect at low volume in the studioGood luck if you buy it Forget it unless you are flat broke,negative
I love this stand I am really disappointed in the cheap designedtofail boltin hardware used to adjust the telescoping rear legI think this stand can last a long time if you dont adjust it much but how much better would it have been had they designed one of those pressure collars with a flip tab so you are not limited to the holes drilled into the rear leg The other hardware isnt much betterFor a 50 list price stand On Stage took the cheap route rather than the quality route Well its only an On Stage product not Hercules KM or Atlas or Ultimate Support Cheap stuff a budget brand trying to pass as a name brandGreat idea though and the price is right at 25 street Hopefully a better make will put out something more roadworthy Great concept soso construction,neutral
Ukulele straps are a rare thing and Ive yet to find the perfect one This one gets close Not all uke players use straps some do and some dont Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced However I have two acousticelectric ukes and they are heavier than the nonelectrified ones the purists use Ive found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument lessThere is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well It ties onto the headstock I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument isnt balanced perfectly it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple SlingThis Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the twoThe wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument I dont know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instrumentsYou have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most Ive seen and this extra width reduces but does not completely eliminate that risk The wider clip spreads the stress out Ive seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and Im afraid to try them on a ukulele I like this one with the wide clip and will keep itThe Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device betterThe only thing I dont like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap But once on it is great You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you cant do it with a hat on It gets easier the more you do itId buy the Neotech Simple Sling again I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but dont want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on Ukulele Straps Are A Hard To Find Thing,positive
Ive used everything you can think of in the way of picks and the Tortex are one of my favorites I have at least 100 of them in various thickness and these and the Claytons are all I need The Claytons are great too but there are times that I want a different thichness and with the Tortex and Claytons you can find the perfect pick for anything you want to play They last forever and have a great gripYou gotta try them out Tortex Picks are simply great,positive
I bought these thinking they were the normal sized BIG stubby picks obviously they werent Theyre as sturdy as the BIG ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me I still think Amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but its still not too bad Great pick but not the BIG stubby,positive

My first review was a kneejerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it I couldnt get it to sound like I wanted it toI WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARSI must now rerate it with a 5 star This amp does almost too much for the money My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it tooWOW I never knew my guitar could sound like this It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out if I ever do The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settingsSo in short forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it If you are looking for a small plug and play ampthis isnt it But it youre looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities this IS it It is growing on me and I wouldnt part with it now I must edit my previous review,positive

Ive owned a TS808 since I purchased it used in the 80s for around 20 Yes this is a great overdrive This pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings Pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup now youre in tone heaven But the plain truth is this there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the 808 reissue This was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives I own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic its not the most transparent or versatile There is a mid hump in the EQ of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesnt Im glad I own mine but I dont think Id shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue If I am not mistaken both the TS9 and the TS7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time If this pedal came in under the 100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars I really hate to burst anyones bubble but SRVs tone was really in his fingers And so is yours Iconic but somewhat overpriced these days,positive
I teach class guitar in a community college and bought the SAT800 to loan to students during class I selected it for the rubber bumpers and beefy build expecting anything in this day and age to nail pitch quickly and accurately And indeed it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching Oddly in one year of use nobody has dropped it so the bumpers also provide a sure grip in hand and on music stand My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times as much as the SAT800 but managed to hit the deck several times a week Amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students However the display was larger and sported colored note names so it was more intuitive for beginner useThe builtin mic works fine in a quiet room but is useless in a classroom full of guitars as are all builtin tuner mics You need to use a tuner pickup and all is well I use a Korg tuner pickup If I were to nick pick Id have to say the letter name of the pitch is way too small on the LCD Its tucked in the far right corner in 12 point type and positioned just after the octave number A lot of students cant read or notice such small type Also the octave number immediately in front of the letter confuses many beginners as they assume it is the string number doesnt matter how many times I explain that it isnt Finally it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets it to A435 or whatever and causes a bunch of other students to be out of tune A lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade Most of these nick picks dont apply to pros or advanced players but are something to consider if youre a noviceAdd a calibrate safety feature and double the pitch name size and this would be a 5 star product Right now its a mere 45 Accurate tough,positive
The larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so I thought this might be the answer The answer is to treat your larger Snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesnt cut it I have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display Im quite disappointed and it sits here with no use It is cheap though Still to me it was money out the window I use Snarks everywhere except for this one,negative
I decided to try out the M5 in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board While I havent explored all of the sounds yet I have found some useable onesYou really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets Flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation Also factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so muchHere are some that Ive personally found to be appealing so farDelay Analog wMod a nice sounding Memory Man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalReverb Room standard adjustable digital delay not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicEnvelope Filter Tron Up a Winner fully functional and authentic envelope follower FUNKYSynthy Seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notesOctave Bass Octaver One note below only but quite effective especially for loopersYou will also find as expected with a multieffects pedal many unpractical downright sillysounding noise makers Not to say you wont find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless were talking about a 420 headphones session Also dont depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless youre using it as an addition to your amps lead channelConstruction seems pretty sturdy other than the Model Select button which is a multiuse knob with pushdown turn action and is cheapycheap Its awkward and uncomfortable to use fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up I already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presetsHaving the choice between TrueBypass and DSP is a really nice touch and unheard of on stomp boxes as people have different needs here depending on your signal chainThe tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position I do miss my KORG Pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connectionI personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually The M5 is serving that purpose The sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist They should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone Just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package Economical And Useful,positive

Although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked the attack knob the control for how much compression you want to apply did absolutely nothing I even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack settingPerhaps my pedal was a rare defective one but nonetheless I returned the pedal back to Amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board NonFunctional,negative

I put the set on my Squire Jazz Bass with threaded bridge rollers If you dont like loading up the tuners trim a few inches off the leads theyre about 89 inches and have no cloth covering like Fenders I usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the FlexSteels have overall less tension I let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing yeah ironic for a set designed for slappingGave them a good stretch and theyre holding pitch well I find the windings on the FlexSteels more comfortable than Rotosounds at least comparing newtonew That helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shiftingOverall Im more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and theres plenty of piano lowend sproing Squire Lake and Ray Bennett fans will feel right at home fingers or pick The set is so brightsounding in fact I had to roll a considerable amount offThe label says Light TopMedium Bottom 456585105 I found the gauge balance between the low EA and the high DG a little more pronounced than Id like but not outright uncomfortable Comfortable Alternative to Rotosounds,positive

At this price range this little effects pedal does admirably You can get pretty decent sound out of this No need to spend a lot especially if youre on a budget this is pretty good I took off one star because the tone is sort of weird sounding in highgain situations Other than that Ive had no problems Holding up well Good,positive
This is my first amp which I am using with my new Applause AE148RRB Acoustic Electric Guitar also purchased from Amazon The guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp My only complaint is that as a first time amp owneruser I needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with NO paperwork at all Not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit I received I downloaded the users manual from the Pyle website but it was also not much help But just by trying different settings I have managed to find what for me is the 34sweet spot34 for my guitar when paired with this amp Very happy with the amp and also happy that I spent the extra few dollars to get the 60 amp rather than the 30 amp version Sounds great,positive

I never had one of these until I had to twist each tuner around 60 times to change a string But thats not a problem any moreI used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends But thats not a problem any moreAnd I used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic But thats not a problem any more eitherAll solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case So Im a fan Youll be too Handy tool to have around,positive
I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the linein ports for recording and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digitalaudio conversion I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cablesI purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the Behringer UF0202 That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things a volume knob and balanced inouts The volume knob thing I could work around but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops even with a ground lift plug so I needed to go with balanced cables Im glad I did The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems This was a good purchase However I would say to anyone who doesnt need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer Its a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well Further its class complaint so you dont have to use Behringers drivers Its plugandplayI have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 all about the hardware and some bad things all about the software Ive tried using the driver version 21 which came with the disk and the udpated 22 which I downloaded from Focusrites websiteTo let you know what I need in an interface1 Balanced stereo inout2 High quality headphone amp3 Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4 Good digitaltoanalog conversion5 Low output latency input latency not important to meI dont use the Mic preamps which is one of the big selling points of this device The Good This box is simple and welldesigned It does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality Im pleased with the digitaltoanalog conversion It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp It has switches so each input can be a linein or microphone preamp It has a switch for zerolatency monitoring of whatever is coming in The headphone amp was of particular concern for me I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem The Behringer headphone amp was only ok Specifically it has an output impedance of 50 ohms The rule of thumb for good headphoneamp matching is that the output impedance should be 18 the impedance of the headphonesmy hd 595s have 50 ohms of impedance Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass Most manufacturers dont list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed Anyway Focusrite does which is one reason I trust them a little more The output impedance is less than 10 ohmsrespectable but not amazing Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones Theres plenty of extra voltage here too so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary Anyway good headphone amp Check Balanced ins and outs work very well The ins accommodates a 14 TRS style in and XLR The light around them shows when somethings actually coming in and shines red when its in danger of clipping Theres lots of gain available I have them turned all the way down almost The outs are TRS style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back I like the look of the box with a red metal case and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well The USB cable is just a type B port This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever The Behringer for example was hardwired to its cableking of annoying Its buspowered I actually would have been fine with a wallwart but this is even more simpleI really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware The Bad The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software acrobat reader and this driver I mean my computer is really stripped down Performance using the Behringer was good The latency time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers was 8 ms using the Behringer which isnt really perceptibleUnfortunately the focusrite driver though its technically ASIO apparently doesnt have anything like an acceptable latency The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy Its very difficult at least for me to work with a large latency like thatI was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL Thats sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturers driver perform at a decent level I installed it and it worked The output latency was a tiny 43 ms only 3 of which are actually output latency so this is REALLY impressive I conclude that the hardware is very very good in this machine but the software is horribleUnfortunately you cant actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesnt recognize the device and it never even turns onits not class compliant unlike the Behringer So now I have two drivers for it installed only one of which I useThe bad news is that this configuration is very buggy In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer The funny thing is that it doesnt matter where the buffer starts out I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out I can start it out with a huge bufferlots of latencyand it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more I have to do this every time I turn on the computer Also sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step We are talking about major bugs hereI decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work againmaybe there was a setting I was missing As I was trying to set the buffer size I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted When it came back I couldnt get good sounds out even when I turned the buffer way up Tried rebooting a few more times still didnt work So I uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software At first it didnt work I had to install ASIO4ALL as well and now I can sort of get sounds out of it half the timeI hope you are getting the idea These drivers are terrible Awful A monkey could have written a better driver I would give it 1 star if it wasnt for the fact that the device works very very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play I guess Im willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works I would never use this in a live situation or when time is criticalThe good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them Im hoping for that They have already revised the driver once which is amazing because even the 22 driver is seriously an abomination just like the 21 Closing Thoughts Unfortunately there really isnt a USB interface that has a good driver The Behringer driver always worked but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver However you didnt have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications Thats about as trouble free as Ive seen in this type of deviceIf you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the MAudio Fast Track Pro probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite what you get is a bunch of comments just like this onehorrible horrible drivers that never get fixed Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well the Onyx Blackjackbut the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time Maybe its better under mac I dont knowInterestingly this is really the only USB 20 device in this range Thats quite shocking considering how long the USB 20 standard has been around The only real implication of this is that the USB 11 devices like the MAudio and Presonus can only do two channel 2496 audio in OR out not both at the same time Theres not enough throughput in USB 11So in light of the competition the Focusrite looks kind of ok Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturersat least in this range of devicethink theres no need for good hardware and especially good software At least the hardware in this one is up to spec We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the futureBottom line this is a fantastic 5star deviceif you can make the software work consistentlyIf you are on a tight budget or dont care about balanced inout Id recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020 They are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers If you use a high impedance headphone with it even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one Update May 2012 A new version of the driver 23 came out since the writing of the above The new driver actually works I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency Once in a whilenot too oftenit will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer If I dont change anything most of the time it works ok I would never use this in a missioncritical setting ie gigging or pro work but for my home use its good enough now If you have issues with the driver definitely update Excellent hardwareHorrible driver,neutral
I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it I change strings and toss those white plastic pins Makes any guitar look so much classier I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too Phenominal value tons of bang for the buck They look SOOOO good on there Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far Great addition to any guitar,positive
these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing They have a great sound for finger picking and even with a pick they still sound good wonderful,positive

I first installed one of these in a new laminated guitar to test it and I was truly blown away by the quality of the sound I had purchased this guitar for practicing during our cold and dry New England winterThe sound was so good that I ended up putting another one into my prized 1973 Guild Madeira built in Japan This guitar sounds much better than the laminated Fender does and this pickup reproduces it accurately through my Fender amplifiers clean settingI tried attaching the pickups in various positions but found that I liked the sound the best when the pickup was attached slightly below towards the bottom of the guitar and slightly favoring the treble strings side of the bridge just off center in the lower XbracingYouTube has several good installation videos that show you exactly howto install an acoustic pickup such as this oneIve used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces Its wonderful no longer having to keep the guitar perfectly still with relations to an external stand mounted microphoneIf you wish to record your acoustic guitar this is an effective and very inexpensive solution for that Amazing quality of sound from such an inexpensive pickup,positive

This is a very sturdy and wellmade bag Much better for the money than I was expecting I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice My uke is very cozy inside The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks kazoo ukulele stand whatever you need to have with youI carry an iPad around when I play the full size iPad doesnt fit in the outer pocket so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside An iPad Mini would probably fit Great sturdy wonderful,positive

This tuner is great and well worth the 15 you will pay for it at most places but Ive seen it as high as 3035 and that is just a rip off Great product but dont pay more than 15,positive
Yup its OK Nothing special I dont know if its the best one out there but it does the job Its OK,neutral
This pedal is based on the famous Ibanez TS808 pedal My hats off to Behringer for doing an excellent job of recreating the classic sound in an affordable package I dont own the TS808 but I do own a TS9 and while the TS9 does offer a nice gritty overdrive overdrive that has enough bite to bring your tone out in a mix the TS800 offers a warmth and a sweetness that Ive simply fallen in love with Several of the classic tubescreamer characteristics are audibly present Slightly rolled off bass and a bit of a midrange hump with a tone control that offers useable tone at any setting I usually max out the level knob and adjust the drive know to tastewhich never exceeds 12 oclock Ive found that this setting gives my tone the most body and depth I use this pedal primarily with my Jet City JCA20H head just to pump it up a little bit This combination takes me straight into Guns n Roses or that type of 80s90sera rock territoryUsed over a clean tone the TS800 offers a very warm smooth bluesy overdrive that can either be more of a clean boost or add some grit depending on where you set the drive knobThe pedal is made of plastic and while it seems solid enough its the only area where this pedal really merits any criticism But considering that Behringer is offering this pedal for its clear that in order for Behringer to offer such great tone at such a low price sacrifices in build quality had to be made That being said I dont feel concerned at all that this pedal will suddenly break on me dont be too rough with it and it should last a good while Warm smooth overdrive that leaves little to be desired,positive
Construction is fine and you can set it up in 30 seconds It holds my bass just fine and the swiveling bottom is not an issue for me I dont know why some people hate it The rubberized neck holder protects the wood and the strap keeps the guitar in place For under 10 and prime eligible what more can you ask for Works great for my bass,positive
For the price im really happy Its my first one i get and its perfect im learning how to use it and its not as easy as you guys think Really Good,positive
In my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually I fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beautyjust be sure to buy theKorg CM100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing One of the nicer tuners at the price point,positive
When you get it it looks so simple so basic that you cant believe that it doesnt come with the mic but companies got to make their money right I use it with my Samson CL8 condenser and it is perfect Works great for podcasting vocals or anything else you want to record The adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever it does its job well Great shockmount,positive

This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitars output while playing outside on the porch The amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the housesWe also like that this has a headphone jack which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged inHighly RecommendCFH Very Impressed Highly Recommended,positive
The tuner I choose is very easy to use simple and small Good for people who dont have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument I recomend it Very Good,positive
Hey it does its job for a cheap price I use it put mh guitar and Harp Mic through the same rig It does that It is plastic and Im not sure its inputs are the most efficient setup but again it works Which in the end is my concern Not bad,neutral
Arrived on time and as described The strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come It is basic and not fancy It does the job is comfortable and the price is right I have four of these Pro Tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years This one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea So far forget to use it but that will come Price was right,positive

this is a nice little pedal It effectively quiets all my other pedals Works as advertised Not much else to say Get one Does what its supposed to,positive
I like the adjustable tension of this capo I dont think its as easy to put on a Kyser capo of this style but once on the neck the Planet Waves NS TriAction Capo moves easily and has even pressure across the fingerboard a result of the adjustable tension I surmise Some day I will use the pick holder not right away some night when Im feeling I need my pick held Good design from Steinberger,positive
I thought this was the coolest guitar gadget I use it often but find it is not very accurate I use my iPhone app Guitar Toolkit tuner and that works much better If you tune with the snark then Guitar Toolkit you can see the difference Handy gadet But not the best,neutral
These cables are great in microphone or DIbox applications They are clean of any electrical noise Having color coded cables are also good too This product ships as expected,positive
Quick snap on and off Sturdy If it is not convenient it wont be used In this case it is very convenient and easy to use hence your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident Well worth the money spent dont let your guitar fall,positive
I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick Its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings Does the job,positive
Received promptly and tested out with acousticelectric guitar The sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances The treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine The small amp is just what I was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus I havent tried it yet since I can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a 14 inch RCA plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time Behringer AT 108 review,positive
I got mine in a trade for practically nothing I figured I could sell it and make a few bucks saw the Mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility looked like a toy to me Anyway I decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little 8 inch speaker I researched and found there is a program called Fuse that can interface with the amp I downloaded and linked to the amp there I saw you can make a lot of changes that cant be done with just the knobs I saw it had a Deluxe Reverb setting I have the Deluxe Reverb Reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software To my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my Deluxe Fender really got close with the modeling I went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between 2 settings I liked it so much I went out and bought the Mustang II I almost like the Mustang I better but the II does have enough power to gig with if you arent a loud band I will leave my Deluxe Reverb at home for my next small gig and use the Mustang maybe even the little one and mic it up NICE,positive
This is great for those who already own strap locks and just want to gear up the rest of your collection no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use the price was ok Decent price for Good product,positive
Im not sure how much I can say about a mute Its easy to put on and take off and it does its job It mutes the violin to a reasonable level I used an SPL meter at a distance where a sustained open G string gave a reading of about 2db With the mute it dropped to 6db I then tried a Yamaha silent electric violin unplugged and from the same distance it barely registered I recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about 1db and the Yamaha read about 6db at that distance and settingSo it wont make your instrument completely silent and from a purely subjective perspective it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin perhaps seeming about 10 to 20 louder had I not measured itWith accessories tonal quality is typically important But with a mute you expect it to deteriorate Surprisingly there was still a lot of tone left especially compared to the unplugged electric yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introducedYou cant expect this to give great sound or complete silence but it wont disturb the neighbors or their dogs and it wont make the instrument sound dead This is about 15 times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin and the latter will probably sound worse Its not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice Does its job,positive
another item never received but i would not use anything over 88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase to big,negative
There are some things in this life that you dont want to have to think about and your tuner is one of them You have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner It is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board It is true bypass and doesnt add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all Your brand preference will guide your decision but dont shy away from this wellmade piece of equipment I would buy it again Gold Standard,positive
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars easily stretched and tuned with no problems You can not go wrong with DAddario strings Excellent strings,positive
Id suggest that this is not for beginners More for the intermediate musician It is not something you are going to understand at first The learning curve is moderate Other than that quite useful and durable Excellent tool,positive
The strings sound great on my full size acoustic nice bright but warm tone full bodied sound but not so great on my 34 size guitar Pretty good,positive
I swear by these quick release clips I cant imagine working without them I save so much time each time I use a quick release clip instead of unscrewing and rescrewing the original clips These are a great way to to mix and match multiple clips with multiple stands The first items I purchased when I started my last job as an Audio Engineer was these Ive got no complaints They work great every time Ill Always Use These,positive
Big disappointment Ive been so impressed by Epiphones but this one didnt do it Quality of manufacture and assembly great Pickups far less than inspiring Yes its a great platform but was so expecting those P90 sound I may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it Just didnt have the tone and bite I was expectingI could certainly invest in some PUPs but I have too many great P90 guitars to bother Roll of the dice I guess Expectations perhaps a bit too high,negative
I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singers microphone It would be great on a guitar mic or something thats close to the ground or horizontally placed but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand Nice utility wish it had a little more length on the split cable,positive
For the money they are great look nice are very easy to install you will like them on the guitar Very nice,positive
This stand was purchased to replace my older bass guitar stand which was weak and falling apart I neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect Great stand,positive
So these picks are really nice but the picture is not what you will get These picks are translucent purple Other than the strange color they are good picks They really do help with speed and accuracy Great for mandolin playingUpdated Amazon has changed the image for this item so now the picture really does show what you will get These Are Purple Not Black,neutral
If you are using ElectroHarmonix Red Witch Voodoo Labs or the larger MXR pedals they wont fit in the styrofoam cutouts You can though just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the boardI also have a Morley wah and they have big footprints so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board If you have a Cry Baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably Right now I have the Morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals I own and that four of them are a little outsized MXR ten band EQ EHX Electric Mistress Seymour Duncan Tweak FuzzThere is some hum but it isnt so pronounced that it interferes that much with your soundSo for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters except a DOD Malmsteen preamp overdrive this is a great deal Of course the durability is still in question at this point Great Pedal Board But With a Couple of Minor Caveats,positive
These are super strings They will last and last and last and give you great sound Easy to put on and tune Strings,positive
I love these tuners I have tried the intel krog boss etc and out of all of them I like the Snark the best Response and visual display are awesome Unlike a couple of the others Ive used the Snark works well on any place on the headstock A couple of the other brands I had to be careful where I positioned them because they didnt respond well You cant go wrong with any Snark Super nice,positive
Youll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum My own opinion about this is I Love it I play the guitar privately not live in public and I have no complaints at all I still use it all the time and learn something new everyday I love this thing,positive

A Little HistoryI have been a guitar player for fortyodd some of them VERY odd years For the first thirty of them I tuned by ear starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like then tuning the other five strings by fretting listening and tuning I could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord yet remained off for others it took quite a long time to get it right Then about ten years ago I thought I had figured it out The problem I thought was that my guesses at a true E were off so I got myself an E tuning fork 320 cycles and used it to tune the first string Then I did as I had always done fretted and tuned the other five Not much better as a result kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right During those years I tried tuning all six strings to what I believed was an accurately tuned piano as well as by ear to tones available online Nothing gave me better tuning on the first try Then I saw an ad for a Chromatic Tuner and lightening struckThe RealizationThere have been many each of which has led me closer to what I have now near perfect tuning on the first go round First off I realized that when we say E that is not just one note It is a range of literally hundreds perhaps even thousands of specific tones The same is true for every note This is akin I guess to the realization as a child that no matter how many shades of blue are in a box of crayons the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare Purchasing my first Chromatic Tuner a CT440 manufactured by SwitchMucic and sold through MusiciansFriendcom moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning However that tuner had at least two limitations Firstly its construction is rather light and flimsy it works OK but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the Korg for about the same price That is that the Korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you Both tuners have plugin for electric instruments and so far as I can tell their accuracies are similar I prefer the Korg for the reasons I have mentioned Additionally the Korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs and remembers the original tuningtones so you can return to it for more standard usage A nice extra piece of flexibility The LCD meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you right away whether you are sharp flat and by how much or right onAs a point of surprising interest the tuning fork I had used for years turns out to be profoundly FLAT A shock to me given that I had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones I have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be I guess the round pitch pipe that Ms Sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumedAnd FinallyThis is a marvelous little and inexpensive device well constructed accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances I assume that there will be still higher places for my learning curve in this area to rise to but for right now this is it I am using it regularly on all my stringed instruments two sixstring Martins a twelve string Epiphone and a frailing banjo The time it saves tuning the 12string alone makes it more than its own priceIf you have not discovered Chromatic Tuning maybe I really WAS the last one to discover these things I suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds really right Perhaps people with perfect pitch can do very nicely without a Chromatic Tuner I am not one of them Are you From the IceAge to the NewAge for cheap,positive
I needed some little easy and portable guitar stands for the stage This does it perfectly well While being light and portable Perfect,positive
I like this speaker system behringer makes good products when it comes to this The sound is good and loud you can control the levels and EQ directly from this so no need for a mixer You can connect an ipod or laptop to it And there are multiple sound options including phantom and instrument I used a female xlr to 14 trs cable but I have been told you can also use xlr to xlr although I did not try it The price was great and the wattage was nice I must say when we have people come over it is easier to hear them sing With me playing on the piano it is sometimes hard to hear their voices but now it is equal and sounds nice in harmony I also connected to microphones to it and it distributes the sound very evenly so it sounds good in a duetUPDATE I recently bought a guitar and started to use this amp for my electric fender IT WORKS GREAT The sound is great the wattage is good everything is wonderful Highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar Nice Convenient Good Sound,positive
I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove I love the tone and the reverb for 100 is amazing The dirty channe is what it is but the clean channel is worth the price of admissionI can imagine using this guy for a small gig but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further this really is a great little ampUpdateIf you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website Classic sound on a budget,positive

First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS1 I have enjoyed playingpracticing a lot more with this pedal I have a Fender wannabe guitar and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isnt the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested I am having so much fun that I dont even notice my fingers hurt anymore Honestly this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police dont come a knockinupdate Sept 2012It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge I am glad I got the DS1 but for other reasons Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock Again for the money I dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive OCD or Boss OD3 but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need In closing spend the 40 buck and get thisand then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later Great 1st Pedal updated,positive
The products work great applied them to my new Les Paul Ukulele for protection The strings that came with my ukulele were junk so I decided to replace them with aquila strings Prior to doing so I decided that I would like to prep the fret board The frets seemed a little rough and the rosewood looked a little dry to me soI ordered this kit to see what it would do It comes with both fret board cleaner and even a very fine grit emery cloth for the metal frets I thought I would try the emery cloth on the frets and was very pleased with the results The frets are now very smooth and shiny and the rosewood fret board looks like it is much happier after a little drinkThe polish for the instrument brought out a deep lusterbut remember a little goes a long way so the wax should last a very long time as I am sure the other products will tooThe cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument Mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival That is the reason I did not give this product a 5 star It looked like the package was damaged prior to shipment since the out side package was pristine and the product was protected well inside with adequate paddingI am now going to work on my Gibson Les Paul Custom Guitar and I am sure that I will be very happy with the resultsGreat product which would deserve the full 5 stars if it was packaged a little better Product works great but lost a star due to damage of the products package,positive
Mounted and this looks like a solid product I was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes I just looked at pics on the net and got them close I like them Really nice,positive
It does the job but it is a little low on the quality side Surprisingly it is not that stiff not surprisingly I think that has to do with the qualitythickness of the leather I dont know if Im slower than the usual folk but it took awhile for me to learn to adjust it you have to remove the 34buckle34 strap to readjust the strap to lengthBottom line It works and I feel comfortable with it supporting my axe Not stiff Thats both desirable and undesirable I think,neutral
Easy accurate and best of all it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing Ive tried other brands and they dont swivel correctly Best Ive Ever Used,positive
I have bought several small tuners through the years but this one has become a favorite It is Tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible It fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front There is a metronome function which I havent used Simply strike a string If it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars When the key is in tune you will see a green indicator light and 1 bar on each side I dont know how dependable and how long it will last since I have only had the two for about a month Great little tuner,positive
Great all around mic used for vocals No frills tough as nails and great sound for live music If youre buying your first mic or switching from a cheapie and intend to use it for singingvocals this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation Ive never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic that came with some bundle 10 years ago I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly You can stand 3 feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in betweenThe SM58CN comes with the mic 25ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip The standard SM58 does not have a switch one less thing to break and I dont miss it but the SM58S does have it for a few dollars extra Great allaround vocal mic,positive

I really think it doesnt matter which Snark you buy they are all set up to measure tuning within any instruments range It was cheap and affordable One of the issues Ive had with Snarks is that if you get the one with the vibe and the mic the mic quits working and you really only need the vibe anyway so why pay more Good little tuner,positive

You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another However you cannot go wrong with those strings I highly recommend them I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried Great strings for my Ovation Celebrity,positive
It does exactly what it says it does My only complaint is I wish it could go a notch or two lower But very pleased Its cheap and works like a champ as expected,positive

I just received this a day ago and bought it on whim after being very impressed with the Joyo Crunch Pedal This is I think based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal Its supposed to be very reactive to your playing Dig in and it puts out distortion play soft and it cleans up This is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp I can say its pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer Ive heard some say they find the distortion from this pedal a little harsh but I find is wonderfully smooth with some grit I found it really warmed up my sound in a good way Im playing an american strat with noisless Dimarzio Area pickups through a Vox AC15 and its an awesome combo I put this pedal in front of my OCD and I was really getting some sweet tones If I had to play out with just my amp and one pedal for a little dirt this might win over my OCD Its expensive for a Joyo but cheap for a really good OD stomp Its definitely not for metal or heavier distortion stuff but its got plenty on tap for blues and classic rock So far Ive been super pleased by Joyo pedals The jury is still out on how well they hold but but they sure sound and perform pretty darn well Pleasantly pleased great pedal,positive
It didnt naturally fit onto my Blue Yeti mic which is weird since this IS a Blue mic and its supposedly universal but whatever i made it work For 10 more dollars instead of the meshy pop filter you could have this one which looks and feels like itll last a looong time If the pop filter fit on right i would have gave 5 stars x Good price,positive
I own a few tuners including a Boss Tu70 Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT1 clip on tuner I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use But now I have to say I think the Snark is a little better I bought the SN1 and the SN2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate The other great thing is they are chormatic so besides being a great tuner you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard The display is very easy to readbetter than the GoGo although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine I love the colors and the matte finish too The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs itits a no brainer New Fav,positive
I bought a new guitar got it a day before my fingerease was delivered My fingers were squeeking sticking on the strings back of neck BADAfter applying fingerease no more squeeks much easier to move up down the fretboardThis stuff has been around for years1st time I saw it was 40 years agoCant argue with that track recordIf you never used it get a can you wont regret itJoe MUST have,positive
4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing wont tune your guitar or carry your amp I use this solo in a duo with a bass player in a trio with drums and bass I have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room I use it through a Pyle Pro self contained Pa into which I also plug my Martin GRP elecacoustic The sound quality is excellent The volume seems limited only bny what the Pyle Pro will put out I would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and PA I havent heard a hint of feedback and the onoff switch is a plusThe 3699 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to I bought a 3234 Toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks Think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less The same is true of a lot of Audio Gear A lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but its great to have a company like Shure make something so good and so affordable They have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford I cannot recommend it strongly enough Buy This,positive

I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams but alas I was wrong The winding apparatus works beautifully but the cutter doesnt allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference so Im back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post All in all a good product to have if you dont have pliers on hand or dont mind getting a closer snipI cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesnt have pegs luckily the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place Each to their own I suppose Houston we have windage,positive
I ordered these because I wanted to deck the tremolo on my Strats because I dont really use the trem I have a modern American Standard and an American Vintage Reissue Hot Rod 62 Strat There are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as I can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black My Standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 Hot Rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with Easy to install and works like a charm Perfect replacement,positive
Just exactly as stated this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand Holds 6 picks It is exactly what I wanted for a great price ThanksEditing this review to say that today I got a few thin picks and the thin picks do not hold in this Mediums do great but the thin fall right out Fine for me because I will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone Great little product,positive
Ill never use another string on acoustics The reduced finer squeak the long lasting coating and the great tone of these strings is wonderful Ive tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated but come back to these every time Last 3 or 4 times as long for twice the price so theyre actually cheaper in the long run,positive
Shipping was fast Got to me in two days And its a great midi controller I use it for fl studio to make beats I just plugged it in and I set a timer to get good timing ratios for it and it installed in 86 seconds flat and when I went in fl studio and selected it and tried it out with some sound kits but it was slow recognizing like Id press the keys and it wouldnt recognize right away then I remembered the asio drivers werent activated then I activated them and every key Id press it would recognize immediately Great buy I hope if yall get one Its great and making beats is so much easier now then pressing the keys on the regular computer keyboard Great for fl studio but Im not to sure about other programs,positive
Ive only had these strap locks for a couple weeks however theyve performed well so far The fail proof U holding the guitar is what sold me on these I would recommend these strap locks over any others currently on the market but Im working on designing a better lock Schaller Security Strap Locks,positive
When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X15 foot controller I came across these Hosa ones and they were 2 dollars each As they are now 6 I realize I would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly You must realize that they are only 5 feet as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer For any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect I Got Great Pricing But Still a Really Good Product,positive
I bought the 73 mm picks I would consider them medium thickness If you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness The 73 mm is right for me I really like them Great Picks,positive
this is very easy to put the guitar in to because it zips around the whole end and can be carried in your back gig bag,positive
Excellent steel guitar strings each string has a color coded end each 6string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where Purchased a 3 set box and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness I went with the mediums Try the light if you are a beginner Excellent steel guitar strings,positive
Dunlop slides are nice and smooth with rounded edges they sound great theyre indestructable so far and theyre supremely affordable I own a few of them I prefer a shorter one most of the time but I use this one often as wellSure you can spend more on a slide but I see no reason to Perfect,positive
Like it better than the other tuner I bought this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again Love it,positive
I really and suprisingly like this little gadget It works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate A,positive
Im updating a previous negative review I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived I couldnt get it setup the action was very high and I couldnt set the intonation Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp and I couldnt lower them with saddle adjustments I missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered Setup is finished and I can now agree with most reviewers For the price this guitar is far better than any others in the price range I know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile If it ends up as a dust collector Im not out much on the purchase price Ill add it back to my own collection and upgrade the electronics A Great Guitar for the Price,positive
Subjective Nice thing is that its fairly transparent theres no changes to the topbottom end that the tone knob cant fix and its fairly good in the transitions area All gain pedals can do gain but how it transitions from dirt to clean is what sets them apartthis handles it well Pluck a string and let it sit and it slowly cleans up Some pedals it slowly cleans up to a point then it just goes to blehThat said setting it with the volume all the way up and the drive all the way down and roll off a bit of the tone knob to 1100 and using the switch on LF into the front end of my Mesa Boogie Roadster on Ch3Modern pure GOLD Thats the sound Ive been looking for out of this ampSo far Ive only used it on a few of my amps and so far Ive not found it to be unusable or even as a onetrick pony Im impressed and that says a lot for someone who just a few years ago hated the idea of putting anything between his guitar and his ampif the amp couldnt do it naturally when it comes to dirty tonethen its the wrong ampI still think that way but a good pedal up front can add a nice twistand goose that front end a bit where shifting channels might not be what the Dr ordered Nice,positive
My frist guitar strap I like it alot Dose not cut in your shoulder or back Will get aother one for 2nd guitar Nice strap,positive
These Strings sell for about half the price than the store so it worth the effort and wait to order these from AmazonThe strings came very quickly and are of very good quality cheaper than the store,positive
These things are heavy duty and thick The stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things Quality devices Bomb Proof,positive
Not that its a huge deal but I quite prefer this capo over any other capo Ive used It just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that snap into placeI own several of these now and whenever I misplace one which happens too often I come back to purchase anotherIf youre looking for a capo I highly recommend using this Dunlop model The Best Feeling Capo Ive Used,positive
Works well but be careful when swivelling the display as it can easily break one of the four tabs it clips into Good tuner,positive
The adjustment screwhandle bit still works after 2 years and the base is heavy a cast metalThey look good and the paint lasts great for a performance spaceNow about the title I used one I own 2 as a sledge hammer during a band bonding event The base ended up striking the concrete patio and a chunk of the base broke off Not a issue with manufacturer but dont drop it too hard Despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use itnice and cheap Warning do not use as weapon,positive
This is a nice cable Made from good materials and is attractive I needed a 10 foot cable and Im glad I didnt buy one from the store good,positive
I put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less They fit perfect on my American Standard Stratocaster They work like a charm If you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat This are a no brainier the price is right and they look great on your stratocaster Great Locking Tuners,positive
Very well built cable and so far no hum at all Exactly what I wanted Like the retro tweed look and the sleeves that go under the TS jackets Quality product I was getting hum from some of my cheaper cables Possibly the best instrument cable I own,positive
Im happy with this Used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr old 60W Roland Cube Amp a bass player used the amp and I think it was too much for the speaker next time Ill use the PA for the bass player Much better sound perfect fit etc Keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokeytype sound I believe it has those Using this for jazz applications and having the Roland around as a second amp good speaker sounds much better,positive
I love adding channels to amps and that is exactly what this pedal does It helped me create a separate fuzzdistortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile Its built to last and solid as a rock I love the different dirt it gets combined with my MXR Carbon Copy nooned across the board Insanity I love my main rig distortion but this definitely helps add depth and doesnt tank my tone Last distortion pedal youll ever need Fuzz Factory and Beyond,positive
Does what it should and Yamaha quality The price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal I am using on a Yamaha board Just fine,positive
as another guy said 34not better not bad simply different34 its true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not likedunlophas a little bit of more wah range than behringeri do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use itmore expensive than the behringerto my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringercheaperdoes not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparentmore features than dunlopwha sound is not like the dunlops it is different but nice i personally likeso bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acousticgood deal just get it i highly recommend itthank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt awesome,positive
Bought this rosin to see how I would like it I have a very light hand on the bow so I like a rosin that is on the aggressive side This is not Since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial error Nothing special,negative
This is good cable Excellent 1434 plugs The lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material which will hold everything in place for years Grade A cable at a very affordable price Definitely going back for more The 25 ft cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft Well made audio cable,positive
A good solid case As for size its designed for the narrower Fender style body electric guitars It could have better padding for instrument protection compared to similar product from other makes Will do the job of good protection Nice Case,neutral
These bags are large I didnt realize they would hold large tripod stands My other bags were a lot smaller and sometimes the tripods would stick out the top It would have been nice if there was two pockets so two tripods wouldnt touch each other but this still works great Large Bags,positive
This is perfect No buzzes no hums no nonsense Its just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals Save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this Im so glad my friend introduced me to this product Dont pay 200 for other power supplies,positive
This pedal is remarkable for useful tones The sound may not be for everyone but i already have a Boogie for the really metal like distortion I needed something that was different but still usable and I feel this pedal fills the bill The low price tag didnt hurt my feelings either This is a winwin buying decision as far as I am concerned Danelectro D2 Fab Overdrive Effects Pedal,positive

Ive had this for several years It has worked flawlessly It has done a pretty good job with many recordings especially in the field Zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior At the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class Good product now updated,positive
what a nice clear sound it hasand smooth nice size for someone with small hands i got this because of all the good things people wrote about it in the reviews sense i always wanted to play so decided to learn and wasnt shore what kind to get so thanks for all the reviews to help me out and i am so glad i got this one it came in a nice plastic case not a cardboard box all throw i did order a case for it witch i will use when i bought this Harmonica not shore what harmonica to get on a low budget this is the oneyou wont regret it i been around blues a long time so heard many harmonicas this one truly sounds good this Harmonica is nice,positive
For 13 its hard to say anything bad about this gadget Its accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument The visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but thats a silly extra that doesnt interfere with anything so no problem Works Well Inexpensive Cant Complain,positive
like the title says ive been using these for years used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with i either use the 9s or the 10s and detune them Been using them for years,positive
Even though the title says Acoustic Guitar Case its obvious that this is a case for Astyle mandolins I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo and the reviews were good Sure enough the lining is soft and wellpadded The hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect However when closing the case a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly Just a slight pushpull motion will allow the top to snap in place then everything is as it should be The case fits my Atype mandolin perfectly and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around The slight misfit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case It serves its purpose well at a reasonable price Sturdy but slightly lessthanperfect,positive
I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good It does You have to try it to believe it I dont like the demonic face on the front though so I knocked off a star Otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars Excellent Quality Sound,positive
It has a tinney sound to it But for 200 dollars or less I would rate this has a Top of the Line low end guitarFor any beginner this is the guitar I would but in there handsI still write all my songs on this and play it more then my 000 dollar american strat or 500 dollar ibanez Great guitar for the money,positive
I am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far I get a big punch aout of it I tough I had to buy two of this but one works fine I am running a dj karaoke system I also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable item received looks diferent I say better niceeeeee,positive
Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks You simply play faster no matter what level you are Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flatpick drag Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch 24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain You pay twice as much in a store Cant use any other pick,positive
Every guitar player should own this tool instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool speeds up restring greatly,positive
I used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night I typically practice sitting down without a strap when I am alone but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band I had previously used a very expensive 2 padded leather cradle type strap which I really liked I sold that banjo and the strap with it but recently reacquired another banjo and wanted a good strap but was not willing to pay the 80 again for a premium padded leather strap I saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance I am glad I didThis strap may not be as elegant as fine leather but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction What blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo which weighs about 14 pounds literally felt half as heavy It is no joke At first the feeling was unnerving because the strap has some elastic give to it You get this dual sensation of a the banjo feeling super light and b as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor Paradoxical I know but thats where the magic of this strap is It is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you but in reality it remains very stable when playingLike I said the build quality is outstanding My only critique of the design is that it is very modern and nontraditional so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument like a 5string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strapThis is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point I think I might try these on my electrics though I already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps Excellent but takes some getting used to,positive
Colors help keep track of what is going into where And the build quality is solid I was warned about the shielding but I havent experienced an issues yet Solid build,positive
I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks They are so grippy I havent broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so its hard to loose them but I still do If you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you cant go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while youre playing They are a little thin for rhythm playing however and I recommend the 88 mm picks for that These guitar picks are great If you have a guitarist that is in your family get him a pack or 2 He will thank you,positive
I use these with Ernie Ball regular slinkies I find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles Its also cheaper Perfect,positive
This is my first slide I never use slide to play my guitar look good size is right for me I just have to learn how to use it My first slide,positive
I did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these I just got done stringing them and they sound great I think these will be what I play from now on Love them,positive
I bought this to replace another adapter that came with the Yamaha keyboard I bought at Costco long time agoThe original adapter was bulky and heavy and thats what caused the wires inside to breakTried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together but after short use the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apartWhen it is big and heavy when you unplug it sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapterBut the cable can not support the weight thus making it ripThis new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and sizeIt works beautifully the moment I plugged it inBTW I am using this NOT on the CP series It actually works for the cheaper keyboards tooMy CP33 has this identical adapter which I tested on the other cheap keyboard before I bought itIts greatAnd shipping was fast small is good,positive
I always used another companys strings and avoided Ernie Ball strings Now I dont know why After using these I am very happy with the quality and tone I get from each set Who knew,positive
I ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks They have a very comfortable feel and great sound Dunlop 41P46 46mm Light Pink Delrin Guitar Picks 12Pack,positive
Best guitar picks Great shape sturdy No fancy expensive flashy grip features Guitar pics as the Gods of Rock intended Guitar pics as the Gods of Rock intended,positive
Fantastic pedal especially considering the price Prior to this pedal Ive used an MXR Dyna Comp and a TC Electronics Nova Dynamics compressor This is lownoise compared to the MXR and simple to use It doesnt get as 34squashy34 as other compressors so dont plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output Great pedal great price,positive
I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good I do know that Ibanez uses XLs with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental designI am not loyal to any string company but I find that different companies work well on different guitars I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings so using 9 guage is new to meOriginally I went to the shop for some EB super Slinkys after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier I may buy the same strings next time but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9s so that is also an option for the future Good strings for all around use,positive
Been golding up an 88 Strat Plus that has seen better days Wiith the gold pick guard tuning pegs and jack plate it looks like a custom shop job This finished my hard work and I am delighted with the appearance The goods are up to scratch and fit properly Good service product packing and delivery time Recommend them Nice product,positive
For the money you cant beat this cable Works with the new mic my daughter got for Christmas and nice quality cord Will buy more in the future Nice,positive
Perfect to try different sizes and shapes great quality Buy it if you dont know which size or shape will work best for you pick the one u need,positive
I put it on the boom of my mic stand Tight on some not on others I need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place Worksmost of the time,positive
Ive had it on my strat for a couple of weeks now and it is holding up quite nicely Color is good and as pictured and it doesnt seem to scratch easily Installed easily Only thing that was slightly upsetting is that I only received one screw They shorted me a gold screw Luckily I had extra and this didnt bother me that much Nice Jackplate,positive
Works as described Solid little wires that allow you to be creative in how you hook up your guitar pedalsmay work other applications that require the same type of plug Solid,positive
Have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have Wish they had something for Acoustic Electric 1434 backplug They work great,positive
Great product for the priceI am using it with Win7 64bit Sonar XL ProducerI just held down the setmarker record button while plugging the usb cableI then let Windows 7 Plug Play the Drivers No Disk NeededNext I set Sonar XL Midi Control Surface device as MACKIE selected the nanoKontrol2 as the Control Midi in and outNow I have 8 channels of automation stop back record play etcI am very happy with this product so farI have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratioREAD THE INSTRUCTIONSI do not recomend downloading the KORG software if used for SONAR XLButtons and sliders and great for the priceCheers Great product for the price with Sonar XL,positive
A very nice pick both in feel and texture Only complaint is that its fairly small about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a 25 cent piece But thats okay I got this the same time as I got a set of Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III the yellowish ones and Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and I think I like the Dava picks the best All three are 34tight grip34 picks and all the same size but theyre all good These picks have a great grip though and feel dry and gritty even when theyre clean as a bone Nice Great pick with a nice tight grip excellent strumming a bit small though about as big as a nickel,positive
I bought this holder and then mounted it on a stand I built of cherry and maple for my uke It does the job It could be just a little stiffer in its adjustment but it stays where I put it so no complaints Useful device,positive
Theres nothing wrong with this stand but for the life of me I cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand Its a straight mic stand,positive
This is a very good investment Everything just sits in this case so I never have to set up any cables again All I do is setup the input from guitar to the case from the case to the amp and lets not forget the power cable It works amazing and saves plenty of time Ive also seen reviews that its VERY druable so you dont have to worry about it breaking easily I love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals such as wah or volume The only concern by some people was a slight buzzing I replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals and the sound went away I would recomment this to anyone who travels alot doesnt have a lot of space in their room or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time This item is VERY convienent Very usefulDurableVERY convienent,positive
I probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are OEM and fit perfectly Recommended I like OEM parts,positive
Good strings Five Stars,positive
This is my third purchase of this tuner All three work perfectly Very easy to tune my basses One is for my younger son who just started playing the bass The other are for me one as a backupThe reason why I gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the 9v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post I may have to tape it down to keep it in place The other two tuners dont have this issueStill its the best around Buy it Awesome tuner slight defect,positive
I primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that I can connectconvert the 35mm headphone jack into my pcThe audio adapter is well built It has a yellow LED light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a 35mm jackInstallation was flawless Windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediatelyNo issues No nonsense Simply works Works as expected good value buy,positive
Love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours Prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses Always great Kyser,positive
Ive been playing guitar for over 10 years and decided to take up ukulele as an extra little hobbyThis one is pretty decent especially at the price point Not exactly the pinnacle of quality but good enough to learn on and it comes with a case and a booklet with some basic songs and a chord chart It doesnt seem to drop tuning enough to be too bad of a nuisance but if I havent picked it up for a few days it does need some tweaking Decent starter uke,positive
I have one gig bag already not like this Fender and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar I bought This Fender is lots better then my other bag My other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this Fender bag The Finders padding is a bit better than my other bag also but of course neither is as good as hard caseI am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg I need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar because I use crutches and they require my hands The Fenders straps are great The left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all cattywompass and it became difficult for me to carry The straps on this Fender stay put love itThe guitar I tote in this bag is a Martin HD28 But it can also my Blueridge BR180 or my Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce Either of my three acoustic guitars fit the Fender gig bag perfectlyLike I said its a great gig bag If I ever need another Ill be getting another Fender gig bag Great Gig Bag,positive
Small yet sturdy enough to hold a fullsize guitar Nothing to put together just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms A very good price for an excellent product Acoustic Guitar Stand,positive
These are good quality cables at an economical price The difference between Hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable The cable shipped fast and I couldnt be more pleased Economical but Very Good Cable,positive
I am so happy with this amp Ive had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing On a couple of occasions I have plugged in my acoustic my mic and my buddies mic and it still handled the load and sounded good Im impressed I even have a Digitech pedal that I use with my Fender Strat and it sounds amazing I highly recommend this amp I love this amp,positive
I love these picks and the 88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing Great Picks,positive
it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes it does the job,positive
Needed a stand to lift my PA mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use For 20 this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation But it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height settingI took the lead from reviewer W Jones and removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical and although my amp was more stable I still didnt feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting I am using at the lowest height and it is stable but I highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is usedI give four stars for great value at 20 will suit my needs very well Rugged great for 20 but definite tipping risk,positive
This guitar just got stolen from me Frikkin thieves I loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands it is super light unlike my other gretsch guitar so easy to take anywhere it can handle some rough playing its simply awesome specially for what it costs I am SOOOOO getting another one D Hesitant Buy it,positive
I have one of these for a Lanikai tenor and one for a Stagg soprano The soprano one fits great even though its a different brand Perfect Fits great,positive
For some reason when I saw 3448 picks34 I think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks What I got was a slim resealable bag thats about 18th the size I was thinking of It comes with Light Medium and Heavy picks Even the Light picks are thicker than the 34thin34 picks I had ordered before I like having the variety though This has a variety of colors as well as the thicknessThe only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so I could maybe hang it from my strap The bag this comes in is much smaller than I thought,positive
Ive used DAddario strings for many many years without problems both acoustic electric Ive tried these coated strings in the past and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings the wrap is coated rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string like on ElixirsDo they last longer Probably Even when Im in situations where Im gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months just because I dont see the need I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you cant play regularly the strings wont corrode But these sound great and feel fine and there the least expensive coated strings Ive found Ive always found DAddario quality to be great Good strings,positive
The grip on these is pretty great I havent dropped them at all and Ive been playing so much better They give a nice crisp sound with my Elixir nanoweb strings Perfect grip,positive
Although I didnt purchase my Snark SN1 on Amazon I wanted to share my excellent customer service experience about a company that clearly cares about its customers I had a problem with my Snark and the company displayed first class customer service exceeding my expectations The SN1 is a musthave as far as Im concerned I had been using my iPhone until a friend recommended the Snark tuner SO much easier to use and I like the logical incremental LED display that shows if youre flat or sharp On my iPhone the app Ive been using doesnt always display the frequency when Im really out of tune so I have no visual indicator of where the tuning is at If I had a better ear no problem but such is not the caseSnark not only shows you with the bar display but also displays the notes your string is playing Much easier you dont need to select your tuning or anything first It picks up your frequency on whatever string youre on and you simply dial it inGreat sturdy clip with a well thoughtout foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric I usually just leave the Snark on my music stand where I can use the visual metronome You can also just clip it to a nearby desk Buy this with confidence youll love itEDIT Although I still love this little tuner my model has suffered a few issues which I will address here Im not certain if its a design flaw or not but the little plastic pieces that serve as the socket joint on both ends of the adjustable ball arm have a tendency to snap off I think the manufacturer should look into this and perhaps design a single ring of plastic which may have more integrity Also the rubber feet fell off long ago with very moderate use at my home The electronics themselves have held up admirably Excellent tuner some issues with the ball joints First class company,neutral
I put these on one of my Gibson Les Pauls and so far so good Great sound and no wear after one session unlike the DAddario stringsI will update in a few weeks as I see how long they last great strings,positive
This is a great little tuner Used it for more than a year with no issues Fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar It also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are The only reason I didnt make this a five star rating is that I discovered the Planet Waves PWCT12 NS Mini Headstock Tuner If it was a choice between the 2 the Planet Waves wins hands down But this is excellent for what it is an easytoclipon tuner that can be used on any instrument Ive even set it down on my elementary classroom autoharp and it tuned it to perfection Excellent,positive
isnt it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description The product is great value for money and worth while buying if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit They dont Dumb of them as all they needed to say was you needed to buy them separately which I later did Seems like nit picking Well its not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me Sloppy isnt it Great value but the description is vague,neutral
Theyre very thin nylon picks Theyre good for practicing the hand motions of strumming they put up very little resistance so they train you to keep your hand stable I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you dont notice with a thicker pickTheyre great for what they are thin flexible picks and Amazon has the best price Good for learning to strum,positive
Im never playing another guitar without these locksAfter my Custom Telecaster fell The neck went out of wack I had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again Thats every musicians nightmareI immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps Schaller kept coming up I looked at the design and was confident it was safe to useOne issue you may run into is the nut running loose Thats not a problem with the scaller locks it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is A drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily Great product,positive
The last thing I would think to upgrade to improve the quality of my music is the cable I did not know that these cables actually made a difference My guitar sounds cleaner when I use this cable versus another generic cable that Ive had for a while It was a pleasant surprise I also heard about the wonderful warranty that Monster has The cable has so many good things going for it I now know what to buy the next time I need one Hearing is believing,positive
Its perfect for what it does and that is to hold your amp and tilt it a bit toward the ceiling Great price great stand What more do I need to say A great stand,positive
I play with straps whenever I feel like wearing a strap and this thing is just ridiculously convenient You can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds It holds up very well also Ive had it for about a year now and have no complaints Its certainly convenient,positive

Ive had one of these for about 2 years now Ive made 100s of picks out of old credit cards gift cards club cards plastic sheets plastic packaging well you get the idea THis is fun and easy to do I have even sold the picks at garage sales 25 cents each My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock They most replicate a Fender Med pick Most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a Fender Med and Heavy THey work well also the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results The best part is I am NEVER without a pick even when people accidentally walk off with one I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back until I explain what I do with them then the clerks are like 34wow thats so cool34 On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card unless Im going for a particular part of the card with a design on it It takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards but seeing as they are basically free I dont mind 34wasting34 parts if I want a particular image Just a word of caution on things like DVDs or CDs they are really too thick and tend to shatter not worth the effort I tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of 8 punches Just an awesome tool,positive
For the price of these strings you cant go wrong However compared to Elixers the sound just isnt as 34full34 I like Elixers better,neutral
Picked up this set of cords for a gig I had at a large hotel event There were 3 audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages We had 48 channels running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board the video mix board and then the house mix board I had returns AE for my subwoofer 3 monitor mixes and a stereo main mix I used a different color cable for each function I had a second set for DI boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards All of the cables worked perfectly The video mix guy asked me where I got the cables from so he could get a set for himself These cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear downAlready had 2 sets so I ordered one more set for my studio so I can find connections that much easierGreat set of cables Excellent Quality Budget Priced,positive
Capos are a funny thing there are some that work great and many that arent so great My capos include Bird of Paridise Paige and Kyser This is a very fast and easy capo to use the tension adjustment is fast and easy If you need an all around capo for a six string guitar this is it Have tried many this is one of the best,positive
This is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand It is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly Great guitar stand,positive
Wow does this stick or what I installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this 34Power Grip mounting tape34 on the top and bottom of the pedal HOF reverb and one afternoon I stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didnt budge Had I known this before I would have installed all my pedals with this PowerGrip wonder Need sticking power This tape will definitely fill the requirement Holy moly,positive
these cable came super fast in the mail They deliver the level of performance you would expect form low cost cables they work just what you pay for,positive
I bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection Cheap but work Nothing fancyjust functional Nothing more to say but it said I needed 1 more word They work,positive
I use Daddario strings almost exclusively they make a quality product and at 3 a box shipped to my door when I buy 10 packs is a great deal Great strings,positive
This saves so much time for getting strap on and off Great design I love it Worth the money and is built well Great product,positive
this is a must have pedal for any rock player tight compressed distortion sound you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion Its build to last forever the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibilitysthe only downside is the battery get the power adapter batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace itOverall Im really happy with this pedal Wide distortion range and versatility,positive
It works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up It eats batteries like nothing this size I have ever seen The swivel ball socket broke and I had to glue the arm into the remaining socket Hmmm Eats batteries,neutral
This strap is sturdy and looks good and goes well with a Fender Strat it doesnt come off every time you get to jamming out and forget you are not sitting down so you dont have to worry about dropping your guitar so you can focus on rocking out Great strap,positive
This Capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price There are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar It does not break and is very sturdy Highly recommended WORKS GREAT,positive
Fulfils its intended purposeHolds several picksnonmarring adhesive on back wont damage guitar finishesEasy to withdraw and replace picks Holds picks,positive
Ive had this pedal since the mid90s when I started playing in my teens While an EQ might seem like an odd choice for a beginners pedal selection I was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and midrange of the cheap CRATE and Marshall amps I used back then Since I have better equipment now I havent used it as muchHowever as simple as it is it is definitely a useful tool You can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs Or you can the onboard volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder partsThe only negatives I recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise but not so much that you couldnt trap it with a noise gate and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit Again nothing that cant be fixed with other effects And if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as wellI give it 5 despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and BOSS products are built rock solid Ill have this thing forever Great EQ can be used as a level booster,positive
This stand folds into a pretty small package but supports the guitar very solidly You would almost have to INTENTIONALLY knock it over I dont think a casual bump would do it The only complaint I would have is that the guitar leans back a bit far My other stands are pretty standard with a vertical riser to support the neck and Im used to a more upright stance Maybe thats just a matter of taste but otherwise this is a great stand Does the job,positive
I was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasnt recognized and I sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel Now its working Used it on my printer cartridge,positive
This recorder is okay but its far from perfect No I didnt expect it to be perfect but still I refuse to give it more than 3 stars It seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely However other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible I use this to practice with a band and then Ill just listen to the arrangement later so I can practice by myself For this much I have no complaints Besides that I would never use this if I wanted a decent quality recording of anything Good but not great,neutral
When I tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent Noting that this product comes from China the first thing I suspected was cold solder joints I warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and YES not only were there cold solder joints but there was a small piece of loose wire shorting components at random Typical of quality control in the Peoples Republic of China A little touchup with the soldering iron and its back to normal whatever that is Im a bit disappointed with the octave but Im keeping it because its a good fuzz and I voided the warranty The NormalMidCut switch is part of why its a great fuzzI think Ill replace the Fuzz control with a pot that provides a wider range before going into supersaturation but the rest of the controls Ill leave aloneDislikes quality of Chinese products is a crap shootLikes its a good affordable effect Great effect after a little touchup,positive
I purchased this model for home usenot for a kids backpack Its solid and sturdy easily holding a song book opennot just a few pieces of sheet music It adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening I often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down Works for me Solid,positive
These are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar I would rather concentrate on making music Why fight your guitar I was looking for a lighter option for my acoustics,positive
Since they were named 34Gator Grip34 I expected them to have a good gripping surface That was not the case The entire material and holding surface is the same material Also they werent as large as I expected They are still usable as decent picks Gator Grip,neutral
This straplock set doesnt come with any instructions thats because its so easy you dont need them Took the original screws off my Fender Strat set the button screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in Afterwards screwed the lock into myGibson Lightning Bolt Style 2 Inch Safety Guitar Strap Jet Blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was readyIt is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock wont come loose by accident by any chance Still havent given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes I can tell I made the right purchase Way recommended Installed them last night,positive
They are good quality guitar picks and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for some guitar picks Awesome,positive
This bridge is heavily constructed so the amplified sound is much more vibrant and alive It must weigh twice as much as the bridge from my old Indiana Custom SType Guitar Im glad I replaced it Now I have a lot more guitar for my money I probably spent 200 total on my Fender bridge assembly locking tuners and TexMex pickups as well as the original 59 for my used guitar and I would say I now have the functional equivalent of a 500 Fender Stratocaster based on sound quality and ease of fingering This was time and money well spent A must have item to upgrade a guitar with,positive
It works pretty well on my ukulele however it left several dents and scratches on the tuners of my ukulele It works on my ukulele,positive
Im not a big fan of pedals at all I much prefer multi effects but that being say this is a great cheap pedal Does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack These really are great cheap pedals,positive
As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the Gibson ES335 clones wont fit Epiphone guitars as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock This case however fits my Dot Custom like a glove The padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level Nice case,positive
Just got this stand todayFirst impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impressionIt seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crapThe base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling overThe telescope mechanism is quite well madeComes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adaptersI got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall Its quite the perfect height for when Im seated on my stoolOne thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved Maybe adding something to keep it screwed inWould recommend to othersProbably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs good buy for the buck,positive
I like this cleaner its gentle on my guitar finish and it doesnt smell bad either Cleans Well and Leaves No Residue,positive
After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 1934 or more I decided to play it safe with a couple of 1334 gooseneck this way if a longer unit is needed I can just screw 2 together This is an excellent piece of hardware very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front using an SM 57 and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely stillGreat buy Excellent sturdy gooseneck,positive
This is a very good quality nice sounding delay You can get that classic slapback sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound Very simple to operate and thats what makes these Joyo pedals a joy to use Nothing fancy but simple and to the point Another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass I have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise They say that they are true bypass but they are not These babies are dead quiet I run mine through the effects loop on my Bugera V22 tube amp and it sounds great I also own the Joyo Vintage OD TubeScreamer clone and it is great as well Highly recommend You Cant Go Wrong With Joyo,positive
I like them but I love the Schaller locks more They dont feel as secure as the Schaller locks Sorry They work but I prefer the Schallers,neutral
Does what it says it will do and it does it very well The connector is a 38in female slot so make sure whatever it is youre buying can connect to that The micboom stand I bought and the on desk stand were both 58in male so I had to buy 2 cheap adapters 6 each I also am having some issues really locking in the AudioTechnica condenser mic to the shock mount So far it stays in but isnt super secure wobbles just a little if its moved but maybe Im just doing it wrong Aside from that though great product Very Nice Product,positive
Ive been playing guitar for over 40 years and these Tortex picks are nearly the worst Iv ever used They are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackityclack noise Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better Not the Worst but Close,negative
Behringer makes quality products I purchased the excellent C1 Condenser Microphone and replaced the 302usb with the Xenyx 802 mixer boardWhen I researched items for a simple home recording setup I saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer and read the item description here on Amazon and the Behringer website for the C1 mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the Behringer phantompowered mixer boardsThat was incorrect information this board receives power only via USB and doesnt provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics 48vWhen I setup the return of this board to Amazon I informed of the error and the appear to have acted very promptly on it as the item description for the C1 on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for 48 voltsAlthough this correction is good it would be more helpful to customers if Behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately powerIve noticed in other venues ie musician and sound forums Behringer gets a bad rap I dont think its due to poor quality equipment I think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale Neither the Behringer website nor the included documentation with the items I bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts Quality board misleading description from manufacturer,neutral
Its a great pick holder but Im not fond of the sticky background Something clipon would have been more useful Pick holder,neutral
Other picks usually let me down when I riff and melt faces playing the blues jazz or gospel etc Fender heavies are made to make the notes sound like l they have been hit for real I prefer no cheap imitations Only Fender Heavies Thats what I smoke Fender HeaviesThats What I Smoke,positive
For being so cheap this pickup works surprisingly great Was just looking for something quick and easy to mic a violin at a decent quality and this did the job perfectly Cheap quick and easy pickup for violin works great,positive
I had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply This rosin is great because its encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin Its so easy to apply and doesnt leave any messy residue on my fingers I havent been playing the violin for very long but did know I needed something to rosin the bow easily This was exactly what I needed Easy To Use,positive
Overall I like this winder Its handy having the wire cutter built into it But when I am winding new strings it often slips off Since I am using one hand to hold tension on the new string I would prefer this to hold on more securely so I dont have to put it back on several times But all in all its a lot better than winding by hand and it seems sturdy Does the job but sometimes slips off when turning,positive
Great as a booster as others have said For solos itll boost your mids and your signal As an overdrive its great kind of a midsy Marshally sound It does suck out some of the low end but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever Its a Boss its solid and a great price Remember this is overdrive not distortion For distortion look at other Boss pedals For a boost and more,positive
Only issue they break easily But they last a long time and sound great Well worth the money Crisp and fresh tone for a long time Great Bright Tone,positive
Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle A great investment thatll last quite a long time Works great,positive
Great universal power supply for your pedals and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome I have two of these that I mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with and you wont get any noise interference with its isolated outputs Perfect power supply for your pedals,positive
I am just learning how to play the mandolin one of the problems I was having was supporting the mandolin and fretting the notes since I got this strap adjusted I no longer have to hold the neck so I can concentrate on the notes I like the fact that you can unclip the strap at either end without touching the adjustments so I can put it into my case without having the strap laying across the neck yet pick it up and with one click it is ready to play Nice strap,positive
Yeah I kind of bought it on a whim its confusing as hell first of all I dont really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described Pretty good but CONFUSING,positive
How you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar youre using it on What works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another I can say with confidence that this capo works flawlessly on an American Standard Strat Fits great easy onoff easy adjustments The padding on the capo is such that you would really have to go out of your way to mar the finish on your neck with it All relevant areas of the capo are well padded It seems very well constructed after two weeks of heavy use I dont see why it wouldnt last for years Perfect on a Stratocaster,positive
Still a great product its just a little flimsy The way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem It doesnt attach It just slides in and then you kinda just hope it doesnt bend or break The only problem is if you are clumsy like me you might push your guitar down into it a little to hard and damage it A little flimsy,positive
This is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars I tried this untreated MicrofiberPolish Cloth on my Gibson ES339 because I had heard good things about itWell begin with some stats the cloth is 1134 by 1134 and has an 18 border stitched aroundthe edge It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea There is a small warning on theback of the package that states Not designed for cleaning electrical devices You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water rinse it out and hang it up to dry Now to thereviewMy guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the bodys front and back and BACKof the neck I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finishWhat I discovered about this cloth even with increased elbow grease is that it has its limitationsSo if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out If the body oils have been there for awhile probably collecting dust then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply itI decided to use Dunlops Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish Cleaner to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behindYou want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finishThe fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitarSo like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort My highexpectations based upon the blurb were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared messNonetheless I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing Very Good For Upkeep Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth Photos lt NOT PreTreated Grey,positive
Bought as a gift for my son and hes very pleased with it What can you say Its a guitar strap it does the job and looks good And 20 for a Levys Leather strap is a good deal I got the gold and its goodlooking without being garish Good functional strap,positive
Dang thats metal Were the first words I said when plugging this thing in to the line With a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome The only issue was with some manufacturing detail The input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time The buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time I used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is Be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less Razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal Dang thats Metal,positive
I was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and im glad with HOSA quality It feels reliable and without adding noise Very good quality for an excellent price,positive
it is a hardshell case about what I expected decent low end hardshell but serviceable I wouldnt check in with an airline I can lean on the top and push it in for a little extra protection over a gig bag YES dont put an amp on top of it in a van though Not Airline baggage,positive
Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types its a great capo and very durable in construction and material Like a good guitar that is well cared for this is something thats great to hand down to the next generationPlease click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help One of the best capo,positive
I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool its complicated which for a capo is saying something The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in useBottom line If you dont mind the extra effort and dont plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using then maybe you will enjoy it For everyone else look elsewhere Looks cool and practical but is a total pain,negative
Its easy to set up and use Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it I re soak it easy 23 weeks or so Cant tell if its truly working on my maple wood ukulele I use it in my ukulele case,positive
Works well for a multitool personally you could get away with a little crank winder and a wire cutter but this is nice to have in your bag just in case And for the price you really cant beat it 3 tools in one handy spot Solid,positive
What can you say about a Foam Ball type mic windscreen Well it fits the RODE M1 Mic I was using nice and tight Quality is good didnt tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine Nice quality and fits my RODE Mic just fine,positive
I bought a couple to replace some of my old rusty chrome stands and was skeptical at first I have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical Have bought several more GREAT STAND,positive
I replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it oncenormally after tuning new strings for the first time I break them in by rigorously bending them using the whammy bar and tugging on them then I retune them I rinse and repeat until the tuning stays not with these strings tuned them once no breaking init sounds amazing on clean on its own without any effects and the natural sustain is great they also sound good with any settings I usei bought two sets first time using these strings surpassed my expectations,positive
I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap Way too small maybe like a third of the width I just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit However it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or somethingUPDATEWhen attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap it stays on pretty snugly But you need to attach it with something Not big enough for normal straps,neutral
It is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noiseI used it for several years but it is only a backup now Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning although probably would not be used by most musicians Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner I would not recommend it not my best choice,negative
A couple of my friends and I own this pickup and use it to amplify our acoustic guitars through a mixer and loudspeaker system Works really well considering how inexpensive it is Its very easy to install and remove but be sure you have a fairly standardsized sound hole in your guitar to ensure that it will fit and be reasonably stable Great value,positive
I needed a new bass strap because my old one was frying at the ends I choose this one because it was very durable The nylon is very strong I do not see it fraying in the future The leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs The guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand Good colour selection too Highly recommended Basic durable,positive
I got two of these but wish I had got better ones Using them on the Black thinline and the Washburn classical Ok,neutral
DAddarios are my go to strings for my Washburn and Ibanez acoustics They sustain well great tone tune well and last for a good while between changes Cant find anything bad about these strings,positive

These cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the USA I had one just like this with the Neutrik connectors gave away as gift and now have two with the GH Show Saver connector option This makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the priceThese cables are wellbalanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass They are wellshielded look nice and handle wellYou could pay more for gold plating for slightly better corrosion resistance or for woven coverings to make the wire look cute if you want to No compromises excellent cable,positive
I use this for my iPad I drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit Its solid and works great very adjustable Good seller to iPad holder,positive

I have a Taylor GA4E The elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright I tried some martins ej16s which I love on my Seagull S6 However those strings just didnt have enough bass and too much highs I bought these recently and I love them They are much better then the original strings Very rich bass that really comes out The highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright My one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me Anyway the best sounding strings with the setup I have Now off to buy some different bridge materialsEDIT 92212I also put these on my Seagull Mini jumbo and wow Every time I come back to it after several weeks I forget that I put the 600Ls on it Then I pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are John Pearse strings Worth every penny Very nice,positive
strings I use DAddario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great They have a really nice sound and dont cost an arm and a leg Great,neutral
Theres nothing complicated about this purchase Its a cable It works It doesnt cost a lot Its a great deal Get itI use it every week and it still sounds perfect Then again I never mistreat my equipment Great deal for the money I paid,positive
Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice This device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy Why you would almost think I know what I am doing Great item,positive
As some of the other reviews state you barely need any type of guitar cleaner when using these microfiber cloths Ive found for the best results use a wax sealant product and then use this cloth separately and afterward to clean your guitar The fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly Amazing How Well These Work,positive
Wonderful tuner Ive used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all Incredibly easy to use super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go Well worth the price Easy to use,positive
It sorta cleans strings but not fully i dont even really use it anymore i feel like i wasted my money on this item kinda usless to me,neutral

These days on my pedal board I have several MXR Micro pedalsThey have slowly earned their way on the board and eventually pushed some expensive boutique pedals into early retirementThe MXR Mirco Chorus is a perfect One Trick Pony it does one thing beautifully and simply and that one thing is create a soft velvety chorus effect with good chime tones when I activate the MXR Custom Comp pedal in conjunction with the MXR Micro Chorus I can easily copy the Andy Summers Police sound and a few other notable chorus stylesNoteIt works great with distortion and with clean compressionI never have to bend over and adjust a bunch of NOBS in the dark simply control the one speed NOB with my foot on the fly quite simplyPresently I use these MXR productsThe MXR Custom Comp I highly recommend this very subtle very professional compression pedal read any review of this pedal youll see whyThe MXR Micro Flanger Easy sounds amazing never have to bend over and fiddle with it does Jet airplane to subtle wavesThe MXR Micro Chours Easy soft sounding with good chime never have to bend over and fiddle with it simple foot controlAnd the old standard Ive had this since the 1980s the MXR Phase 45 simply the best phase pedal ever made and Ive tried them all Another great MXR Micro pedal,positive
I collect picks or plectrums if youre a purist and I do so for a good reason I dont use the same pick for the same sort of playing style I tend to use some picks for jazz some for blues some for metal and so on Not all picks are made the same some are far better than othersThe Dava Master Control Pick DMCP is a very nice useful pick Ive been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin I like its thin center and the way it is overall contoured which makes holding it a delight to my forefinger thumbAnother thing I really like about it is the metal tip which some folks may not enjoy as it does give a bit of a metallic tone when it touches the strings This is especially true when youve just replaced your old guitars strings for new ones Depends on how you like it or not whether you like that metallic ting I do for certain passagesThe picks construction seems to be fairly rigid yet it has potential to do more than merely chug again on the low E A strings DMCP is definitely a plectrum that I will be using a lot of in the future and not just for hard core metal but also for subtle tones in jazz passages with the distortion offOverall I give the DMCP 5 out of 5 stars for being what it claimed it was and for being something that I will find great utility for in years to come NICE Pick for Stringed Instruments,positive
This thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning It has many features I have yet to utilize but good to know they are there if needed Precise tuning tool,positive
I am revising my previous review on the 3250LsI have now only had these on my American Stratocaster for two weeks I loved them so much at first that I ordered 5 other sets and restrung several of my other Strats and other guitarsBIG mistake Why am I so impatientThese were unbelievable right out of the box bring my Strat to life giving it an unbelievable feel and soundBut with every positive theres usually a negativeand wait for itwait for ityup there wasI changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my Strat and noticed all three smaller strings GB E were all flat on the fret side They were already worn out I suspected something as the sound had changed already too becoming flat after only about a weekThis is NOT mu only guitar I now have 17 total and rotate playing so I bet I hadnt played the Strat for more than6 hours or soNow Im so disappointed Im going to step up to the 250s then the 150 if I have to I love the sound but dont want to change strings every weekTo make a long story short I wouldnt buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings NICE for a short time,neutral

I was looking for a portable foldup stand that I could take to gigs and searched around Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for 10 how could I go wrong Oops Wrong The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesnt blow This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you dont care too much about but for for an electric guitar or bass no wayI just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support Live and learn Simple sturdyportable and useless for electric guitars or basses,negative
I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars Does what it says it will do keeps your strap locked on I have had zero issues with these The installation takes 2 minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play Highly recommended Sturdy and easy to install,positive
Bought to tune my bass Works fine and at the this price it cant be beat Highly recommend for budget tuner Korg GA40 Large Display Guitar and Bass Tuner,positive
the only strings I get are Ernie Ball strings Really reliable great sound got no complaints here really Ernie Ball knows how to do strings strings,positive
I love DAdarrio strings Great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers DAdarrio strings rule See ya DAdarrio EXL1403D Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings Light TopHeavy Bottom,positive
I love this tuner I feel its more accurate that the old one I have that was given to me I will always buy Snark tuners They are very sensitive so I feel that my instrument is in truer tune Best tuner for my Ukulele,positive
Dont panic strings marked ADFB CAN be used just fine for GCEA tuning They dont seem to be quite as nice as the comparable Aquilas but theyre half the price They were for a 20 uke And yeah new 4 strings do improve the sound on a 20 uke Dont Panic,positive
everything on a fender should be fender parts these hold as good as dunlops and are easier to get off with sweaty fingers these give me more comfort because they are locked on solid and requires a push then pull to come off I get furious when my guitar comes off the strap so this stopped it and kept the fender mojo going for the fender dude,positive
Bought this strap for use with my Dean EVO electric Its very nice and durable though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavyduty It works great though and for the price its wonderful Nice strap,positive
Well its not really too expensive but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it Even the crunch button is just a louder sound Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound youre looking for Guess thats why its so cheap Cant Dunlop come up with a better descriptive word then b,negative
I chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons It is lovely Clear shard silk screening The capo itself is really good It is very snug on the strings Beautiful piece,positive
I have a strat running into a crate amp with a tub preamp and it picked up noise like mad this pedal is like an automatic volume knob that turns down the input if there isnt a signal from the guitar takes a little playing with it to get it dialed in but now I just keep it on all of the time does the job,positive
I love the sound of this pedal Its as versatile as can be If you want to sound like 5 Dimebag Darrels then dont buy this pedal If you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you I employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortionsoverdrives I have noticed the on off light is intermittent but the pedal still effects the signal either way For a pedal that I have stomped on so many times Im not even the least bit concerned For an inexpensive unit this thing rules My most active guitar pedal,positive
Thanks for the prompt and good service These are a quality product and really enhance my Guitar and I am very happy with them Thanks Great Product,positive
Nice and thick the adhesive is very strong I have used it on microphone electronics to shield out RF noise If you dont have the shielding grounded or in a continuous loop it wont work If you hear hum its not the shielding its your technique What can you say its copper shielding,positive
Great great great great great great great great great Been uning them for years Love the sound and playability and durability matin coated are good too Great,positive
Dont expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you wont be disappointed That said I find it useful for composing on the road Heck it even sounds better than my big guitars in an odd way for certain songs Nice sturdy and portable case Not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask Action is adequate for practicewith a little tweaking its actually good Quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors Good travel companion,positive
Its a pop filter In case one wasnt good enough they double it up Works great No complaints whatsoever No need for a fancy pansy 50 metal mesh screen This works just as good Hey it works,positive
Works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg Quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence Great price too Good stand and a good price,positive
Great value Works well tunes tight and is CHEAP When the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works What more is there to say Great for the price,positive
The gauges are identical to Ernie Ball Regulars yellow label but the DAddarios string tension feels stiffer which is nice for slide playing I like my action mediumlow comfortable for straight playing and bending solid intonation for chords yet not too much fret rattle for slideI usually stretch the heck out of Ernie Balls after putting them on because they have so much spring in them I deliberately left the DAddarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all Their new sound is quite bright as advertised but has far less of what I call new string jangle which is fine by me As a kid Id sweat that off in an hour but these days playing a number of instruments it can last awhileTheres a string tension chart handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number Ill admit Id never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting but apparently thats the case and DAddario provides a web site lookup to verify your set If you do come across fakes if youre willing to report it theyll provide you with a genuine replacement for freeIve used DAddario phosphorbronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over 25 years and swear by their quality and consistency Ive used Ernie Balls on electrics for even longer Habits can be tough to break but as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots I find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings Finally nailing a sound and feel youve been chasing after for years makes it all worth it A Little Tighter Than Ernie Balls,positive
in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 NYLON clear stringsnow tis almost impossiblewith these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetarone will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble stringsvery nice resonant and cleannot shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont knowAgain like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUSsound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTICThis makes the move from the D to the G string too noticableCANT THEY EVEN MAKE 6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totallysucks bad nowoohthanks man BIPOLAR GTR Syndrome half nylon sound half something else totally,negative
This is a great effect Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products has always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable This CAE boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations You will not be dissappointed at all Ships fast Highly recommended Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR Boost Line Driver Great effect,positive
I really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money It securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it Very stable base The bottom which holds the guitar can be switched over for different size bases of guitars A good price a good buy Glad I invested in it By the way I read several reviews which said this had a smell to itMine does not I just wonder what other people have encountered Nice presentation stable and good value,positive
I own aTaylor Guitars 355CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use They are great strings on any guitar Bright tone long lasting great strings,positive
This is simply the best power supply out there Everything is so quiet with no humpowered perfectly Although I dont use all the options such as the SAG option and different voltage options etc its great to have them available to me Id LOVE two more portsbut I guess you cant have it all Yes,positive
works as advertised good construction folds easy holds acoustic or electric does not nock over easy or at all good product works gr4eat,positive
Well made XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job Recommend,positive
I use this clamped to a table and its a superb product I have a 734 tablet and a 9734 Touchpad and they both work very well in it Nice mount Great value Buy it Phenomenal very heavy duty VERY heavy duty tablet clamp,positive
I hooked this up to the output of my Mackie mixing desk I have my powered monitors via a Y cable on one output and my headphones on anotherI can now play my guitar write record etc through the speakers or the headphones and very quickly switch between them without messing about with cables and whatnotBecause my headphones are closed DJ type they cut out a lot of background noise and I previously found myself wondering are the speakers off It was particularly awkward in that the power switches for my speakers is on the back Not handyNow Ive installed this headphone amp its definitely become an integral part of my setup and definitely worth the money Now I can actually get on with the music Another excellent Behringer purchase Recommended without hesitation Indispensable,positive
If you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track these will not help much That being said these are not junk nor are they cheap nasty instruments there are plenty available that are much worse than these Straight from the case these dont bend well but do not despair Having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days about eight hours of playing So far I have persuaded the G A Bb and C to bend enough to satisfy curiosity but they will not hold up to serious playing I do not destroy my harps easily so am not the most aggressive player out there but I felt like these would certainly be something even I may wear out pretty quickly For the purpose I intended these to perform they are about perfect with me breaking them in I can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics Better use these inexpensive harps to overblow and squawk through than the set I will be buying in six months if the promise of musical ability follows through The advantage of the plastic comb is that I dont need to pass on any germs with them they wash very easily with no damage For the price you get seven good harps that make presentable learner instruments with just a little prep Without the experienced blues player to break them in it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them there are many YouTube videos that will teach the method so try hard persevere and you will crack it with these harps try learning bending on the lower key instruments first they will be easier NOT a professional instrument,positive
a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item i bough for my primo and he really loves it very nice and cool,positive
Great use to hold a guitar pick and to use to find your keys to open the door withMy son likes it and uses it often Works great,positive
prettyseems to work finepurchased a pack for my playing buddyhe loves fenderonly way to gowill order another set soon very happy with service nice not much else to say,positive
My son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in Europe during WW I Needless to say I did not want to pass this on to him yet I figured he could start simpler I read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument It has a great tone Its construction is solid I am sure this will give him years of entertainment This is not a toy a great addition to your mouth harp collection A great purchase,positive
ProsPrice pointcant really go wrongClean signal no selfnoiseWorks for a tunerConsFor recording or amplification purposes this thing picks up a LOT of attack noisefingers dropping on the strings bow clicks etcAdditionally the clamp does not always solidly grasp the instrument and shakes around a bit God help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified Meh,neutral
My mother has a habit of stealing my picks so I always order from them They always give me good picks to use This picks are good,positive
What can I sayfor the price this is the best tuner out there right now So nice not having to step on a tuning pedal in order to tune while Im gigging onstage I just cut the volume on my guitar Snark senses vibrations through the neckso no sound needed and Im doneTap tempo works great too if you need to know the tempo of a song Just another awesome bonus Snark works awesome,positive
This is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described Suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather and 2 inches is fairly narrow If this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect If you prefer the strap slip easily or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more then it wont beDefinitely top notch if this is what you are after though 5stars Fine Quality,positive
OK it was cheap nine bucks at the time the design looked good and sensible and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need I bought it without hesitation HOWEVER once hooked up I was very surprised how flimsy it is I have a 13 gooseneck a light condenser mic and small shockmount on it At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand Obviously any small bump into the stand will once again set this off Using it at home Ive gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful but obviously this unit is far from ideal Since then Ive gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand and though I havent really put through its paces yet this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable AND only costs a few bucks more On Stage MSA9508 PosiLok Sidemount Boom For anyone considering this product I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 PosiLok Sidemount Boom You will be far far happierCheers Good Idea Really Bad Execution better unit for a few s more,negative
I really like the onehanded operation and I really do prefer that the access to it is behind the fret board instead of out front That makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy onoff Ive been a Jim Dunlop fan for more than 40 years and this product just reinforces that Its just right for me,positive
These picks are a good change of pace They are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers Good investment for the price Easy to grip and feels good,positive
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller1 Bulky They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below2 Problems engaging I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out It wasnt until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go3 Cheap They just feel cheap Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers which have a very heavy and solid feel to themFor a few bucks more Ill stick with Schallers I have been using them for 10 years and have never seen one fail Not as good as Schallers,negative
for any sound techs that like to make things simple and easy to workthese XLR jumper cables are the way to go and the quality is impressive I used them for a new set of wireless mike to jump into my 16 channel board and was it so easy my mikes are color coded and my cable fitted right in with the same color code thus making it easy to identify from afar and easy to control on the mixing board audio soundman helper,positive
Is a good stand Relatively small but is a secure The locking top is a good feature as well Id recommend this over the larger tubular type Decent stand,positive
I order this for my Glen Burton cutaway I had it in a gig bag but acoustic guitars shouldnt be in a gig bag I got tired of my guiitar being banged around in the back of the car so I ordered this hardshell case It is wonderful Very well made and beautiful It came to me right on time with no problems at all It also has a lock on it so you can lock your guitar up so no one will get in to it It is a little heavy but that is something I can get use to My guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug I love this case and it is worth every dime you pay for it maybe even more Wonderful Case,positive
You want a Fender to sound like one and using these strings helps with that I have them on a MIA Telecaster and they stay in tune and have good sustain Im happy with them Fender guitar strings,positive
I JUST RECEIVED MY 10 PACK PLANET WAVES BEATLE COLLECTORS PICK GRAPHICS ARE GREAT ITS A GREAT LITTLE COLLECTION ONLY THING THAT I DIDNT LIKE WAS THAT YOU DIDNT GET 15 SEPARATE ONES THEY ARE ALL DUPLICATES SO BESIDES THAT THEY ARE GREAT BEATLE PICKS,positive
Purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home The cable is great because its long enough to allow us to move our mic where we need it I got this item much quicker than I expected The shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition Seller is A in my book If we need more of this type of equipment would certainly buy from them again Great Product Great Service,positive
TUSQ saddles and nuts are the best synthetic out there All my stringed instruments have been fitted with TUSQ parts The gold standard,positive
I bought this to replace a Behringer UCA202 The Behringer performs very well for my use guitar in a home studio but recently its become way too sensitive to interference I was getting noise from the nearby cable modem router network drives This noise was making its way to my recordings too For what ended up being less than twice the price of the Behringer I decided to try this unit Not only is it interferencefree it has a much warmer intimate soundIts USB powered installs automatically in about a minute under Win7 with no issues I did go to the Lexicon website and get their driver though just to be on the safe sideREAPER had new entries for the device in the audio settings panel ASIO Everything just works great first time I was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zerolatency monitoring on the device Great unit I love the Behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail Excellent Unit,positive
Bought these as an extra set just in case I made a mistake when I was trying to cut down my nut and bridge They are real bone and fit well on my Yamaha Did not end up using them but will one day Great product for the price Fantastic Buy,positive
I primarily play live and I am a toneoholic In other words I use high end pedals cables amps and pickups and try to keep as little as possibel between my guitar and amp I bought a couple of these so I could have one on both my main and backup guitar No more need for a pedal based tuner These work that well and are almost undetectable from the front They also wont mark up your prized instrument This replaced my pedal based tuner,positive
I purchased the DR40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs and it accomplishes that very well The battery life is great the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it and the build quality is pretty solid My only issue is the internal mics while crystal clear in terms of quality can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things In addition they are VERY susceptible to wind even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air I highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery Purchased for amateur field recordings,positive
One end was loose so I tightened it it keeps coming loose so I had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads hope I dont ever have to open the end for repair Good for the Price,neutral
This delay pedal was so cheap that I could not pass it up and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use I stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar I actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica but those were dismal failures Big win for the guitar though Great for the Money,positive
Im a HUGE fan of the two previous NS Capos from Planet Waves What does this add to the othersWell functionally I think it works no better than the previous dual action capo In other words Its freakin perfectSo Id give it 4 stars except it gets 5 becauseThat little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute geniusFull marks You cant miss with this product A great product made even greater,positive
works great and looks great low price so overall i would recommend it to anyone that needs a soft case awesome bag great price,positive
I have a Fender Hod Rod Deluxe and though its got the Formel Electronics Mod still needed a nice touchThis guy filled the need Using the Effects Loop no need of Volume or Gain the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful Ideal for Tube Amps,positive
This is thus far a good bargain I have used it to hang a 12 heavy string The arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt No chance of falling There are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal Works well for the price,positive
I needed a 9volt adapter to use with an Danelectro N10B Honey Tone Mini Amp This was recommended and I am happy with the product Needed,positive
I tried it for iPad It kinda wobbles up and down It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad I only recommend it for something light weight Theres better ones out there See my review on the music stand That comes with a solid extension arm Good for light weight stuff,negative
This is not a pick for windmilling guitarists This is a pick for the precision player Its really smallnoticeably smaller than the red Jazz III picks With large fingers like mine it almost disappears But the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it Its a very stiff pick with just enough give to keep from sawing your strings offThe picks are firstrate Based on my previous experience with Dunlop picks this 6pack will last me for years Im inclined to lose a few along the way just so I can give Dunlop some repeat business Tiny precision pick,positive
I have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele I cant imagine life without this pick holder before I was always losing picks and then I had to strum with my fingers which I dont like doing Get one of these if you play with a pick What are you doing just buy it,positive
These are the standard in guitar strings they are well made play nicely and are the size that most guitars come with from the factoryDo they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with Are they handwound Are they made with exotic materials No to all the above These are a high quality nofrills set that is acceptable to everyone from beginners to the most accomplished professionalThese days they make everything from coated strings of various colors to pure nickel to pure stainless steel in almost every mix and match gauge imaginable If you arent a beginning guitarist you probably arent reading this review because youve already played a set of these You are off playing different brands and tech just to fine tune things maybe trying out the latest coating or maybe just deciding that pure nickels have that vintage vibe youre going forBut if you just need to know if Ernie Ball strings are any good they are The bigger question for beginners is do I keep the gauge that came on my instrument these for Gisbsons Super Slinkys pink package for Fenders as a rule of thumb or do I try something newIn summary for me these are the safe pick the strings that I know will work when I just need a good set of strings at a great price You really cant go wrong with a set of these THE Standard,positive
Super Excellent for dimly lighted roomsserves its purpose really well and I plan to keep one of these handy from now on Thanks for good quality products at a fair price PerfectwellNearly Perfect,positive
This instrument might actually be in a class of its own That is it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality not only with regard to craftsmanship but certainly the sound it produces The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged amplified or even run directly through a mixer Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollowbodied instrument on the market due to its components and design The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible or playable to even the most novice of musicians This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician simply because it is cost efficient durable and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument An Unbeatable Value,positive
I was not sure about this at first Seemed too cheap to work But I was happily surprised It works welllNot perfect but not expensiveGet one very good tune not much,positive
The Chorus is subtle but it seems lacking to me It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have Not enough umph,negative
This product is a must Why because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliableand when the strap is clipped into place it is secure Ive owned numerous Straplok systems on the various bass guitars Ive owned and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system Want security and convenience This is it for guitar strap usage,positive
Like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you highly recommend to everyone who play guitar Nice,positive
You may have experienced the problems of musicians The drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late But you need to rehearse This gets the job done you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want The thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack Otherwise easy and a great product The best is that if you are playing really poor lead work nobody can hear but you lol Surprisingly useful,positive
This worked out of the box I have two XLR misc one keyboard and a guitar connected and its very easy to balance the levels There is no noise or other problem so farGreat for my familylooking to buy more soon great product great price,positive
First saw on YouTube video how genius A pick that stays in hand Makes me wonder how ever played without themSmall price for big help Where have these been all my life,positive
I have always trusted the Graph Tech TUSQ products and this is no different The compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed Quality Product,positive
This Snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use even for my children and works well The display is easy to understand and is very accurate confirmed by our guitar teachers meter The Snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finishEverything should be this easy to use and work this wellHighly RecommendedCFH Works Well Easy To Use Highly Recommended,positive
I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neckI found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th Both are very good I did notice that if I had a wider neck I think i am 425 mm at the nut on my two Takamines the may be a bit short They work and are cool looking I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great Cheaper ones also work A little pricey but very well made,positive
I bought this amp for practicing my bass at home I really liked the sound It was crisp and clear just like I expected from an AmpegIt looked great and felt solidThen after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case The rattle just got worse louder as I played It was very annoying I didnt feel comfortable opening up a new amp and trying to trouble shoot it myself I had visions of voiding the warranty and being stuck with an amp I couldnt playI was sad returning the Ampeg great sound for the price but I was soured on Ampeg perhaps unfairly from a sample of 1 I replaced it with a Fender Bronco which has an Ampeg emulation setting so my bass world is back in balanceAdmittedly since the Fender Bronco was more than twice as expensive as the Ampeg I have thought that I could have just taken the money I spent on the Fender Bronco and bought a more expensive Ampeg on the guess that a more expensive Ampeg would have a better design or materials or quality control But a guess is just a guess and I didnt want to test that guess by throwing more money at Ampeg so the Fender Bronco got my moneyMy rating of 3 stars is an average of 5 stars for quality of sound and a 1 star for quality of production Great sound with an anoying rattle after two weeks,neutral
Decent stand as long as you arent abusing it With any discount item a few shortcuts were taken to keep the price in line I dont plan on moving it so it works for me Good cymbal stand for the money,positive
Liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as I must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes I bought another for my step son I did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after reseating the battery it has not had a problem since great little tuner,positive
I have never been much of a fan for coated strings I normally use DAddario EJ 16s but I do like these Elixirs after about 4 weeks of playing they are starting to fade not stay in tune and I notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole They do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround Elixir nanoweb light PB strings,positive
Used this to dress up the Saga tele kit I bought on Amazon It fit perfect and gives the Fender name to a Saga kit guitar Dont think Ill fool anyone but what the heck Original Fender,positive
It helps to clean the guitar I have an eletric acoustic guitar and it was a good choice to buy this good,positive
I had two of these and wound up selling one because I never used it The one I kept is currently serving as a keyboard amp for two keyboards simultaneously aRoland RD300NX Digital Stage Pianoand aRoland Vcombo 76 Key Stage Keyboard I was able to do this because there are two inputs on the front of the amp Input 1 is designed for normal sensitivity and Input 2 is designed for guitars with active pickups Thus far I have had no problems with both boards connected at the same time and it does not seem to matter which board is connected to which inputThe sound is impressive Exceptionally clean and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound which helps significantly when running keyboards through it Moreover the amp is loud if you choose to make it so and even at highgain settings it has ample headroomIf you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you You can switch it from clean to drive to more drive but it is essentially still a clean sounding amp I find this to be a plus but I have met my share of guitarists who think otherwiseAnother great feature is you can daisychain these amps using the PreOut on the master to the PwrIn on the aux amps You can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop I personally have no use for those features but I can see how they could be usefulOverall I love the amp and wish Fender made a single 12 model because it is pretty heavy and bulky Those are hardly significant complaints since I sometimes regret selling my second one because if something happens to the one I still have I would replace it immediately A lot of amp for the bucks,positive
Works perfectly with iphone and ipad The app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed My only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it But it hasnt broke yet and it might never break Works perfectly with ear buds with miccontroller Great idea Very innovative,positive
Simple and useful rack stand Easy to assemble Easy to mount rack components but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too A little more interest in the manufacture means more quality Simple and useful rack stand but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose,neutral
I purchased these to use with my mandolin They are ok I personally prefer a little stiffer pick but my kids have been using them with their Ukes so all in all not a bad purchase These are ok,positive
Having trouble with my usual DAdderio strings I decided to go back to the a well known brand These are solid strings that never let me down They go in tune and stay in tune I just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them Solid product,positive
I would give this 5 stars for the way it works but a 49 page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much Something simpler would suffice Really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it If you dont mind spending the time to learn all its capabilities its great It work,neutral
This peddle works great I looked at many products for just the right distortion and this one just topped them all So glad I went with the M116 Great product,positive
this pedal is simplei own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals i love them allthey all differ somewhati fell in love with this one the mostset volume and gain to maximum loudness that you desirethen back off your guitar volume and it cleans up wonderfullyand when you are ready to wail just turn up your guitar volumeand whammoits a very noncolored sounding overdriveits hard to call it any particualr soundits just really good and clear and powerful one of the best ever,positive
Recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun these rubber picks metal picks etc I play guitarIm not crazy about these for that purpose but they arent made for guitar obviously so I cant fault them They seem to be made well made They are larger than I expected and rather thickObviously these are made for ukes so my review is probably not helpful to many If youre like me and were looking for some variety for the guitar Id suggest the rubber picks instead They give a similar mellow sound without mudding up the tone and they are easier and more comfortable to use also Heck maybe uke players should try those too Probably good for ukes,positive
very smart handy design that my acoustic guitar doesnt have to be drilled a hole for its very easy to buckle the guitar strap on the neck its botton button of the guitar that is Smart Handy Design to save a drill into my Baby,positive
these heavy gauge are the main strings I use Detune great good harmonics great presence I use them across a whole range of genres from Death metal to Blues to Funk and beyond my first choice in strings,positive
It is a good pedal but it just doesnt have the sound I was looking for It is great for playing funk music but for us metal heads the wah is just too weak For metal artists I would recommend looking elsewhere I am going to look into getting an Ibanez Weeping Demon or a Morley or whatever it is Behringer is limping to the barn with these days Thouroughly unimpressed,positive
An opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective With that said Ive been stringing my jackson soloist w floyd rose with these strings for years Ive never had a problem and I wouldnt buy anything else Perfection,positive
I have reviewed this before I like it works really well I have a Lever Harp with 26 strings so I really needed something that would help me keep it well tuned One hint from our son who also has one be careful when you 34twist34 the head he broke the first one and had to buy another one I am very careful How I adjust and have had no problems Really just what I wanted,positive
Im enjoying using this pricedright set of strings I put these strings on my Martin guitar after receiving my new DVD from customerservicepegheadnl entitled How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar by Eltjo Haselhoff whose preview of this GREAT DVD I found on YouTube See the preview and look at other Youtube videos of Eltjo youll want to order the DVD immediately Good strings,positive
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar i use this to play in the Church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold i was happy great amp,positive
I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM58 or similar dynamic microphone But its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power into a plug n play USB mic should not be taken at face value I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion In the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic As it is the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read So if necessary give it a tryand more than one But make sure there are return privileges Promisingif it works Not always a guaranteed solution,positive
The Samson shock mount does work with the Audio Technica AT2020 yes Does it work well If you can securely close the little gap between the AT2020 and the shock mount then yes There is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the AT2020 Only other thing is that the colors dont really match up well but I dont really care its a good shock mountAsk yourself before you buy though do I really need one I dont really use mine since I have carpet on the floors that doesnt like the mic stand shake too much Samson SP01 AT2020 Microphone,positive
I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar The difference is quite noticeable and good The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a better than a lot more expensive guitars sound I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements In my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder The price seemed high for a little chunk of plastic but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied Tusq saddle improved sound quality,positive
I figured I would take 2mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review The pics shape and thickness is actually perfect TWSS for playing and gripping Also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing I would suggest getting two packs since you will need 1 pick and the other 11 can go to the children you fathered due to this pic A little busy right now,positive
Im sure glad that I bought these straps there not leather but are put together very well I plan on using them as backups in the studio The price was just right cam quickly and Id buy them again Straps,positive
It is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand I would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose Its Also harder to use your iPad without holding it and having an arm rest Very durable and light weight If I had to do it over again I would use a music stand instead Someday I may use it on stage Its made in Germany so it could be taken into battle Mic stand iPad holder,neutral
Surprised really For the price I dont think I could have done better Nice case come with stand adapters and make me sound pretty good and I cant really sing Dropped one a few times and its still working Good feelweight On off switches on each I record to DAW and the recordings sound fine I usually run everything through a BBE so that might be part of why I am pleased with them but I do recocmmend these for mics in this price range These are actually very nice,positive
Good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practiceThis was my first guitar strap i had ever bought I didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by Over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic I recently got and it keeps popping off This is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house The guitar could take that head dive of death while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worseMy Advice unless you plan to sit and play which you wont really need a strap anyways the whole time spend alittle more to get a leather strap Spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play Scary after a while,negative
Its nice having all of the tools on one device The pin puller is very slim and works better than the puller on the basic string winders I like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well Good AllInOne Tool,positive
Im using the guides to replace factory guides on my Strat and Tele They will require that I drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly I hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done The quality of these guides is not what I expected They are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them If you want a very clean looking finish I would look for a higher quality guide At this point Im not even sure that I will use them Requires drilling,neutral
I use this with a Behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music It was just what I needed to give me clean sound Running it through the USB not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like I was in a studio I highly recommend it Behringer UCA202 UControl Really Gives Clean Sound,positive
good stuff fine,positive
These great little accessories are a nice convenience The allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip This particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position older models would swivel without much effort Bought 6 to replace to older models I had on stage Theyve worked out great the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands no spinning Copasetic Does what its supposed to,positive
I wonder if all these Snarks no matter whether they are 1 to 12 have all the same frequency ranges I have them all and they all work great Fine lil tuner,positive
Bought several of these and they worked fine I later moved on to Planet Waves for my custom pedal board because I could get the lengths perfect A perfectly good patch connector,positive
What you need to know about this mic1 This mic is very directional You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect I found that a palms width from the tip of the mic works best As long as I keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room Im in Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin youll sound like you have a stuffy nose Aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal Right at the upper lip works well for me2 The bass cut and presence boost are convenient Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it Ive played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids Flats where its at Flat sounds most natural3 Being a dynamic it wont sound as open and airy as a condenser might Though it takes EQ well and you can EQ that in If you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while I realized it doesnt always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you After using it for a few years I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really its the mix thats the problem Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound thats not too bright or dull either4 Yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so It rejects whats behind and to the side but in front its pretty sensitive So if youre singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up So dont think this will make you sound like youre in a dead control room unless you actually are in one Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and youre set Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix5 So what does it sound like The sound is very natural and true to my voice It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost That plus the dryupclose characteristic are this mics top selling points It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparseacousticclean backgrounds It does have slight color in the mids I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400900Hz slight boost 10002000Hz but its still natural sounding despite that The color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range Thats one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals It still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic6 This thing is heavy and rugged The capsule is surrounded by this truncated conelike metal screen enclosed on all sides The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesnt need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do So its actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts Even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mountstand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down7 This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing 5560dB for quiet singing 6570dB for whispering Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB If your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a CloudLifter and itll add 25dB of nice clean gain and its phantom powered tooOverall I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one But since my room isnt perfect this will do The biggest pros are that its natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix Its especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissingIn the end if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the SM7B Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good resultsEDIT 2014 Forgot to say when you listen to mic shootouts on the net often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser This is a problem because the SM7Bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches So the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the SM7B in such cases causing the latter to sound more duckish honky undetailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color In shootouts where the proper distance was used youd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser It really does Of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as I said below you can easily EQ that in since this mic takes EQ very well Seriously a 2dB shelf in the highs Another thing I wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can EQ that down a bit And finally when Shure says this mic has a flat response thats not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it Yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though its not completely transparent and honest Natural sounding but positioning is everything,positive
Daddario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as I can remember This guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars always high quality,positive
Right out of the box this guitar was flawless I played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonationfret buzz etc the old strings would work for setup if needed and the intonation harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret was dead on Absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time To say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just doesnt do it justice I have played many expensive acoustic guitars that didnt sound or play as well as this even after setup The lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding tinny or banjo like A very well built great sounding guitar For the price you cant go wrong I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price 100 satisfied Rock on Jasmine Fantastic right out of the box,positive
i started useing these about 3 yrs ago they are worth the investmentthere grat for a long performance takes alot of pressure off the shoulderif you have never used one befor try it you will like it this is a good investment,positive
I gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day and visually its hard to read because the lettering is so small Also there are many function for one knob to have a little confusion for me The sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice but not something that is best for my needsI am looking into a Boss ME25 instead Not What I expected,negative
I wanted something inexpensive and well made and decided to go with Planet Waves over the similarly priced Fender cable I like it because the tip is one piece instead of screw on and the price was just right When I have to replace this cable I will likely buy this same cable or something else by PW because of all the cables I have owned PW seems to withstand my abuse most effectively Love it,positive
this tuner works great it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings I liked it so much I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well a great investment unless you have a perfect ear works great why buy the more expensive ones,positive
This little thing is just what I needed for my acoustics My amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now I have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up The readout is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by Red is wayyy off yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune Great for a quick look in between songs Highly recommended Outstanding product,positive
This gigbag is a very tight fit for my Epiphone Les Paul Their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover I tossed it aside and bought a Fender gigbag The Fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection Provides Some Protection,neutral
Bought one tried it on a Pbass loved it Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Basslove it Good product for a good price very comfortable Update I just ordered my 3rd one of these this time for another Pbass I picked up The only gripe I can think of and its being super picky is as another review mentioned the straps padding design doesnt really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position If youre a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price Great bass strap Purchased 3 of them now,positive
This strap is perfect It locks on your pins no worry about sudden disconnects and is comfortable its not padded Highly recommend Sceptical At First,positive
Low end made in China dreadnaught acoustic Bristol actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high endHeres what Ive found The way you string the guitar makes a difference With practice Ive become more proficientCurve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirmI use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the pegThen I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each lengthTry to practice for about an hour daily The tone as I say is pretty darn good Played a high end adirondack rosewood name brand and was disappointed that it didnt sound that much better to me Works for me,positive
Its nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play A lot of songs say capo preferred It helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on I recommend this product works as advertised,positive
This little guy worked just as advertised Its a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont feel like bringing it It wont work the best for getting intonation right but it hits regular tuning perfectly Super easy to use and a musthave for anybody who gigs out Great little tuner for on the go,positive
when given a budget for cheap microphones the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one I like the fact that it adds a deeper bassier tone to any voice but its missing clarity If you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity spend 30 dollars less and get an MXL 990 instead it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case I hooked the 990 up to a cheap ART Tube MP preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it they agreed that the 990 was clearly superior to the V67G that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp Some vocalists actually prefer the MXL 990 over a couple of my Shure condenser microphones its pretty but not great,neutral
Bought for home use bought the musicians gear 13 gooseneck to go along with it for playing guitar while singing great mic stand for the price Musicians Gear Die Cast Mic Stand,positive
But didnt work on the el cheapo drop in pickguardpickup setup that I got here on Amazon Other than that they look cool in the package LOLI suppose this gives me a reason to build a whole other guitar just to use these covers ahahahahahahYeah thats right looks cool,positive
We all know its just a container with a sponge in it no biggie I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an allsolid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings But it should do the job Simple Product Kind of Inconvenient,neutral
You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand It folds up so small and yet remains very stable in use Adjustable in a snap but if you even forget that it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand Anything can be knocked over but this really works better than you might believe Goood Fantastic music stand and better than most Much better portability,positive
I wasnt expecting much from this case I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected This case is sweet I love the black and crome it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth If you need a case dont even think twice about this is a great one at a great price Sweet case,positive
I was first exposed to the Hercules locking mechanism when our Praise Band leader brought in his Hercules twoguitar stand and I tried it with both my fullsize 12string guitar and my 5string banjo I was impressed When I decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music roomamateur studio I was excited to find that the same Hercules mechanism was available in a couple wallhanger models I put them on my wish list where my son daughterinlaw found them and bought three for me for Christmas this last weekend I just finished putting them up and Im completely satisfied with their solid construction They give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably I used the provided screws which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls I probably wouldnt trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall but instead get something more substantial to mount it like a toggle anchorWhat Im happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments The opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and 12string guitars but not so wide as to not support my 5string banjo Ive submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical 12string guitars and 5string banjo My friend plays Gretch semihollow body and Fender solidbody and other electric guitars with his Hercules 2guitar stand so I assume they would also work with the wall hangersI am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy Supports a variety of stringed instruments,positive
I am a big fan of the movie 34Tenacious D and the Pick of destiny34 so when I saw these picks I just had to get them Pick of Destiny,positive

These have a nice bright sound and are easy on the fingers with a light action Pretty deluxe strings for the price here on Amazon I have them on my travel acoustic six string Martin and am happy especially since I am not a 34pro34 guitarist and my fingers can get soreI say get em Nice bright sound with easy action,positive
I got this Duet2 instead of the singlelight version as most Kindle users do So far I really like it cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read even better than day light The only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflectionThe AC adapter is a great money saver as I usually read 56 hours at night and burning up 3 AAA batteries each night is not really a solution If you have a Kindle DX I would strongly recommend this Duet2 instead of the single light version cuz theres almost twice as much screen to coverOf course I also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the Kindle Its a versatile light source and I really like it a lot Provide great lighting for my Kindle DX,positive
For years Ive owned a nice AT4033 Recently Ive wanted to be able to doublemic vocals for vocal doubling ambiance chorus effect etc but didnt have the cash for another AT4033 or similar After searching the net extensively I kept seeing the MXL770 rated very highly and decided to take the plunge and figured Ill just return it if its not any good Wow I cant hear any discernible difference when simultaneously recording the AT4033 on the left channel and the MXL770 on the right channel They both sound great and I think the MXL even looks better and feels just as solid as the AT A definite keeperIts great that advancements in design and engineering are producing high quality products for the masses at rock bottom prices 69 Who says you cant afford the good stuff these days Keep it up technology gurus Really Impressive and identical to AT4033,positive
This product is great You can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volumewah pedals Read the description so you can have a sense of size Tue quality is very nice solid and resistible The soft case is very nice also Great size and quality,positive
Ive purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store Mainly due to the low cost They work okay but are difficult to keep in tune The guitars have to be retuned often when temperature humidity or playing more than ten minutes occurs My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string then the strings go flat sounding These are not quality strings at all just cheap Chinese Made quality They are okay for someone that doesnt play often but if you play daily or as a performer avoid these strings Better strings are worth the extra cost You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings Ive had this problem with all the DAddario brand strings both for electric or acoustic 6 or 12 string guitars The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster They Corrode,negative
Great stand holds my mid sized keyboard up very well Not sure how it works for some behemoths but for the basic setup its fine Great Stand,positive
Love this thing It sounds awesome and is built like a tank It sound as good as 300 to 400 monitors and the music stand mounting is clever Does everything I want in a personal stage monitor Love my new stage monitor,positive
I use this on my spider iv 75 it works great Ive had it for about 2 months and no issues Perfect,positive
Im happy with them SO much easier having my guitars in a stand i can grab when I want These stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced Decent Stands at a good price,positive
I read a lot of positive reviews on the 95s and after some use I am kind of disappointedCONSTRUCTIONThey are just like any other strings just lighter gaugePACKAGINGIt arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICEAt 499 new with free 2 day shipping this is a no brainerCONCLUSIONI initially liked the feel of these strings but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with they sound much fuller I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s I thought they would be better,positive
This is a great guitar strap for the money I have a similar strap made of thicker leather that I really like but it cost 4 times as much The strap is comfortable and adjustable I liked the strap enough that I bought a couple of more in different colors Great Guitar Strap,positive
The strap locks do work But they are kind of a pain They are fairly large and when I installed the second one the pieces kept coming apart They go back together easily but I had to install one piece at a timeThe strap lock required some effort to install on a thick leather strap I really had to squeeze it into placeIt feels safe and secure Falls apart and hard to squeeze around thick straps,neutral
The Korg Pitchblack is probably along with the BOSS TU2TU3 considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass Both the TU2 and Pitchblack are excellent and I dont really have an opinion yet as to which is better However there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners The primary draw here is the bright lightup display with wide color bars The tuner displays the note you are closest to and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch marked by the green light in the middle almost like an airplane landing guide But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semitones You could argue therefore that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple onoff light The tuner works quickly and reliablyThe build quality is outstanding and its true bypass When you step on the pedal the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off The switch is also of the soft button variety similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques It has a nice feel to it though it could be easier to bump if its in a high traffic areaThis is a great tuner at a reasonable price It really comes down to user preference but Ive heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility Its an industry standard for a reason,positive
This is a fun pick I play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought Id give this a try Its great I love the tone of this pick striking strings I love the way it transmits the feel of the strings More organic than plastic picks Yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard I think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb youll be fine Its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument Worth a try The sound of your thumb while saving your thumb from wear and tear,positive
On Stage makes some very nice products This music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units Well made and the price doesnt put it out of range for the everyday musician Really am liking On Stage products also bought 2 of their boom mic stands and they are excellent Very nice adjustable music stand for the price,positive
Easily installed on my parlor guitar The oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl Installation is not rocket science Well made and good price,positive
Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge which gives a warm round sound but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound all you need to do is file down one edge to what youd like and you can have it all Great pick I recommend it GREAT mandolin pick,positive
This Sam SP01 can be easily modded for use with the Oktava MK319 I found instructions through a google search The metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed Instead of hammering it out I used two screwdrivers to pry it out That leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use Using my dremel tool I was able to enlarge the hole just a bit As a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove You must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible Then your Oktava will fit just fine This mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting Ill post up a picture laterI found the screwon connector to not be that high quality It wanted to cross thread as I putting it on my mic stand So I wouldnt want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently Thats my only complaint about it Easily modded Nice unit,positive
I probably should buy another one for other guitars but I carry in my electric case Im sure the day I will need it I will have acoustic with me I use different method for my bass but this is perfect for 6 strings Great for Guitar restringing,positive
For those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must haveHolds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you and it folds up keep it right in your case very cool tool to have Thanks Head stand,positive

I have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings I put Aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good It is amazing what difference the strings can make I have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have Aquila strings Highly recommended Great Sound,positive
Cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little fasterThis is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long wayIt is VERY safe for guitar finishes Great stuff,positive
I used it about twice and so far it is a good product I also use it to check sync with my other tuners Pretty decent,positive
I was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my Fostex MR8 recorder and did a little research on the XENYX 802 Just looking at it with its inputs number of controls I would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks Imagine my surprise when after reading the positive reviews that I discovered this thing was only I bought it immediately and right out of the box it did exactly everything I was expecting it to this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the Fostex Im quite excited about my future recordings using the 802 Im like a kid with a new toy Highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost Terrific mixer for home recordists on a budget,positive
I love this product It is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar You end up using just the right ammount Would definately recommend it Helps to maintain shine on guitar,positive
Being a musician I wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams With the support of this little recorder I have about 95 of what I have played over the last year available to meSound Quality there are many options to select from sample rate type mp3 wav and a number of other options I have mainly recorded wav at 192 when I am done recording I normally will edit it in a DAW and then convert to mp3 for storage I would say the audio is good not great but certainly right on for what I am doing considering the price Power is about 46 hours of continuous recording I can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the Gb card This is usually a little more than I require when jamming I have used the USB power when available and that has performed wellI have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels Many times at a jam you dont necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally Several times it had to sit next to the drummer or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case and I was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated One instrument may be louder than another but then I tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhanceThe only times it has failed has been I didnt have enough battery I didnt format the card and it ran out of room or I forgot to press the record button TWICE before recording The first arms the track the second begins the recording For the price I bought two and just keep one in my guitar case I have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder just the external mics Solid performer for portable inexpensive ambient recorder,positive
Ive used this to connect several devices and the colors help I would recommend this and the quality is good Does the job well,positive
I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG58 Im no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp rather than a PA Whatever the reason the PG58 simply doesnt have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube Peavey amps I try to employ it with I use a 14 adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic When I borrow a Shure SM58 mic from someone the difference is instant and dramaticits a far more efficient ie louder mic producing a full clear sound and without additional preamplification demonstrating why its the most popular microphone in the world For five bucks extra I cant fathom a reason for avoiding the SM58S the version with an onoff switch Its a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pickup of private comments by indiscreet band members And even if youre an instrumentalist it may be wiser to select the SM58 over the SM57 The former mic is a little more ostentatious but its also slightly more adaptable and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted nonmusical sounds Above all the SM58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durabilityI see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller Perhaps a good point unless its in reference to Amazon Prime which is the Shure SM58 of commerce competitive prices no postage easy returns But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place They are the populous drones of the industry invariably purchased by professionals who know firsthand what theyre gettingreliability and virtual indestructibility In fact its the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators Consumers require choice but with the Shure SM58 there need be none A Shure Bet,positive
These strings are just okay they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit Okay,neutral
These guitar strings are very nice and I love them I always buy this brand They work well and sound amazing Nice,positive
This pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need I would personally recommend the ElectroHarmonix Metal Muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price Not That Great,negative
I always keep a lot of these on hand These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars strumming style vocals Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks These definitely last longer for me than other brands similar weight that I have used For example I can 34roundoff34 the end off a Musicians Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks The weight is great for my style of playing They seem more durable than other brands Theyre inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand I love em use them daily and rely on them Only Picks I Use for Playing Acoustic Strumming Style Play,positive
After returning the Pedaltrain Jr too small I received the Pedaltrain 2 with Soft Case and it fits the bill perfectly I am using a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus unit and had some minor issues getting the plugins to line up with the cutouts on the board itself As the other user here mentions the cutouts on the board are slightly too close together You can center the Voodoo in such a way to make sure both plugs are useable but the overall install is not 100 inlineI did not run into any connector issues mentioned by the other user review here using the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus system All connectors that came with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus fit perfectly and there are no clearance issues One quick PROTIP Leave the Connector Brackets slightly loose when installing your Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus as this will let you make fine adjustments once the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus is dropped into the back of the Pedaltrain Once this are lined up to your liking or as close as possible based on the narrow cutouts then you can tighten your brackets screws all the way down and then use a punch to mark your indented drill holes There is a pretty decent video on Youtube by Pedaltrain which will help with the process My only small complaint is that they dont use a center punch You should always use something to create a starter divot especially when working with soft metalsOverall this is a great pedalboard I am running Boss TR2 Boss OD3 MXR Dyna Comp MXR Phase 100 Dunlop Crybaby EH Cathedral Reverb and EH Stereo Memory Man w Harzai and there is plenty of breathing room Nothing is cramped and there is plenty of space for patch and power cable routing The board I received came supplied with plenty of softsided velcro There is another review here where the user states they didnt receive enough velcro I cut 4 2234 strips for each of the cross bars and still had about 634 of softsided velcro left over For A Medium Pedal Array This Is The One To Get,positive
This pick is well designed for mandolin playing Unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners Its also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing Right Pick for the Job,positive
I used it to whenever I am changing guitar strings and whenever I am tuning and intonating my Fender Strat The surface is perfect no rolling away of screws no scratching of the guitar shiny finish perfect Perfect Workmat,positive
My buddy used this for a long time so I thought Id give it a try Shines up guitars very nice I use it every time I change my strings for a little zaz It does Its job in fantastic fashion but doesnt last the longest The shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts Good Stuff,positive
I hang all my gear up in the studio with these and its really sturdy I cant say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but thats the point Ill use a stand if Im going to use a guitar often I had a 230lb drummer fall into the wall where I had these babys hung up and not one fell or almost fell Good deal,positive
I havent used the cable yet but it looks new and durable The cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what I expected Cant wait for the rest of my gear to get here so I can do a sound test Based on physical condition I would recommend this product So far so good,positive
The fender 1 button footswitch is made specifically for the Fender Mustangs 12 It works exactly how i expected it to switches quickly and on point from effects though its only good for 2 effects DUH the right angled plug is annoying after awhile because its RIGHT next too where you plug your guitar in and oftens get tangled with my guitar cord making it look messy Other then that it gets the job done for when i practice jam out with friends Gets the job done,positive
This inexpensive pedal kicks ass provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedrallike reverb The Space setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note providing a strange harmony Some people pick on Behreinger because theyre stuff is still cheap I admit that two of their pedals of the 10 that I have bought underwhelmed me This one is a keeper KICKS ASS,positive
V5 4 starBugera customer service 5 starsLets be realistic this is a very inexpensive tube amp Nothing more nothing lessIts price reflects exactly what it is and thats a good thing and also not so goodFirst off the amp shipped with bad tubes microphonicNot a big deal it happens all the time But Bugera was no help at all their customer service is by far the worst Ive ever dealt withThey are clueless arrogant and condescendingI bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the pointThis experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another BugeraBehringer productNow about the amp itselfIts ok at best It has no headroom even on the 5w setting I realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothingIt clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it You will only get a muddy garbled messClean tones are ok but dont expect Fender type cleans they arent thereThink of Marshall cleans or even VoxThe speaker isnt worth the paper its made fromI plugged the amp into a Celestion 1x12 cab just for comparison and it was a whole lot betterIts built very well even compared to many amps costing far more If youre looking for a vintage tube amp but either cant afford or cant justify the price of a good one you should try a V5Im the latter because I only play at home I simply cant justify 1K or more for a good tube ampThe classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp If youre looking for a late 60s 70s cranked amp stack tone well its here But only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set lowTurn up the preamp and all youll get is a flat flubby farty unusable toneI love and hate the V5 though the price is unbeatable its shortcomings no headroomhorrid overdrive are hard to live withYou sometimes what you pay for and in this case if you want that vintage 70s tone at bedroom volumes you cant go wrong with the V5 Bugera V5 Good sound bad customer service,neutral
This appears to be a good sturdy capo with a strong spring and a rubber appearing pad on back to protect your guitar neck It looks fine and works well on the neck to hold down the strings just as it was designed to do It looks and fits just as shown in the picture I recommend it Great for the money spent,positive
The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isnt going to last long Also trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killingIm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it Not a fan,negative
I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright The heavier bass strings didnt really add the bassy sound I was hoping for just more of a thud YMMV Not the sound I was looking for,neutral

BackgroundIm a gearhead with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well Before my current setup I played a Fender Strat run through my effects into a Vox AC15 The Vox sounded great but I had two problems 1 The all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig 2 At 15 watts even though it was loud Id often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band and as the tube amp increased so did its natural gain That would normally be sweet but it would color my effects with a different tone and often times leave me having feedback issuesEnter the Fender Frontman 212RThis thing has TONS of clean headroom and it seems like it was built for pedals I can crank the amp or keep it quiet and there is no tone changes done to my effects This is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom It makes it easy to dial in your sound every time no matter what volume you play atSecondly its Fender reliable with a 5 year warranty No tubes means no tube issues Yes it doesnt sound as good as the Vox by itself but thats why I have pedalsOther things worth mentioningIts not as heavy as my Vox all tube amp I can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with anotherIts got 2x12inch speakers They push some serious sound and they have some low punch too My Vox had a better speaker but the 12 inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes This amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you downMy Vox may be a better recording amp but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year Just what I have been searching for,positive
The Boss AC3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment childrens church and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric The AC3 does that job Although it has several modes the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful Played through a carefully EQd amp you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings There is an audible hiss less noticeable plugged direct into PA noticeable plugged into a good clean tube amp out of control with humbuckers or solid statesThe key to using this pedal is using it correctlyFirst and foremost use single coils Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pros the hiss was overwhelming Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channelPoint two any form of gain will create a ton of hissPoint three tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRDThe AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal Based on the volume of the amp and the room youre in you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone Ive read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones I havent found that to be the case If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch or in my case as the only guitar player to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly this is a great fit2 stars for ever present hiss 3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when its EQd correctly Serves its purpose,neutral
Tried DAdario EJ36 Extra Light 12string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12string acoustic and the EJ11 Light 6string set on my Takamine No trouble stringing or tuning either set With the 0012053 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension and they still sound fine Good acoustic but a rather strong metalic sound with a nice ring and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings Sound does deaden over time as expected but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B nonwound strings losing some of their ring Tried Elixirs for better longevity but they did not sound as good to me as these DAdarios Good Strings overall with metalic sound,positive
If you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps Easy to use and very secure No fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor Put them on all your guitars,positive
Great Selection of Dunlop Picks it was a good choice of finding what type of picks i preferred Didnt know until i sampled quiet a few Great Selection,positive

Its plastic thats 1 star deduction but in this case very pleased overall The effect here isnt to take off to another planet of sound but all set at middle 12 oclock this pedal is awesome and really appealingSeveral other combinations are excellent too Check YouTube theres plenty on this great price pedal Highly recommend,positive
awesome stuff just what i want it Five Stars,positive
Excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic Squire Strat series This Bridge has more strength and solidness than the original Replace the Tremelo Arm with the one offered on Amazon as wellKey This bridge is slightly thickerhigher than the one it replaces on the Squire so the back plate wont fit back onsomething to mod if you need a backplate but the difference in the quality make it worth the loss Quality Upgrade for the Squire,positive
I got mine for less than 20 bucks The stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended Other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle We have a more expensive stand of the same type with exactly the same feature and no problems with either Decent Stand for a fairly cheap price,positive
There isnt much I can add to the good reviews already out there that I read before purchasing these for my 91 American Tele but I will say I really like these tuners and Im very happy I switched to them High quality and great design The guitar just stays in tune now period Attractive too with the Fender F on the face of the locking knobs and NOT a big bulky look like I thought they may be before I tried them Very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar If your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether youll like them or if you should go with a different brand Go with it and get a set of these If your experience is like mine youll be very satisfied Great upgrade to your Fender guitar,positive
This is hands down the most comfortable strap I own I am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but I use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable Not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model Worth the wait Insanely well built,positive
Yeah i bought these for my friend s band and their sound are really very impressive Great durability and tone Excelent tone,positive

I started two years ago with a 15 watt Spider III then along with other amps bought a Spider Jam I thought they were all great Now they come out with Spider IV and the difference in the sound is dramatic They are getting very very close to tube sound So much so that for the lousy 299 compared to say 1000 for 75 watts of tube this is a real stealLoaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone The Pitch Shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun And it will work with either generation of FBV pedalboard Says so right in the manual The only difference I see is with the generation II pedal you get a USB portDoes it sound as creamy and smooth as my Peavey Delta Blues or Crate Palomino tube units No there is still a little digital overlay around in there But most people who are looking for a great home based amp or maybe a church or small gig amp this is a WINNER and the price is just nuts Forget the Peavy Vyper this is hands down much better and you dont have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the Vyper As close as you can come with solid state,positive
Look no further these are great bags Well padded lots of good pockets does all that it should Very pleased LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWS SAY,positive
I was a little nervous about putting my iPad on the stand but this is a substantial and well thought out design It comes with clips that can be used for other tablets Its very nicely adjustable and I feel very confident that my iPad is safe and secure on the stand Works much better than I expected,positive
I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made Does not fit Taylor Guitar,negative
I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok It is well built and sturdy The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the undersideAlthough the machine itself is good the accompanying documentation is awful It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack For example it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram As it turns out the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand Good product Terrible documentation,positive
It does not stick on to the guitar very well Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet bought a better pickup YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,negative

Its a pretty cool little gizmo The clip on feature is really helpful too makes me wonder what I did before I had one seems pretty accurate a must for strong players,positive
I use this for my home recording studio This stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle From playing and singing piano recording guitar and vocals and other various positions Sometimes hard to keep the mic firmly in place but that may be a function of my shock mountCheap and highly recommended Great Mic Stand,positive
very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced I use it with my 12 stringer in open g tuning would buy other products from this company nice sound,positive
This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it dont waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage very good love the red,positive
This was a Christmas gift from my husband It is such cool and easy rest for the guitar I took it with me to our bi weekly jam and the other musicians were considering buying some for themselves LOVE LOVE LOVE,positive
This tool has high marks for one reason It works This is the best at combining two tools into one Give it high marks for form and function Love it Rated high for a reason,positive
This pick is great highly recommended I love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding I also I prefer the feel of a flexible pick Grip is very good This is my new favorite rock pick Awesome pick,positive
I first became aware of the EBow way back in the 80s when the song 34Big Country34 by the band Big Country came out They used it to simulate bagpipes and I always loved that sound I finally purchased an EBow about a year ago Im a songwriter and record my own demos at home I also perform live in a cover band I dont use the EBow very often but when I do it really adds to the performance I recorded an EBow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional For live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating With practice I think this could improve I play the solo on STPs 34Sour Girl34 and it sounds very much like the original recording People in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and I get questions about how it works I have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve thisThe octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound Battery life is exceptional I have only had to replace the battery once Overall I think this is a great product I wish it had been a bit less expensive but if I lost it Id buy another one Adds another dimension to recording and live performance,positive
Come on now these are Ernie Ball strings what can I say that hasnt been said a 1000 time already there the best buy them the best hands down,positive
I wrote a nasty review of this tuner a while back blasting its performance compared to its competitors the Korg Pitch Black and the Boss TU3 I still own at least of eachAnyway I have had this tuner for a few years now Stock this tuner was awful While attractive and compact in single note tuning the needle was not as fast and stable as its competitors and the polyphonic mode wasnt accurate enough either Moreover the display isnt as visible as a Pitch Black or TU3 in the sunlight So while this tuner is great if you want something that looks nice and doesnt take up space on the pedal board stock it just wasnt a truly great tunerHowever that was before a firmware update After applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable The polyphonic mode is still not quite good enough to rely on 100 but the single note mode seems just as accurate as any other tuner in its price range now So now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works So I have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars Also given that the price has dropped sharply since I bought the tuner now it is a much better bang for the buckSo yeah buy this product with confidence but if you have purchased it used or if you have an old PolyTune make sure that the firmware is up to date Without the update this tuner was borderline terrible With the update its good enough to be the tuner on my primary stage pedalboard And in fact it is and it has held up to regular practices and gigs Make sure you update the firmware,positive
ok i dont have much to say just i love it because its cheap nice and i dont know i just feel happy to buy this product love it,positive
The tuners I have for my guitarbanjo have modes for use as a metronome The problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome I find them annoyingThis metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial The speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed And there are two clicks to choose from The metronome has a flashing light tooOverall a very useable metronome5 stars Good metronome,positive
How a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesnt seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what I like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player Most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly Obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isnt always possible With that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlops purple colored Big Stubby 30mm picksI like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria The sharp point and the picks rounded edges help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking Besides electric guitar I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semisolid body guitars where the string tension is greaterI had tried the 10mm Stubby previously but the 30mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all Im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky Keeping the pick clean and dry does helpMy favorite pick had been theDunlop 06mm nylon pick but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 30mm Stubby I can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed Time will tell but this may become my new favorite pickThe pick pack contains 24 picks I only paid 299 which is simply an outstanding deal If youre a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try this pick helped to improve the precision of my playing,positive
Simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors Havent used it a great deal but it seems to be great and nondamaging to the finish on the guitar The handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo but this is a good choice at a great price Good capo,positive

Granted Im no expert on whats out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials This is my first foray into that worldBut Ive used it and its easy The polish is great the cloths are soft and just what they should be the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff Everything here is as far as I can tell just as advertised a way to keep ones instruments in good shapeI now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory and there doesnt seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar like perhaps some flybynight cheapy cheapy product maker might offerMaybe there are better polishes and waxes out there and knowing the way the world works Im sure there are some probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for 500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the Amazon review I dont know But come on this stuff is just fine I like it it polishes waxes cleans and does just what its supposed to,positive
I thought it was a good deal when I saw the original price the discount stated it was 8 off Instead it was only 2 cheaper than buying at my local music store Other than the price the strings work great on my guitar Sounds amazing Ill definitely be buying more of these Other than price the sound of these strings are amazing,positive
This inexpensive capo works as advertised Its the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup Cheapie,positive
Not much to say about a guitar strap except I had planned to use it on a Simga acoustic without a pin at the neck I ended up using the strap on my Strat for the acoustic and this one is on the Strat This one doesnt come with a wrap or tie for the nut so it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body If you need to secure one end at the headstock this is not an option It is comfortable though Nice For Electric,neutral
I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar and I also wanted to have backup strings I havent tried many different strings I have used the strings Daddario EXP that came with on my Takamine GS330S and its been good for year IIf the strings break I will try this one GS330S as well Over all I think Daddario is great for warm balance tones After the strings were set and stretch for few days playing it stays in tune The strings were set for more than 6 months they still are playable and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar I dont think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S Im happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings Like it,positive
Got these because I wanted some extra capos around They work fine and are a great price they do seem to be a little hard to open spring seems a little tight Good deal as backup capos Good for the price,neutral
Ive been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks Not special but not disappointing either As long as your hands dont sweat a lot youll be fine with theseBut a real assorted pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors A real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses I like to experiment with different types of picks These assorted picks are really all the same just different colors Assorted should refer to thickness not color,positive

This is my guitar pick of choice I fits well in my hand and is well balanced Have tons of picks but seem to use this one all the time review,positive
Ive paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didnt sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does And mind you I have yet to even change the facory strings out So if youre looking for a quality guitar at a price thats more than fair there simply isnt a better deal around You will not find more bang for your buck,positive
Ive owned many tuners through the years and I keep coming back to this one buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point gold standard,positive
This is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people Great for people with babiestoddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myselfI love the unique selflocking mechanism that it has The weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened I have an electric and an acoustic hanging up The acousitcs body is about 45 thick and has plenty of clearance from the wall when hung The electric I think weights around 8 pounds and it held no problem by the Hercules hook I believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbsI only installed into studs and wouldnt really want to try a drywallonly installation The product does come with drywall anchors but many of the reviewers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good The wood screws that came with the product I found to be a little short if you were installing on drywall in front of a stud Others found this to be true too I bought 8 Wood Screws in 25 length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install The included screws I think are about 2 in length or a little less Awesome awesome guitar hanger,positive
Does the job nicely I use these for me guitar thats set for slide playing and Ive not had any problems with them Good solid strings Does the job nicely I use these for me guitar thats set,positive
It is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag So if it is outside the bag of course I can showcase my guitar The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too It stands as it should and it was a snap literally to set up it was like three steps or something Wow I am very impressed considering the price Oh I love this,positive
Nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well I polished my 1991 Gibson Les Paul with this recently and Id forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was Does a great job Fender Treated Polish Cloth,positive
The jam man solo is an AMAZING pedal Yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that The one thing that i thought was so awesome was that after you have played something you can save it to the pedal It is a very handy tool Another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats If would 100 recommend this pedal to anyone It is a looper that will loop all day and does way more than just loop What more could you possibly ask for AMAZING,positive
This Gator Case is very good Im use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one Great case,positive
This is definitely a sturdy and well made stand I have no fault with it about that Solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly Good materials Works just like its supposed toI have two complaints about it though1 The part that holds the music isnt as wide as other stands I probably could have read the description and realized that but I made the assumption that all stands are the same size Its just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper It will hold bigger things of course but the edges will go past the edge of the stand So it works but to me it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges The ledge is nice and wide though so it can hold some pretty thick stuff But if you are using quite wide materials especially if they are looseleaf you will want to look for a wider stand2 Adjusting the height and tilt is difficult To alter the height one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring like one finds on microphone stands It doesnt just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands Ive encountered in life Adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back which is a bit difficult to reach Unlike every other music stand Ive used that one can simply force into position The good news of this is though that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring everything stays right where one puts it No slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwardsOn the plus side they are sturdy and the feet can be retracted is that the word so that they are parallel to the stand making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy I love the fact that the feet do thisThese are excellent music stands Good sturdy stands but not as wide as Id like and a pain to adjust,positive
Great price on a highquality polishing clothNot much else to say about it it polishes my guitar very nicely Nice polishing cloth good price,positive
Ive been playing for 40 years Ive seen dozens of guitars come and go until I found my 1948 Gibson J45 and Ive tried dozens of types of strings Some guitars sound best with Phosphor Bronze Some sound best with 8020s I still have an all Koa Martin guitar that is so bright that it sounds best with the normally tonekilling Elixir Polywebs Got a guitarbanjo Try silkandsteel or silkandphosphor Trust me Ive been through my John Pearse phase Pyramids Yep Tried em I really liked LaBellas The problem was that back when I was using them they would tarnish in the packaging I dont know if thats still the caseAnyway the bottom line is that DAddario phosphor bronze are my go to string They set the baseline for every guitar Ive ever owned Note Thats baseline In some cases Ive decided something else sounded better For many guitars including my J45 theres nothing Ive found that Ive liked betterAlso worth noting The string that sounds best depends not only on the particular guitar but also on the type of pick one uses the type of music one plays and the way one approaches the instrument The string thats best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be whats best for delicate finger styleBottom line Dont follow leaders Watch the parkin meters Experiment But DAddario PBs are a great place to start There is NO perfect guitar string,positive
NS Ned Steinburger Capo is different than your traditional Kyser style capo I really like how it is designed where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos I have used It boasts minimal string bending across the frets where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck I tried this out and sure enough their claim was true I capoed from the 1st fret up to the 10th where I would actually never use it and tuning stayed pretty much accurate There is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in just in case you drop the one in your hand Overall this is a great product and I give it a high recommendation and five stars innovative capo,positive
Not sure why Behringer gets a bad rep this is compact works as advertised is affordable and an all around handy thing for the musicianWell built solid construction zero complaints This is handy,positive
I use this every now and then it does seem to suck tone but it does reduce noise though I actually stopped using it and didnt hear much difference with distortion and reverb things can get a little noisy in there but the original tone with everything set up is worth it unaltered but I will keep this as it will come in handy one day Im sure sucks tone,positive
I love this little tuner It is smaller than I thought it would be It weighs next to nothing is accurate and easy to read with its bright large display It is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back The only part of the display that is very small is the one that tells you what instrument it is set for but that was not a big enough issue for me to subtract points for Worth every nickle,positive
I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price Ive read just about everything I can on these Epis and finally went to my local Music store to try one out My initial impression was somewhat mixed The sound was good but the action seemed off After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for Classic Gibson Les Paul sound in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING I sat down plugged it in and played a bit Instantly I was in love The action was perfect despite the some what heavier strings than what Im used to The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated Tuning is a breeze and is held as well as any other guitar I own I always retune before every session anyway Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck the cheaper humbuckers the flat top construction and the basswood body I point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and Gibson electronics I love the simple volume and tone controls yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups and the tunomatic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze so much better than having the try to thread thru the body Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning lol If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price consider this your answer Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at 20 less than any place else AND they will do a FREE setup for me after Ive played it for a while so far its been perfect out of the box Amazing soundnice price,positive
I really like the footswitch Seems well made for the price and works as advertised I just needed something to change channels on my Fender Super Champ XD Good Product,positive
It works beautifully Arrived on time as promised as expected it is durable and it is easy and accurate as well is as described Perfect,positive
This is such a cute little instrument my daughter loves it and the sound is good The only downside is that it doesnt stay tuned for very long We always have to go and retune it which can be frustrating But otherwise it seems well made it looks great and when its tunes the sound is good Its not multihundred dollar instrument but for kids and beginners its a good deal Good beginner instrument,positive
The name says it all FAST fret FAST fingers I played over 40 live shows from 45 min sets to 25 hr sets just this year on national stages My strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat grime and dirt flying through the air This stuff honestly works very well It is part of my regular arsenal Best Stuff Ever,positive
I have several types of capos this one seems well built A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it I really dont need to change that fast so use it very little might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off Seems well built practical,positive
I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLCAfter a few coats of this stuff the neck lookedplayedfelt like it was just out of the factory It restored years of neglect in just a few minutesWhen I bought this I though it wouldnt be enough BOY WAS I WRONG Ill have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come Wow Great neck restore,positive
Sounded good Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15 I rocked all night and loved the sound Next day i turned it on my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock Id like to see a real set of jjs im sure one of them was a dud Good But then,negative
I like this power supply but I wish that the LEDs only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to so for that reason Ill give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 The quantity of power outlets and the amperages that it provides are best in class Clean power bright LEDs,positive
This is a great winder Steel shaft will probably lastOne of these should come standard issue with every guitar made right,positive
Low cost strap lock that works on most Guitars buttons It comes two in a package I used one on four of my Guitars but had to install a smaller button on one Guitar This design works best for me Love it Great Design,positive
All that needs to be said is that 34 Its a Peterson 34 Just the best Tuners ever I also use one on My Pedal Board Wouldnt use anything else The Best Tuners EVER,positive
It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter The design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy With some acquired technique this tool does a job Useful multitool,positive
For years I have used a kyser capo because I like the trigger action I have run into a few issues when switching between my 6 to 12 string guitar I havent used it much on my electrics Though I like the kyser the planet waves triaction is super slick It is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open The trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser A few twist to adjust it and I can easily capo between my 6 or 12 string without any problem Light easy and quick I am now a believer Im switching to the planet triaction It is definitely worth the few extra bucks Easy and Quick,positive
This capo is expensive but I have never found one that works so well It is worth the money in my opinion Top of the line,positive
I wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar Now it is easier to handle when trying to play Good Trasaction,positive
This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding But it is not very good at parties it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make It is cheap so you should just get one I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings instruments and power feed voltage levels see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool Fun Fun Fun Amp,positive
Does what its supposed to do Very sturdy feeling Pretty sure I could strangle a person with it if I had to Im not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagonwheel Strong and clear,positive
I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents Besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost For the price I paid for this guitar I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits It has much better tone than I expected and very good action Stays in tune very well I am very happy with my purchase Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party My back up guitar,positive
I know most budget guitars dont come with cases most not even a gig bag anymore Thats the tradeoff I guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down Even my Fender Standard Telecaster came sanscase and I had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gigbag as an incentive but even that was back in the day I had not looked at guitar gear in so long that I didnt think about guitar cases until I got the itch to get a new sixstring and came across these They look great seem well builtI am not a professional touring musician and apparently do the jobThe exterior is covered in black tolex just like a pricey case and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price The storage compartment is adequately sized and theres a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched There are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case It fits both my MiM Tele andSquier by Fender Deluxe Stratocaster Maple Neck Pearl White Metallicperfectly and I suspect it will do a fine job protecting themI will be picking up a tweed version for the Telecaster to match up with the style and my lovely Fender amp Like I stated theres no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case Theres no excuse for not having a good case,positive
These picks have a good grip Theyre pointy so theyre good for fast picking Theyre very small about the size of a nickle so youve been warned As with other Dava picks they wear out pretty quickly Thats the price you pay for a flexible pick I guess Good grip but theyre a lot smaller than I thought,positive
i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday these are the best strings ive ever had i love them and may bands use them too GREAT QUALITY,positive
I have a few guitars and these hooks work extremely well without costing too muchI also like the clean almost modern lines and that they dony look like hardwarePlus they are all padded afor protection Nice and inexpensive,positive
I played with light acoustic strings for a long time I tried these and they make for much easier actionDo you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light stringsIll probably stick with extra light for awhile They sound great to me and I can play longer without getting sore fingers Wow easy on my fingers,positive
String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes one is a floating tremolo The spanner is smooth the cutter is strangely very clean cutting usually use electrician wire dykes and the pin puller is nothing fancy but does the trick quickly Awesome little tool and very impressed with it A on every function would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands but other than that its perfectly perfect VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10 to 12 minutes per guitar down to 3 to 5 minutes per guitar,positive
Easy to put togetherstable and cheap 100 would recommend I want to get more guitarjust to get a other one Great,positive
There seems to be a trend in using a Ukulele in modern music these days A guitar player for 20 years now I decided to give it a try This was a low risk cost way for me to get my feet wet without committing It takes a little getting used to with such a small instrument little neck and only 4 strings but it sure is a blast to play I wont be making an upgrade any time soon but the sound and build quality is reasonable for the price and for the few songs I use if for it will serve me fine Highly recommend Nice starter Ukulele,neutral
I have had this pedal for a while and prefer it to my boss dd7 and the anolog is much more natural sounding Its said that its not actually an anolog pedal however I think it does a good job at mimicking anolog sound Ive played guitar and bass for over 10 years and had a few decent pedals in that time I might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound great pedal great sounding medium delay,positive
This is a really nice music stand I wasnt expecting it to be such high quality I wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind Definitely got what I wanted The orange Gearlux logo looks pretty cool too Buy it Good buy,positive
I took a chance with this one since I am desperate to find a mount for my MXL 4000 microphone I originally bought a universal mic stand from guitar center which cost 50bux by the way That didnt come close to working But this one worked perfectly Thanks you Samson Works with the MXL 4000,positive
Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and,negative
they dont cost a lot and they work well They are inexpensive and they work I have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice GREAT DEAL,positive
These are high quality picks Medium is my personal choice they did not disappoint me Will buy this brand again Nice,positive
Ive been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 20 picks Purple ones with the turtle500 on them I thought I had found my pick Because they were so slippery I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip Id rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 20 Yes they do offer a better grip I think theyre still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500 But since I solved that problem with the honing stone I was more curious So again they are better grip wise but I was very surprised at the difference in tone They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since Im using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop the less bright sound often is a better tone overall 500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter I dont know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound Im not sure how theyd work on round wound strings but great for jazz tones Extra mellow sound A great pick,positive
You really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone I was able to sort of dial in a nice Marshall 80s altrock sound but when youre not playing it can have a noisy windlike feedback coming from your amp but it can vary from amp to amp You can fiddle with the Voice and Drive knobs to clear it up but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound But to be perfectly honest its pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than 40 Kind of noisy when not playing but depends on the settings,positive
I love pedal trains because they are lightweight come with a case and are easy to work with If pedaltrain asked me my opinion I would say that they needed to raise the back up about 1234 to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use but other than that its a pedaltrainnuff said Its a pedaltrain,positive
Very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and dont want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find Very cool,positive
Simple Effective Just what I wanted Seems a tad flimsy but time will tell Tuning couldnt be easier Neat product Simple Effective Just what I wanted,positive
This unit is well constructedSwitches and knobs feel sturdyThe user guide is informativeIt has a wide tone range I usually play a Hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clearIt is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set It doesnt have presets You can loop an effects processor thru it great bass tones,positive
This is a great microphone for 10 bucks did I just say 10LOL it does not have the same sound as a Shure SM 57 but it is kind of close I used it as an overhead microphone on drums recorded an acoustic guitar with it and it worked perfect Seen some reviews about 34hiss34 from this microphone the 34hiss34 is from the cheap XLR into 34 connection who uses that kind of connection anyway would have been great if it included a real XLR but cannot complain after I swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it hiss was gone a no brainer really I have been a producerengineer for over 3o years this is a great utility microphone if you need an overhead or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp slap it on percussion etc it will work just fine the sound it is quite clean actually for 10 it is a steal If this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio as I can never have enough microphones Every microphone has it uses I would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality well constructed pro like product 10 Dream Come True,positive
The Taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should You will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do Nice strap,positive
I think its good but for wiping down after playing or for buffing after wax on my classical guitar bodies I think I prefer the old flannel cloths instead Microfiber seems to be slicker and generally did not feel that it was doing the job mostly removing finger prints etc Maybe it needs to wear out a bit or if it had a thicker nap to it NIce but not as good as the old flannel cloths,positive
Alright it was 30 not 130 I already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most 34soundsculpting34 investment you could make As a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though SoSo by hey cheapcheap,neutral
Every once in awhile while browsing through Amazon I come across something I dont know how I got along without And it really works Just for me,positive
I love these picks I bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy It is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely Great Sound for my Ukulele,positive
I use these at parties and they work good for the price I paid I really have no complaints aside from sometimes you really have to get up on it to get a good clear voice in a live band setting I use a wireless for that now still for the price these are hard to beat They work well,positive
This pedal works but doesnt have the depth of echo I expected I doesnt even come close to the same sound quality of my old Dan Echo DE1 pedal That certainly explains the difference in price You get what you pay for Im using it with a Fender EightyFive solid state amp I tried it with other amps and it sounds the same If youre looking for a good slap echo effect I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal The FAB echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it Its just not as good as I expected Im sorry I bought it and I dont recommend this pedal There are much better ones on the market Shop around It works,neutral
Ive tried every standard pick even bone silver really expensive ones These little Dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite and theyre cheap Great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin They are small which takes getting used to thoughPlay with the round side for a fat tone Play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone my favorite pick,positive
This has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitarGoing to also last for a long time cause just a small amount goes a long ways Great Polish,positive
As others have said the stretchiness of this strap makes the instrument seem much lighter and I am less likely to get an achy shoulder when playing for long periods of time It may take a few tries with different configurations of the attachabledetachable extensions to get it just right for you and your instrument but dont give up its worth the effort This is a very comfortable strap,positive
I have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others Easy and quick No reason to be out of tune with these tuners The white is great but no matter what color they are they are a quality product Rock on Its a Snark,positive
Low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming For the price it is a good deal Get what you pay for,neutral
The stand seems sturdy the base is like a tripod base of a mic stand so it may hold up better in the long run than my other stands that have the clamping type of base The top of the stand is shorter than my others not really a problem but worth mentioning The only gripe I could have with the stand is that the top takes two screws and two wingnuts so it is not practical to use for gigging setting up tearing down I will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows For the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality Good stand not the best for gigging travel,positive
As thrilled as I have been with the Chinesemade Joyo overdrive and distortion pedals Ive tried out in the recent past I felt like the JF10 Dyna Compressor was somewhat of a risk I had been using the very excellent MXR Custom Comp already but was frustrated with its lack of external controls and versatility Also its one thing thing for Joyo to clone the circuitry of a distortion pedal but could they do it accurately with an always on effect like compressionWell Joyo has absolutely done it and theyve done it well enough that Im selling my MXR Compressors are hard to explain and even harder to demonstrate on a YouTube video so let me offer my explanation of what this pedal does and why you should give it a try for only around 40The primary effect of compression is to level or normalize the output across frequencies Particularly with a clean signal aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells Also certain notes sustain while others seem to die out too early Compression smooths over these problems and levels everything to a polished presentable soundThe secondary effect of compression is that the pedal can sustain single notes and chords by increasing their level after they would normally die out In this area the Joyo JF10 is superior to many other compressors because it gives you Attack and Sustain knobs Attack refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck Turning the knob up produces a chicken picking effect where the note is very clear and pronounced Adjusting the Sustain knob obviously increases the length of time that the note or chord continues to play at volume Like most compressors there is also a Level control to change the volume of the compressed soundOf the compressors you can actually find under 100 such as the MXR Dyna Comp and BOSS CS3 Compression Sustainer I like this one the best The MXR models have a good clarity of tone but with only two knobs the lack of customization is a problem You may want high sustain or attack for playing U2type guitar parts but might find excess sustain too messy for punchy ACDC riffs The Joyo allows you to make this change easilyThe BOSS CS3 is a good pedal that has controls for attack sustain and also tone but the pedal produces a lot of noise and the resulting tone sounds too digitized Also a tone knob on a compression pedal strikes me as an admission that the pedal is CHANGING your tone which good compression really shouldnt do The Joyo Dyna Compressor sounds like MY guitar and amp it just puts some polish on the final product and allows me to add sustain and punch if I see fit Great pedal and amazing value Boutique quality and customization at a great price,positive
Daddys never let you down I like their longevity too I dont switch til one cuts so they last as cheap as I actually am Decent Price,positive

The MXR Phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by Eddie Van Halen At present I own an MXR Phase 90 a Boss PH3 Phase Shifter and a Line 6 MM4 Modulations Modeler with a few phaser patches so I can compare these three unitsThe Phase 90 has a single Speed control that sets the rate of the phase so it is simple to use If there is a single knob that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit In this case I agreeThe MXR Phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units In my opinion it also gives the best sound within its capabilities and actually seems to boost the volume slightly The Boss PH3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable and the Line 6 MM4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because I usually dont leave modulations on for an entire song but turn them onoff in different sections unless its a chorusOf the three the Phase 90 has the least versatility You can imitate the Phase 90 sound on both of the other units the Line 6 MM4 does a slightly better job and both the PH3 and MM4 have more sonic possibilities Also the Boss PH3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the Phase 90 which stays in a normal range But again of the three the MXR Phase 90 sounds the best of the three at what it can doBottom Line1 A classic pedal at a great price2 Great sound slight volume boost3 Simple to use4 Limited sonic possibility safe or normal guitar sounds no crazy extremes5 Beautiful bright orange color you cant miss it6 Compact size does not eat up pedalboard space Classic phaser at good price,positive
This is my second Makala gig bag The first was a smaller size for my MKC concert uke the second was the one above that I purchased for my Oscar Schmidt Tenor OU6My OU6 actually came with an OS logod gig bag included but while I love the uke the bag was PAthetic Single layer of fabric providing no protection After comparing that bag to the one for my Makala uke I came straight to this page and ordered another Makala bagWhy do I like this bag better Its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside You can carry it around set it down let it roll around the back seat of your car a little without blemish to your instrument As good as a hard case Of course not But very good for a bagI also like the fact that theres no logo on the outside I can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke I want inside That was a disappointment for another reviewer for me its a plusWhat dont I like The dorky pad around the handle Both my concert tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it Its not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle And it just looks better without it Good bag and good value for the price,positive

This is one of the cleanest sounding miniamps youll find Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound It does sound tinny through the 2 speaker but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2 speakers I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O Drive knob Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitars volume knob Turning the ODrive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp Im building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6 speaker just for this amp According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab A great sounding JFET amp through headphones and extspeaker,positive

Not a lot to say works great as a shockmountI think the best part might be that it also works with Behringer C1s Those are great mics for what they cost but the clips they come with break easily and replacements are hard to find That makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well Hooray Perfectly wonderful shock mount works with Behringer C1s,positive

The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when Ive been playing a lot The problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pulloffs less fluid A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard Also I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but Id rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong GHS allows me to minimize that Use this to shread great for crackeddry finger tips,positive
its cheap and the quality its great cant complain i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars good,positive
It was time for a change after many years of using the same strings and I am really glad I tried Elixir They feel really nice and sound awesome I will be sticking with these now thanks for the good and prompt service as well Cheers Great Strings,positive
this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable I dont have problems with it tangling like I saw on one review nice retro look quality cable,positive
The quality and feel of this tuner is very good Tuning the guitar is really easy just put the batteries in it comes with 2 AAA batteries and press the red button to turn it on then pluck the strings This is my first tuner and its great already Its very portable Easy to use,positive
its a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it dont fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friendswell constructedawesome price Hercules Stand,positive
The action was a little high for my taste The strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible Why do they sell an instrument with crap strings That is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument Otherwise its well built and works Really its a three and a half star IMO its not as nice sounding or as playable as my Mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings Its ok,neutral
Update The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out Ive had it just over a month so Amazon wont help me Despite the lifetime warranty Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund Despite being an authorized retailer for Planet Waves AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer Ive emailed Planet Waves but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange I dont have a dealer within 100 miles of my home so unless the manufacturer comes through this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve itI frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly Ive used cables with the GH quiet plug which also works well but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the GH you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument The cable itself is a bit stiffer than Im used to which makes coiling for storage very easy but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined Ive never given the sound of a cable a thought being a bass player who doesnt use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 92 and fEARful 1561 cab I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers Hosa Proco Whirlwind etc Ive never had to warranty exchange a PW cable but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them I like knowing that EDIT AS STATED ABOVE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS Great design love the switch,neutral
These tuning machines are greatThey are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intendedI needed the tuners replaced on an Applause Ovation copy guitar the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tuneand a Washburn guitar They fit on my Washburn and my Applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drillThe tuner hole size is 391 or 2564 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like Stewart MacDonald You may be required to predrill for the screws that go through the back of the tunerIt is only one hole and very smallThe vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed forThe run around at the post office of getting it resent was ridiculousThe vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive Rotomatics Are Very Dependable,positive
Soooo bummed I simply love the sound on these cans but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface not deep enough in the cups and press down hard on my ears The max time I can wear them is like an hour and then I cant wear them for a day or so due to residual pain I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help Also on most of my other phones the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet So its kind of like double trouble However these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity If it werent for the discomfort factor I would be using them all the time As of now I hardly use them at all In fact when I first tested these out I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more But Im glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test Of course we are all of varying shapes and sizes ha ha so they might work for you where they dont for me If so youve got a bargain on some great cans If not ouch Cheers Great Sound Terrible Comfort,negative
Running 4 mics samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting This mixer handles it all perfectly Im literally knew nothing about it when it arrived first time Id ever seen a mixer of any kind in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly get hiss free nicely panned beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful professional and frankly better than I could have imagined I didnt need the FX but the the other was out of stock D Ill get to them one dayI wish it had a power button Fantastic so far,positive
Only complaint is the size which is my fault If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage Only complaint is the size which is my fault,positive

I am a guitar player who bought a drum kit for people to jam on when they are at my place I also bought a lesson book for drums for myself I point this out so you know 34who34 is writing the review a rookie drummerI did some research before buying and found most if any negative comments were along the lines of 34if you tune your drums properlythese arent needed34 Well news flash Im not a freaking drummer or expert drum technician with years of experience I can tune them half decent with the torque tuner I bought Rhythm Tech RT 7350 but there are several drums that still had overtones or prolonged sustain that I did not like in my tiny jam roomThis moongel was so simple to apply it is a crime and I just moved them around a little to get them in a position that was both out of the way and killed the resonation I wasnt liking So whats not to like I love itCost wise Amazon was a few more than the local GC but then again it was quick and simpleI liked it so much I bought a second Works great for killing unwanted overtones or ringout,positive
Ive used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars My thumb nail cant pluck the strings when I damp them with the heel of my hand These are adequate in the sense that you can strike the strings with them and they stay on They have a dullish sound compared to my favorite the long gone National clear thumb pick or the current Dunlop clear I like the sound of the Ernie Ball thin celluloid picks but they arent strong enough to grip my thumb The major problem with these is they arent large Theyre like most other brands medium My thumbs arent Tom Robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average These picks cut off the circulation in my thumb if I use them for more than fifteen minutes or so I think I could brighten up the sound by sanding them down but thats a lot of work for something this cheapDont buy these if you have a large thumb If you like a less bright sound and some people do and have a medium sized thumb these might work well for you Adequate But Small and a Bit Dull,neutral
I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back At first it seemed unstable but then I tried to open it up a little more and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here When its opened up all the way it is relatively stable and is suitable for servicing your own guitar As others say it does fold up nicely and takes up minimal space in my toolbox I wouldnt use this if I made a living servicing guitars as I dont think it would last long due to the quality of materials it does feel pretty cheap But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a whileI imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt Over all Im happy with the purchase as it suits my needs Functions well enough Construction leaves some to be desired,neutral
As stated its a bit heavy which causes problems when used on a stand with a boom but its a decent product at a fair price A little heavy but built well,positive
For the price this 50 inch canvas bag is great bag for toting around a couple of folded 9 foot light stands and miscellaneousbooms etcI own other Gator products and have been very pleased with the quality and performanceNote that this bag does not have padding and does not have a divider but for the price paid I still think its an excellent bargain Great for light stands photo equipment,positive
The neck is well made the fit it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same timeI did have to sand the neck a little it had a bump in it the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states Nice neck,neutral
Behringer products are good for the semiproNothing fancy about the compression most amp emulators have good compression but lack true sustain at low gainvolumeThis is good for getting that extra decibel or more of boost to carry those notes longerDoesnt sound good playing fastThe CS400 shines with the longest lasting sustain you can get in a 25 pedal Good cheap sustain,positive
I wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar They are a little short for that appicaton my fault though They seem to be built well but Id say in comparison to other cables Ive used for my applicaiton the sound is average These will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most If you are a performing musician you would do better to look at higher quality cables for best sound quality and lowest noise Average Quality,neutral
I got 2 of these for grandkids They are all right I felt as if the uke was well worth the low price Like any uke strings take a long time to set sometimes feels as if they never will probably would be improved with a set of Aguilas Buy a clipon tuner too Snarf makes a great one that has both the vibrationsensing mode and a microphone can be set for various instruments or chromatic AND has a metronome function and they are so inexpensive Decent little uke,positive

Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin Any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesnt have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin even though my mandolin has a fairly low actionI have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12String to a Fender American Strat without any problems but in this case the banjo capo didnt work for what I need Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didnt seem broken just not up to the taskFrom feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it but I know that I dont have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo just right to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesnt start to buzz on me in the middle of a song I went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo Not Enough Pressure For A Mandolin,neutral
Theres really nothing I can add to whats already been said about this tuner I teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner I took a look at it and knew I had to have one too This tuner will tune chromatically so you dont need to buy a special tuner for that I can use it on my guitar as well as my guitarlele which is tuned a 4th higher than the guitar I chose it over my other chromatic tuner the night my daughter was to play guitar in her schools talent show I needed to be able to tune her guitar accurately and quickly despite all the noise in the large room It performed fantastically And so did sheIts soft and rubbery feeling and wont scratch your guitar The reading are easy to read red light youre flat green youre on pitch and yellow youve gone sharp It reads almost instantly My other chromatic clipon tuner had some trouble with the D and low E strings but this tuner seems to give me a pitch quicklyI like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it Works Well and is Beautiful too,positive
got this short cord to go from amp to waa It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine short,positive
I really wanted to like these but theyre a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin mess They went from my wifes snare back into the holder in a New York Minute have never seen the light of day and may have been thrown in the garbage Save your money We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now YUK,negative
Perfect OEM ONE WORD OF WARNING if you are not good at soldering andor you dont have a good iron dont try this yourself The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry I recomend readingThe Fender Stratocaster Handbook How To Buy Maintain Set Up Troubleshoot and Modify Your Stratif you are unsure Just what the Dr ordered,positive
I was really looking forward to receiving this amp I read the positive reviews and the Ampeg name carries some weight Unfortunately from the moment I plugged it in there was this phaserlike effect to the sound I tried different basses with it I tried different cables with it I tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights I tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phaseshifter sound came out I tried all different knob and EQ settings as well Nothing helped So Im returning it and hoping I just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better I used to work for an amp manufacturer so I know these things happen and I dont think less of Ampeg at least not yetI really hope its a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful For 99 its packed with cool features like an effects send a CD in a Line out for hooking up to a PA and a headphone out for quiet practice It also just looks cool and very pro My intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if I get one that performs like all the other reviews I see hereI have to say buying from Amazon is the ONLY way to buy these things online They immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as I filled out the return UPS label If there is a choice between Amazoncom and other vendors and even if Amazon is a couple bucks more I recommend using Amazon The customer service is so easy and immediate its worth the piece of mindIll update this review when I get the new amp later this weekI upgraded my review based on the replacement I receivedsee below Maybe I just got a bad one but,positive
came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box got two of them for less than the price of one locally,positive
Hold a tune very well and sound good The seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge but thats okIf you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long But I always do and I change strings often so that isnt an issue for meOverall some of the best strings available Good strings,positive
The string are easy to play and sound great There is a reason they are used by so many professionals Proven strings,positive
I have been playing for over three decades and it has been a while since I have owned an electric guitar I bought this amp along with a Epi Les Paul 100 All I can say is wow This is a great combinationThis amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects Well built and looks even better in person than the picture Plenty of power as well Better than anything including the stage quality amps like Marshals from back in the day A great practice amp but good enough you could use it for a small gig Going to pick up the optional foot switchIf you buy you wont be disappointed Great value,positive
Ive always been a fan of these Fender Classic picks They just feel right wear very well and make a nice sound in conjunction with a good set of strings on my Telecaster I also think the price is pretty fair My GoTo Picks For Practice And General Plonking About,positive
Well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one You can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag Very convenient,positive
First of all a little Amazon 101 review the PRODUCT not the service or the vendor Giving out 1star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party like Fender didnt get you the right model is unfortunate but it has nothing to do with the product itself All you do is create the impression that this is a poorlydesigned product when exactly the opposite is the caseI have a Fender 5way in my loaded pickguard as part of a Squier upgrade Beware that traditional Strats are 1 34 thick where as many Bullets and Affinity Strats are slightly less than that As such you might have the bottom of this switch hitting the inside of the guitar You might need to either live with this or shavesand out a portion of the interior if thats the caseBut the switch itself works great and really is quite inexpensive relative to its importance Functions great on Strats and similar guitars,positive
I tried this at the store It looks like it would protect a guitar but the latches are kind of large and clumsy The interior was nothing special either I passed Bulky latches,neutral
This strap was great I was glad to find this well made wide strap This Bass strap spreads the weight more even and reduces the shoulder and back painhe loves it Just the job Great no more shoulder ache,positive

I like MXR products however I am always Leary of the metal button on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor The dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive A must for pedal boards Works great,positive
Wellconceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks It is small and can be affixed selfadhering to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play Inexpensive solution and quite handy Pick Holder for Guitarists,positive
I dont own one but have been playing my sisterinlaws for the last year when visiting Didnt know much about the guitar but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship Changed the strings and other than the action being a little high its as good as anything Ive played for under 500 I honestly thought it cost around 350 so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than 100 Its definitely a great valueIn part because of my experience with this guitar I purchased a Takamine G Series 12string last year for considerably more money and its simply incredible Great value,positive
I own two of these Behringer boxes they come in two modals and use them with Sonorcakewalk and an internal software sound modual Roland Virtual sound Canvas to play back midi files with my live two piece band The sound through the PA Soundcraft mixer and Mackie active speakers is loud and very clear in most cases no eq needed I guess it really revolves around your personal needs For live performance these Behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal I do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone DAW Tascam 2488 24 trackIf you are a live musician or a DJ using something like Virtual DJ these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards Perfect for live work,positive
This is just another cable out there There is nothing special in particular about it It does what it should Cheers Its OK,neutral

Last week I ordered a Guardian Electric Guitar Stand AShape Black Price 1099 from Amazon based on an average 4star review I read the reviews first and placed the order for a cheap collapsible guitar stand for my electric guitars and bass When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it lol no way Worthless and its now holding my sons 34 size classical guitar barelyUndaunted I ordered this Musicians Gear stand Less expensive than the Guardian it holds my Gibson CS356 Custom with no problem and I would trust it with any and all of my electric guitars or basses The bottom piece that supports the body of the guitar rotates and thats a little strange hence 4 stars instead of 5 but with a little care you can put a guitar into it and remove it with little or no attention to placement For 8 you cant beat itJM Tepper Inexpensive very guitar stand suitable for electrics,positive
For years I have fell more and more in love with my Yamaha CGX111SC Stil nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo note change to a better piezo system LR Baggs are great high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes I wanted to experiment with this item result GREAT I finally got to listen to what I use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments The sound is richer and clarity makes unique Dont leave your guitar without it,positive
Not much to say about a XLR cableIt worksAverage qualitydoes the job No problems Good price came quickly through PRIME What you expect,neutral
Theres not much to be said about this pedal it just works Its my fourth cheapy Behringer pedal and I have been pleased with every one of them This pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right I play punk blues and country and this pedal helps me obtain the entire range of sounds necessary for my various styles Even on a cheap amp upgrading to a Marshall next month this gets the job done People who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo Its a good solid plastic that holds up well and if it drops the price to 20 instead of 50 that just makes Behringer effects more accessible than that other brand Solid performance unbeatable at the price,positive
they did the job theyre plastic they didnt cost much fit my 12 string with no problems they arent bone brass wood pearl dont expect them to be bridge pins,positive

I cant say much about this product I tried it twice It seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings but I really didnt notice any great change The strings didnt sound betteer or brighter Now it sits in my drawer and collects dust Maybe I will try it again at some point but Not really impressed,negative
The Martin M140 strings are good strings They play well and last reasonably well I change strings about every 2 to 4 months and play about an hour a day These strings lasted abotu 2 and a half months before they started to sound flat They did stay in tune well the whole time I had them on my guitar I had them on my Yamaha FG700S Good strings,positive
Ive been a musician for most of my life playing primarily keyboards recently in the studio and with bands saxophone and a little bass guitar Ive owned a six string guitar for 20 years that has seen very little use I had this misconception that my hands 34just werent designed to play guitar34 But recently my life changed a little bit I have a young boy thats now master of my universe a lot less room to leave musical gadgets lying about and I now live in an apartment building where making a lot of noise tends to be frowned uponI picked up this Micro Crush because I was originally looking for a micro Marshall and I saw this pop up I knew I already liked the sound of Orange amps better than Marshall given my druthers of musical taste and for 69 it seemed like not much of a reach to try it out for myselfShortly after a small package of value came to me with this charmingly tiny amp in it My sons mom thought it was a toy 34its so small34 Yes you might think so until you plug it in The idea here is to sound loud without being loud This amp is perfect for thatMost of the time I have this thing turned up to about 1 1 12 rarely up to 2 or beyond Ive got a simple effect chain going in EH Soul Preacher compressorsustainer 62 MX Analog delay 62 Cheap but pleasant Chinese Phaser 62 EH Holy Grail 62 Amp I use this as my 34clean34 sound without the overdrive It is beautiful A little Dick Daleish Then when I want a little edge I turn off the phaser and delay and turn on the overdrive Maybe nudge down the volume a little more and I can rock ACDC licks at midnight without raising complaints from the neighbors And it sounds BIGNo this is not the same as actually BEING loud For one thing your ears wont ring The cops wont come knocking to serve a noise complaint Knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves The dogs wont howlBut should you desire to rock out at midnight in your apartment building this amp fits the billSo much so that I the man with the hands 34just not made for guitar34 now have guitar callouses a lust after a couple 152k guitars one of which will soon come home with me and frankly a love for playing the guitar that I never had before in my life This all because I can just set up my little rig next to the couch and its always there Always ready to go So I play while Im watching football or baseball I play while Im watching the news I play while Im playing Crazy 8s with my son I play morning noon and night Not only that but Im actually getting to be notthatbad at playing either Lots of playingpractice seems to inevitably make on better hint do those finger exercises too they workSo I am not exaggerating when I reiterate my headline this little amp changed my life for the betterBest buy for under 100 Ive made since I bought my son his Strider balance bike Which is orange too This little amp changed my life,positive
I really like the strings they sound very bright and go well with my guitar I do hope they last quite a while I put them on a bout a month ago but that guitar is only lightly played so I will try to update when I change them Bright sounding strings,positive
I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage It works for that Its a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables and that makes me a little cagy about its durability I tend to use it for cable runs where I dont expect a lot of movement eg running a cable to a mic stand and save my better cables for the belt pack micsThe jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell and it really activated my allergies at first I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell Not everyone has allergies so this might not be an issue for all folksbut I couldnt use these cables for anything near my face for the first few monthsTheyre cheap and they work fine I havent noticed any sound issues at all Cheap works strong butyl rubber smell thin cable,positive
This is a great Tremolo pedalIt is very quiet and when used correctly there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoeverYou can blend the Tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged onoff type tremoloTremolo varies the volume of the sound It does not vary the pitchYou have control over the depth or amount of effect and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the soundA very simple popular effect that I wouldnt want to live without in some form or anotherPretty teal green colorAs with all Boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damagedI have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because I use a power supplyThere is no onoff clicking when depressedThere is no added hiss hum or distortionThe battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anythingSimply a great effect and quality product from Boss and tends to hold its resale value well Great Tremolo from Boss,positive
Our teenager really likes these As a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers Have not broken one yet Really good picks,positive
Arrived on time works as intended and maybe moreOne day I was pondering how best to declutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V12V DC equipment on my table or rack Fortunately I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant my problem was solved I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage Been working without a problem to this day Works Great To DeClutter Workspace and Receptacle,positive

I gave it five stars I purchased this for my young son but I find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does I wanted something flexible and decided to buy the Mustang III over the II because of the power and the larger speakerIve read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what I think about the amp It sounds great and it has loads of power Since its solidstate it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end but for this price Wow I have no complaintsOne thing most have failed to mention is the nonamp features like the input for an MP3 player and the Fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes Both Mac and Windows are supported My son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively Since hes 11 he doesnt have many opportunities to play with others He can create jamclick tracks and play along We also downloaded new firmware from Fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versionsPeople who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks then upload them to Fenders user web site We watched a David Gilmour concert and he was inspired He wanted a tone that sounded like his We downloaded a few Pink Floyd tones created by other people One of them was particularly great We tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it He loves itGreat amp I cant compare to Line 6 but I can compare it to other amps Ive heard Its pretty nice Equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of on FX AMP,positive
The product photos make this look like a small plastic item with cheesy chrome plating Nope Its a very solid fairly large item made of heavy cast metal You could drive nails with this thingno exaggerationThe folding legs are clever and provide good support for desktop use but they have some drawbacks Yes the Meteor has standard mic stand threads in its base so you can put it on a mike stand or boom But if you want to mount this mic in a shockabsorbing rig Im using a scissorarm suspension boom with shock mount youll find the body is too short for the shock mounts sleeve to grip and the three legs get in the way I had to make a special adapter from 1 5834 plastic pipe and assorted hardwareThe Meteors sound is great as far as Im concerned but Im not a professional audio engineer so Im not going to try to tell you that this is the equal of a 1200 Sennheiser studio microphone It is better than Samsons inexpensive GoMic which I also have I certainly have no complaints Ive used it to record voice and ukulele playing and its done a bangup job with both Better than it looks and great sounding,positive

This tuner is amazing even more so considering the price Its chromatic so it will tune anything I tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it Ive bought three for gifts Its greatSooooo everything I said initially is still true Its a fantastic little tuner BUT Ive broken two of them Where the clip attaches to the tuner as in a multitude of other reviewsThis tuner is amazing But fragile I love this tuner BUT,neutral
It performs ok although it takes a learning curve getting used to the strobe dial I found it too difficult to see from my pedal board I am over 60 so eyes aint what they used to beI was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery Adding a 1 Spot power proved difficult as the only way to run the battery adapter is along the side where the pedal is pushed I fixed problem by taking my Dremmel and grinding a groove just big enough for wires to be unobstructedFor the above reasons I have elected to use this as my work bench tuner for guitar set up and have gone to the Ashdown Engineering tuner for my pedal board Takes getting used to,neutral

These work much better than standard stamped trees No problem with Ernie Ball strings going out of tune quicklyI did notice in Guitar Center some of those spendy 34American Strats34 have the cheap stamped out trees and nonlocking tuners Good function,positive
Do not expect this to sound like a Fender Frontman with 2 x 12 speakers But for practicing in your bedroom or similar its perfect Plenty of sound effects to mess around with Are they as good as dedicated 100 per stomp box effects Probably not but so what Just found out the best part of this amp You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software but it lets you pipe your guitars sounds into software like Garage Band You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an MAudio MTrack or similar PS It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer even with the right adapter plugs as the impedances will not be right On top of that I have connected the Macs headphone audio out to the amps AUX in Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PCs normal puny speakersUPDATE While the built in USB interface does work a dedicated device with good preamps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computerUPDATE TO THE UPDATE While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp You can simulate all you want and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions its like imitation chocolate vs REAL chocolate Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo Amazing sound Great deal for what it is You can save yourself a separate guitar audio USB box with this amp,positive
If you love delay and want variety this is your pedal I run two amps when I play often and the ping pong is delightful for me However in the studio this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options Being Toneprint enabled is a 100 plus Very clean quiet and durable Excellence Perfect,positive
I read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tiedevice Working just fine so far came quickly in the mail Works well,positive
These are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session The strings keep their tone for a long time Can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 23 hours Perfect tone and durability for the price,positive
replaced my old bridge assembly with this new one and it really brought the strat back to life in terms of looks and feel also this was priced right in my opinion looks great works great,positive
Works great just what I needed to have to walk all over the room Now I sit in my chair Good Transaction,positive
I have always used tortex picks I like them a lot and they last forever almost these were a little thick for my tastes The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patternsIf you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin love the tortex,positive
these work better than anything else I ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well Keith Moon,positive
This violin is AMAZING considering its price I got it for my girlfriend expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasnt she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked I am a satisfied costumer for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it this ones for youBasic but sturdy gets the job done GREAT,positive
Im a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher I also received formal training in guitarbuilding and have been commissioned to build instruments for amateur and professional musiciansI ordered this ukelele on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon and I was pleased with this instrument when it arrived I was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size Its only about 19 long approximately with nylon strings but it really puts out a strong volume and really nice tone It has geared tuners not pegstyle tuners that seem to go out of tune easilyAlthough Ive never played ukelele I was able to play songs like Brown Eyed Girl Old MacDonald Had a Farm and Do You Wanna Dance in about a 12 hour using the chord book that comes with the book I did this drawing on my guitarplaying knowledgeAlso my daughter who is a piano player and 11 years old picked up the ukelele In about 15 minutes was able to play Row Row Row Your Boat which is in the instruction booklet which comes with the uke I see this as a good buy for beginners and a good starter instrument for young children who might like to move over to guitar eventuallyTwo concerns though mine came with a couple small dents in the back of the ukelele nothing major but I could see them looks like someone hit it on something Also most stringed instruments go out of tune for a short while after you put new strings on them This one wouldnt stay in tune for more than one song when I started playing with it I yanked on the strings to stretch them kept retuning it and playing it and it would still go out of tune This is improving and Im trusting the reviews here that say it goes out of tune at first Im expecting the tuning problem to disappear as the strings get stretched and the windings around the tuners tighten out any slacknote Two days later after about 8 hours of playing the instrument is staying in tune better and better I expect the problem to correct itself as the string get stretchedThe little 5page booklet has basic chords and songs Row Row Row Your Boat Are You Sleeping Hes Got the Whole World in His Hands Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Amazing Grace and When Irish Eyes are Smiling There was also a blurb about a famous ukelele player who authored the pamphlet on how to play the Ukelele and is the founding member of Louisville Ukelele Association Unlimited LUAU a ukelele bandOverall Im happy with this ukelele and fully expect the tuning problem to go away with use Great sounding instrument for kids and adults alike,positive
These and Reds are my favorite acoustic strings These are a little brighter than Reds and are best for live playing The strings are well made and Ive never had an issue with quality Tone is just right,positive
If you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it Ive tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer It is great for a quick way to get electrified Lead wire is not very substantial but if it breaks in the future hopefully I can just buy another one To get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp Very universal,positive
Most the reverb selection sound identical They all sound good I would say that the Boss reverb pedal sounds better I use this pedal in my pedal chain It doesnt get much action my amp has a reverb I was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar Best deal in the world Great product,positive
We geetarists are a funny bunch well change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long and spend a fortune doing it But sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucksCase in point pure nickel strings Time was when that was all there wasand gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled Coincidence Nope These things just sound better if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds If youre used to wrapped strings and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general Especially if you use tubesTubes and pure nickel are like Gilmour and Strats or Angus and SGs They just fitIm not nuts about Fender acoustic strings but I like their normal electric strings fine though Ernie Ball Slinkies have been my gotos for many years But these Fender pure nickels are very very nice and at 475 theyre a real deal Most pure nickels run nearer to ten and these sound pretty much the same and I dont seem to break many of em neither If youre used to mixed alloy pure nickels might seem a little dull but wait a bit and youll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded Plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips Try a set and see what I mean Its subtle but its beautifulBut the main reason I love these is for playing at VOLUME I turned my modded Hot Rod Deluxe up to callthecops levels the neighbors are getting used to it by now louder than the drummer by a good chunk and I got less squealing warmer tone by far and full chords triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string Ive ever used I think theres an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime Check out BBs tone on the legendary Live At The Regal to hear what I mean Thats the stuffSo if you havent tried pure nickels spend a buck or two more or maybe less than you normally do and give these bargainpriced nickels a try You might find that youre a convert within seconds I know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up those Zep and Jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel And digging into some Otis Rush or Billy Gibbons licks is like night and day The bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickelsHell of a bargain at less than five bucks Pure nickel is where the tone is at,positive
use the cloth often to polish my guitar The fender logo makes it look legit Recommended to one and all used often,positive
No way this thing cost lest than 40 I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised This compares to my other compression pedals I ownin a metal case BONUS Im super happy with my Joyo pedals WOW,positive
Pretty darn good in every way Trim and easy to use Solid construction I recommend this capo without reservation I like it and it is small It does everything it claims to do,positive
Ive been playing rock and blues for over 40 years Ive owned a number of amps over the years including a 1960s Ampeg 40 Watt combo and a preCBS 100 watt Fender Showman and my latest a Crate 5212 50 Watt tube amp that I bought about 10 years ago I also have a small Peavy 50 Watt solid state combo The Crate has always sounded great and its what I use exclusively in my basement studio but it weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out despite numerous repair attempts so Ive been using the Peavy when I play out The last time I did I was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else I own a Line6 pocket Pod and love it so I looked into the Line6 ampsWhen I found that I could get a 75 Watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than I could go through in a lifetime for less than 300 I ordered one from Amazon sight unseen and unheard Out of the box I was amazed at just about everything The clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich The effects that I have played around with so far are amazing and I cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole Spider IV 75 And the thing is loud Very loud As I get more experience with the amp Im sure that Im going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesomeIm sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a 75 Watt solid state combo with 1 12 speaker as their main amp and if youve got 1800 to spend and a roadie I guess theyd be right But for the money the sound the size and the very light weight 36 lbs alone make this a fabulous deal Add in the modeling and the effects high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves and compared to my 750 Crate VC5212 at 300 the Spider IV 75 seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function I doubt that I will use my Crate again except when guests come to jamAnd then the less than goodIt doesnt come with a foot switch You have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way andor take advantage of the 4 channels on the fly and to upload new firmware to the amp And of course you really want to do all if that and more so a foot controller is essential I opted for the FBV Express Mk II the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal It lets me access all 4 channels as well as the looper and acts as a volumewah controller It was another 100 It is really essential so in my mind the price of the Spider IV 75 is really just under 400And it doesnt come with any manuals to speak of All the manuals are available online for free but of course you have to download them and print them And these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp If you do not have access to a computer and a printer I guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do notI guess youre SOL The Advanced Guide is the essential one for using the amp and is only 3 pages long Thats too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail and its not particularly wellwritten Therea another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another 21 pages long I have not explored it much yet but I suspect that it will be written similarly Once again if you do not have a computer with an internet connection there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the Spider IV 75 that you will not be able to doMy guess is that it would have probably added 150 to the list price of the amp for Line6 to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual and at 450 the amp would seem less attractive to many so Line6 opted to handle things the way they did Bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable dealVery HIghly RecommendedJM Tepper Biggest bang for the guitar amp buck that there is,positive
I have owned two Snark headstock tuners the blue ones They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating the design of the ball joint that connects the tuner to the clip Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint I am a home player I do not put the tuners under any type of stressThis Fender tuner is a great alternative The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark However as others have mentioned this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark So for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented However for the home player this tuner will work just fineThe tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be It is smaller than a Snark but not by much The clip works well with a PRS headstock which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstockThe only real negative I see is to change the battery and to put the first battery in requires the use of a very very small phillips head screwdriver I build computers so I had one handy but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand Great alternative to a Snark,positive
So I agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solidHowever I like to play at a substantially high volume for recording To my surprise I hear radio noises I tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards Sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applicationsthis pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money It is just you do really get what you pay for This pedal sounds good but,neutral
Works great Its lightweight but VERY stable even with a heavy bass drum micA great bargain for a very sturdy useful product I use this as a mic stand for micing a bass drum,positive
I bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat It does that my dial is set at 10 oclock However I could see a tone purist really bothered by the the mid range coloration from this pedal In livepractice situations at high volumes it doesnt bother me much In the studio I wont use this pedal for that reason It was the right price for me right now If you want transparent boost you gotta pay moreOne more thing a boost pedal really shines when its running to a tube amp for that extra something I dont think pushing the input of a digital amp is a good idea for sounds sake Just a thought Mid range coloration,positive
I would say as long as you dont try to use this as a floorjack it will work just fine for you I dont wrench the arm around like all star wrestling and it appears to work fine for me I love the way it sits right on top of the headstock and you can tune instantly Nice and bright easy to see Had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars Remember its a guitar tuner not an impact wrench Best tuner Ive had so far,positive
This is a perfect strap for my guitar Its not rough on my neck and is very adjustable Its very simple and is perfect for me Im very pleased with this purchase LOVE,positive
The Capo is made of metal and works well It does what it is suppose to do I would buy this again Solid Item works well,positive
I am a professional musician keyboard player and keyboard collector mostly vintage poly analog but also a ton of mono phonics modulars and built your own kit units shrugging ambik etc not that that has a lot to do with a pedal however I do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that I use to make my living have purchased every brand and style of pedal for the purpose of this well stick with sustainCompared to other units it is heavier than most and I find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic It is just an onoff switch so no half modeling hereThe only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20 of the market who will get home and if they hadnt thought to check may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed A backward sustain pedal is not fun Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse switch that would eliminate that potential headacheThese days most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on you may very well cause an issue you dont expect and are confused by turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those casesSo build quality excellent Durability excellent Ive had a bunch of cheaper pedals used on stage break at the switch point or at the jack this Yamaha endures Design some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure I dont see that much anymore but so long as you arent on glossy hardwood this will stay I place with no issueIve read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard or something similar All a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit and disengaged when the pedal is released There are no electronics so if it doesnt work there are three points to look at 1 unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all connected to the metal posts inside the housing There are usually two wires of differing color if one is disconnected the pedal will cease to function and in rare instances cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder jacks are points of strain so it isnt inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected 2 The switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged The switches in the Yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part would be unlikely to wear out with normal use I have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools The third option is 3 the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse This can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity 34switch34 if it senses on startup or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether doing nothing At all it is 1 or 2 or a problem with the jack on the keyboard HIGHLY unlikelybut Ive seen it happen Hopefully this helps some who have posted questionsTo conclude a nice pedal for the money much better build than the maudio decent just not as nice as the Yamaha certainly not a bad uniton stage if they cant get most of their mic stands right I dont trust them with even basic electronics or generics Heavy duty well constructed single tongue pedal,positive
I guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality Worth a little extra for the Fender quality I suppose Worked Great,positive
If youre buying this and new to effects pedals like I was youll be concerned whether itll work with the inexpensive pedals youre likely to also be buying especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking youll need them The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer and if youre like me theyre ll youll buy for quite a while The good news is you do NOT need to buy converters for them This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available you dont NEED to buy a 1SPOT I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the lessexpensive Planet Wave if youre working on an even tighter budget In short buy this product it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if youre on lowprice pedals Works with Danelectro and Behringer,positive
A little story to back these locks integrity I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG587v Incredible guitar after tweaking I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood and I epoxy all my screws in before the strap lock broke AmazingNice tough hardware The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided Easy to install just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system Fast to take on and off of your guitarI would suggest getting a tough thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear Also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain strapsI have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy but this product is GRADE A I always felt 100 secure with these straplocks Our bass player uses some expensive and heavy Fender basses and he loves these strap locks Great locks,positive
Ive used these since I fist started playing always trying the latest and greatest along the way but I keep on coming back to these They have a great feel to them sound twangy and great have decent durability are cheap as all get out and have the best multi pack deals out thereespecially on AmazonI simply dont see any reason to switch atm Try em out youll like em Time tested goodness,positive

I first discovered Elixir strings when I purchased my Taylor and Ive been a convert ever since They cost roughly two or three times as much as uncoated strings but are well worth it If your hands perspire when you play this product will keep your strings sounding new and fresh They sound great on my Martin too One of the greatest things to happen to acoustic guitar in years,positive
I had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s im gonna by me one lol Great lil tuner,positive
I purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive Epiphone Les Paul Jr which fits perfectly as does a Squier StratOn the plus side the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some but not a lot of abuseThe reason I claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear That should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this One other issue Ive had with the case is I left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges especially the lip around the top of the case Again this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot enclosed space for prolonged periodsFor inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument It is perfect for occasional gigging but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because I do like the better protection this particular case provides Very basic protection but a good value,positive
What we have here is an XLR male to XLR female black cable If youre looking for some ridiculous review this wont be oneQuick pros and consPros1 Its a nice thick cable2 Its 25ft long as promised I measured not really3 It worked didnt arrive deadConsNone reallyThis seems like a nice high quality cable Are there better I have no clue Im an amateur I needed an XLR to go with my GLS ES57 and this fit the bill Plugged into my mixer plugged into the mic and transmitted proper audio from one to the other Thats really all its designed to do thus 5 stars Works as intended,positive

Should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link Good link cable,positive
I bought this intending to use it on my Seagull acoustic but tonight I put it on my Squier Fat Strat instead after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap which was about the same price just because it had Fender embroidered on it was making my neckWhen I put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap So I decided to sign in and write this reviewThis strap is softer and better made than the poly onesIt even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might needConsider taking my advice Treat yourself15 for a strap when guitars cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars is not muchBesides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axeThe only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegsI use ctype snapon strap locks but they will no longer fitMaybe Ill see if the venerable Grolsch strap locks will workYou can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on saleUpdate Too snug for Grolsch strap locks on the Squier also Great choice More comfortable than the cheap 5 poly straps,positive
I have the small version But for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more I used in all my concerts and its excellent 100 recommended Excelent,positive
I wanted P90 pickups They do make noise kind of like an old album Once you start playing you dont notice it though Other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on It looks really good Love it,positive
I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly I have had enoughThe main problem with this tuner is the usabilityThe tuner has a poor display is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the keyTuning with it can be condensed into one word frustratingThe needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings especially so when the guitar is much out of tuneThe poor display is dark with no buildin light and has poor visibility at angles too Combine all that you have a terrible accurate tunerYes it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display which is 2 centsEnough said I bought a new tuner the Seiko SAT800 for a bit more money that thisThe main differences between SAT800 and the CA40SAT800 has a buildin light CA40 does notCA40 has a buildin stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle SAT800 does notSAT800 has a auto and manual mode CA40 has autoSAT800 displays the octave of the note eg 1E 2E etc CA40 displays only displays the alphabet E for all oactavesSAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off CA40 does notThe needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overallI wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be I cannot recommend this tuner,negative
this real leather strap is nice the price is Evan better the only thing I should warm if your a extra large person or you have a beer belly then this strap will not fit you great strap,positive
One doesnt get much better than DAddario strings In my opinion theyre twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a lessexpensive alternativeI certainly recommend DAddario nylon strings on classical guitars Ive heard no other string that has the crisp clean rich sound of this brand of strings Ive used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand but always come back to this oneDifferent diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use I prefer this midrange string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone Any lighter and the guitar sounds tinny any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck These are just right Dont get much better,positive
Easy to useGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand Thank you very much Great,positive
I wouldnt recommend tuning these strings to E however because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to E can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix The highest I feel comfortable tuning these to is E flat If you are doing anything at or below Drop C sharp these strings will work out great for you Despite what the pack says you can tune these to E,positive
Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar stringsto the less and also most expensive strings I find the Elixir excellent My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet That may change along the wayHowever I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone elses palate Therefore strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone elses earMy ears remain attentive to future string sounds I also love the dAddario make Which I purchase through Amazonalways Experimenting With Various Acoustic Strings,positive
I use this item for my daughter 12 size guitar its looks light in weight and firm and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars simple and light,positive
I actually wasnt aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons So the next time I saw George I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me DAddario 95s I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brandgauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar I definitely recommend trying out a set Great set of strings for super strat guitars,positive
Recently acquired an Ovation mandolin which itself is hardly 34standard34 in appearance materials etc so I thought it would bea good opportunity to try a 34nonstandard34 strap Im impressed Im thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin Supremely adjustable and comfortable,positive
Ive read where people are using bottle caps instead of these My guitar is more valuable to me than that I suppose because Im not trusting that my expensive gitty wont hit the floor I mean you pay for a quality instrument right Why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe Im sorry but thats just idiocy in action This isnt 1960 get an upgrade already I play standing up 95 of the time so these are a necessity I have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily but all except one snapped right back together When I first started playing I had a brand new to me guitar hit the floor and the neck break because I didnt use them Thats something that should only happen once in your life if at all The only complaint I have is whatever happened to the round ones They were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well All I will use,positive
These have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends cant Possibly better than the metal ended ones,positive
I usually keep pick in my mouth when I dont use them but sometimes I drop them and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it so this is a nice option to have a spare one if you use bass picks get this it is bigger than the guitar version much like the picks Good accesory,positive
I use this cable for small home recording projects I do not take the cable around to gigs or shows as I am pretty sure it wouldnt last longer than a few months of heavy use The sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy If your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job this is your product Works as it should for the person on a budget,positive
This is the new and improved Snark The display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright I found with other models that the display faded and was not renewed even with a new a battery The only downside to this one is that the bars on the display are so thick that the string has to be more out of tune before it shows up on the screen So the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens However the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws Great tuner for the price,positive
alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online and let me tell you these picks get the job done dont expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that a few of the tips broke off but I think thats my fault for playing too hard Great picks would recommend to anyone Good picks,positive
it holds a mic just fine I just wish it had a little more 34give34 to it still a great product for the price ok,positive
Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my Maudio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools Works great Firm fit solidly molded ends reputable branded cablea bit on the thin side but i havent seen to have any issue due to this or anything Couldnt go wrong for 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility Quality cable,positive
I have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it Tried 40100 too light and high and 50110 too deep not good for popping but is right in the middle Perfect The perfect gauge,positive
I have owned my G7th Capo over a year now as far as Im concerned it beats all the others Ive owned in the past hands down So easy to use can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed G7th Performance Capo,positive
This is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars This only gets done once a year on the average guitar so if youre like me this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes Other than that it is what it is and does what it says The applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flowThe label says NOT to use this product on maple fingerboards Doesnt say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned Mmmmm Lemony Fresh,positive
Wow Im shocked A Fender aftermarket product that didnt come with some sort of defect or problem Amazing Whomever does QC for this part should take over the the complete aftermarket parts division and replace the guys that do QC for the other parts Ive purchased A Pearl Amongst Swine,positive
I bought these black locks to go on a black Stratocaster I built I dont use any strap locks but Schallers on any of my guitars or any that I build I recently bought some Fender locks that worked fine but were too large for me and all of my existing straps wouldnt fit them Schaller Security Strap Locks,positive
I normally get Elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up They are indeed some high tech strings with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability Plus they feel and sound good So grab a pack and get jamming Youll definitely want to check these out Great strings give them a spin,positive
Its a great pedal sound really crunchy I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles I use the heavy metal config on this pedal I recomend it to anyone does not introduce noise I run it on the stock battery it still works you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth of course it also depends on a lot of things like pickups amp etc I also have a very old little peavey practice amp this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new lifeListen to it on the Boss website I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them but it does sound really really close regards forgive my english not from the US Great,positive
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s they have never let me down very comfortable in the hand great product,positive
Works well pretty straight forward A little over priced for what it is but sure beats having to purchase another complete stand Great product,positive
I needed to replace the strings on my acoustic and chose these DAddarios based on price and the favorable reviews given them by other users Im glad I chose them as they play easily and have a nice sound The lighter gauge allows for rapid yet sure fingering and makes bending notes for a blues effect a cinch In fact I occasionally have to remind myself theres no longer any need to press down nearly as hard as I previously had to when playing the heaviergauge strings my guitar came with In short these strings make playing so much more enjoyable I wish Id gotten them from the start But then without the comparison of playing with the old strings I might not appreciate playing with these half as much as I do now Nice strings,positive
A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an onoff switch right at my fingertips GeniusI bought 2 immediately The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or earsTwo issues to consider The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine It would not seat properly and would slide out I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side where it worked but now the switch is 34down there34 I dont think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I dont blame them but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure Second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them feel wont do If you see the white edge they are 34quiet34 Wonderful but careful with the right angle,positive
For the price you cannot go wrong with this Holds my Les Paul and feels secure Ive never had any issues with this Dont bother spending 34x as much for something that does the job as well as thisEDIT Bought another one this Christmas for another guitar and this one feels as good and as simple as the first one Great budget guitar stand,positive
Pros works really well and is easy to use The sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too It is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of qualityCons it takes a bit to get accustomed to the timing not lest because the switch is somewhat sticky and requires some extra effort which has an impact on the timing Also the LED is placed too close to the switch so you tend to cover it up with your foot They should have put it higher up right next to the dialOverall impression The positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives Its a great and inexpensive looper Great pedal,positive
i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dontif you hate droping your pick while playingget these helpful picks,positive
Ive never bought strings before so it is kind of hard for me to rate these So far so good Mandolin Strings,neutral
They are some of the best drum sticks ive played They lasted me about two weeks before I had to move on to another before Loved them,positive
Ive been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy This was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine No regrets on the buy at all Great Value,positive
its tri pack with great quality strings on good deal i purchased 2 of this set and it works great it sounds balanced warm and bright i prefer change strings often so i cant afford to do that with expensive set of strings this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good anyone needs string go for it good quality string,positive
I may have misunderstood the product description but I prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this My issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when I play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer If you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you Dont get me wrong there was nothing wrong with the product itself it just wasnt what I thought Not for me,negative
Stripped down one of my basses at the weekend found this very useful made stripping and replacing strings really easy Large enough to fit the fender tuners Have 2 new sets of strings on order so fitting them wont be as daunting a task as without this item Well made unit,positive
I got this mic to record a vocal podcast and so far Im very happy with the results The sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing Clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer Im not an audio expert but so far the sound quality out of this mic sounds very excellent to me Good quality great sound very happy,positive
First wax I have bought I usually dont wax I tend to use cleaning sprays I am going to be waxing now on Gerlitz makes this wax easy not greasy This tin should last a lifetime It comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars I would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze Leaves no ffingerprints or smudges My classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the GERLITZ GNO NO 1 CARNUBA GUITAR WAX Flaweless shine and protection Made my classical guitar sound better,positive
This was recommended by a guitar repair shop and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand It will polish and lube things like Floyd Roses Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil Wipe them down with a little DR Ducks Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case The secret is always use the least you can get away with Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever Good Stuff,positive
Very nice product Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck very nice,positive
Not onlh are these good for the price but they have become my new fave I switch acoustic strings 34 times a month on my 2 main guitars I gig 12 times a month These last long without compromising the tone Great price too I tried every brand until I got to these Not sure why I did not try them earlier Probably because I was drinking the Elixir Koolaide Yes,positive
I put these in my Ibanez EW acousticelectric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing not to mention they look fantastic They fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a qtip to make sure they seated fully Absolutely tickled with the look and performance VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND WOW,positive
I bought one of each Soft Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right the Hard is as soft as the Soft They felt exactly the same in fact The Medium was the hardest out of the bunchPackaging error I have no idea The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing So check with what you getSound wise the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar making it sound really dull and mutedThere is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strummingThe only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead Hard or Soft They felt the same,negative
This 7 band eg is a great way to change the sound of your guitar It has more flexability than just a tone knob Its easy way to get scooped metal or just fine tune the sound of you amp and guitar Highly recomended Great eg pedal,positive
i would use this again the plastic around the ball scraped away and the ball flew out making it useless ehhhh,neutral
what can I say this pedal has never left my pedalboard is very versitable pedal from a boast toalmost full out distortion that doesnt loose the sound of the buitar cool pedal mojo,positive
I play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solidbody bass I bought this Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR because I have a few bass solos that cant be heard above the other players unless I boost volume which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand This stomp box lets me instantly add a preselected amount of volume boost onlyno goofy effects no hum no extraneous sounds at all Of course when the solo is over another click with my foot drops the boost This thing sounds completely transparent when its off and completely natural when its on For my purposes a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough Naturally you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you wont hear any volume change or youll get distortion or both but that should be obviousits just like turning your amp up except with your footThe MC401 runs on a 9volt battery but I also separately ordered the Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter which is also available at Amazon I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter so I did not order the ECB004 which is an 18volt model The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silentThe MC401 is compacl but its heavilyconstructed so it stays put The stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel as is the case itself Everything is solid as a rock I dont see how it could be better Perfect Solid construction works absolutely perfectly,positive
Seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record but frankly the old Discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job Better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap and a new paint brush then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth Just try not to get the labels wet Works well enough I guess,neutral
Any size Wuhan china sounds great This little 12inch model is highpitched but has that trashy Wuhan sound I prefer Wuhan to any Zildjian Paiste or Sabian china Wuhans rock,positive
This is a fine cable at a decent price point nothing exceptional mind but it gets the job done well enough a fine cable,positive
I recently purchased a Epiphone EB3 bass and it didnt come with a casebag So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine All in all its an okay bag but only if you have an inline and dont want much padding Not for side by sides,neutral
This is a really cheap microphone Im usually amazed how good 34cheap34 mics sound eg the shure pg line is fantastic but Im not amazed by this mic It sounds like a cheap mic It handles high sound pressure ok but sounds 34tinny34 and is more prone to feedback than a nicer micFor the price however you should not expect any betterLikes Price This is essentially a toy Stand and cable tooDislikes Sound quality Maybe you want a 34lofi34 sound You could make it workOverall this is a really good bargain for an extra backup or kids mic It is not a horrible mic It is usable for applications like speaking For hifi music recording however youll notice it is a cheap mic It is a really cheap mic as expected,positive
I use this to mount to hihat or cymbal stands as well as on mic stands See my customersupplied photos at the top of the page for examplesOne thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hihat stands I use anOn Stage Microphone 13inch Gooseneck Blackto connect to the bar then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone The bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic modelThis also works well for mounting on microphone stands I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones or a DM80 for baritones Again it works perfectly for my situationsI always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands Its one more tool to make set up less stressful Perfect for my applications,positive
Throw this right in my little storage bag I use for my gigging materialsmicrophones cables straps tuner etc folds up easy fits great Seems stable enough Nice portable stand,positive
I bought this audio cable and all I gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble Good stuff Good Stuff,positive
No other choice on the market IMHO This is the one to get I have two and would buy again if I needed another one I love this tuner,positive
Ive owned a couple of Pedaltrain pedal boards First the PT2 and now the Pro I use this to house a Line6 M13 M9 a Korg Pitchblack tuner Clyde Deluxe Wah and a Boss channel switch Theres plenty of pedal board real estate for all of this and the soft case is incredibly strong and durable You can imagine my board being VERY heavy and it is but the soft case does a great job The included Velcro keeps the incredibly heavy M9 and M13 securely in place even when I store the pedal board uprighton edge between weekly gigs Theres also a lot of places to use zip ties to clean up your rig Also comes with a great little bracket that will house the Voodoo Lab and possibly some other pedal power supplies Pedaltrain makes a great pedal board Everything you need nothing you dont,positive
The Jim Dunlop 83CB capo has a powerful spring and works on both 6 and 12 string guitars Just squeeze and slide it where you need it Available in several finishes to match your taste Excellent,positive
Ha Amazon rejected my first review because I mentioned a competitor by name chickens Lets just say that the price is excellent much better than the competition and the cables work great Hows that Very good for the price,positive
This little Snark is easy to carry around and works great I have used several different styles and brands this is a must have for musicians Great Little Tuner,positive
I like the medium version of these picks a lot I just ordered some hard ones at the 31mm thicknesswhich is pretty thick by the way So only plan on using these on basses and acoustic guitars unless your electric has an unusually wide neck and heavy strings These soft ones have too much give in my opinion which makes them more difficult to handleits great that they eliminate pick noise but these softer ones want to cling to the strings and require the player to make too many adjustments My verdict go with medium or hard version Soft means SOFT,neutral
Wonderful to use as soon as I put the batteries in and started even without reading the directions easy Wonderful,positive
Weve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uckThis cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing Ive tried before With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching itThis would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutionsReasonably priced too Buy it,positive
This is a really nice microphone It sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price I would buy this again Worth a lot more then the price paid,positive
The title says it all There is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive Ive been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems If youre looking for some good TRS cableslook no further Best Deal Online,positive
It works well for guitars and basses so long as they are the clover style Other then that it works just like it says it will Works well,positive
I bought this mostly for the case and to have a few backup harps kicking around if I need themSome of the harps are out of tune slightly not a big deal especially considering what all you get hereThis is an alright set for a beginner and a good cheap backup set for a more advanced harp blowerIll use the case for my higher end Hohners as needed Good case some of the harps out of tune,neutral
I agree with the others reviews The sponge is too small and too thin but the humidify is small so it wouldnt fit any larger sponges Okay for the price Okay maybe not,positive
So far this cable has worked very well It has had no issues at all For the money you cannot even make your own No issues so far,positive
I have this pop filter clamped onto myOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone StandThe pop filter is double layered and spaced out fairly well It provides at extra layer to reduce the ps fs ts etc It also is good for preventing moisture and spit from going into your precious microphoneSurprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it The gooseneck is sturdy It is flexible yet stationaryThis product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality buildBuy with confidence Simply works good build clamps work well,positive
everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set excellent,positive
I have a lot of pedals In fact I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig This pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound No Instead its very edgy and smooth as can be It has a midsweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone I usually use it as a midboost for solos Youll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you wont be able to replicate easily Im sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close but for the price with any other pedal Very useful pedal to have,positive
I dont get any hum and it powers what I need it to A much cheaper route than a DC Brick or a Pedal Power Id buy it again,positive
I own several tuners and two Snark2 tuners which are great except theyre not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner Korg PC1please see my review of that tunerSo since I needed another tuner for my ukulele I ordered this time a Snark6 This one says specifically for a ukulele I wanted to try it compared to the Snark2Snark SN2 All Instrument ClipOn Chromatic TunerThe Snark6 and Snark2 are identical except for color The Uke tuner here is gloss black and the Snark2 is matte red Otherwise the size of the dialface the clip itself is precisely the same So theres nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2 The tuning is chromatic so its good for any specific instrument mandolin guitar uke banjo etcSo choose whichever color you prefer and go for it Sweet tuner Superb graphics on the dial colorful accurate and inexpensive but not cheap build like the Korg Highly recommended tuner Snark2 versus Snark6,positive

 great foot rest,positive
Sound great last much longer than any other string I have triedWorth the extra Give them a try Love them,positive
I wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin It sounds pretty good for the price I paid for it I was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping Amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic I purchased it at the same time I bought the electric violin Naturally when the electric arrived I laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric A few days later I thought I would give the pickup a try It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp Whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it Now I havent tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous Cant say enough except the price was so low I couldnt have gone wrong too bad Cherub Violin Pickup,positive
Im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder Maybe if you change strings a lot then this could be a key part of you equipment bag The cutter part is nice it is solid and effective without being too heavy yet it does feel well made For the price keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings Capable cutter,positive
This stand feel sturdy and strongCompact design on stand and folding for travelGood for acoustic and electric guitarsThick non scratch foam is a plusLove it Great compact size,positive
This low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements I connect it to my portable 20 watt amp and provides the sound I need in intimate settings The stand is surprisingly stable and good quality Great value microphone and stand combo,positive
This little dude does a great job The clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries I highly recommend I can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine Turn on your love light,positive
Its good Was having a lot of feedback and got tired of taping a make shift sound hole cover Recommended Its good,positive
Its well built enough to stand up to regular use I use mine for recording and some performance It works great Its a mic stand,positive
Sometimes it seems more convenient to use my hand to turn the pegs rather than use this but it does a pretty good job I really like the string cutter built into the frame and the peg puller is my favorite feature Basically I use this for everything except winding strings Its not too bad,neutral
What was it brillcream a dab will do yaSomething like that This is all you need for contact cleaning Worth the coin This stuff is great,positive
This is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very easily Get one of these and youll soon have guitar picks coming out of your ears My only issue is that a pick punched from say an old credit card isnt going to replace my favorite picks Its a great idea its executed very well no issues with the product itself but I find that its not incredibly useful to meIf youre not particularly picky no pun intended then one of these will supply you with picks for a lifetime Pretty cool,neutral
Jim Dunlop has produced these for more years than Id like to admit to personal knowledge As long as I can remember Ive had one in my case and one on the workbench There are dozens of wannabe models but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol Jim Dunlops I gotta remember not to get the black ones though I seem to lose them to easily or maybe they are really that good and they just get borrowed Its the right tool,positive
If you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp It sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks I said good not loud Loud enough yes I suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time This is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased Great color and retro style as well Hard to beat for the price,positive
guitar string 95 between 9 and 10 Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9 does its job,positive
Bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law Gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick He loved them Still has some Nice gift,positive
I bought this because I got tired of looking up byear tuners online Its so darn simple to use Just clip it on tap the big button and play a note The chromatic tuner is extremely easy to read and incredibly simple and it automatically recognizes which notes are being played and adjusts to the note as you tune up and down It was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners Overall this is an amazing product and I dont see a reason why I would ever want another tuner again Ive had this tuner for about a month now and it hasnt failed me yet though sometimes it can be a little stubborn and slow with determining when a note is being played and it does have a habit of being right on the mark one time then if you pluck the string again it will show its off tune by a quarterstep or so Just make sure you tune all the strings twice and you wont regret buying this tuner Fulfills every tuning need and more,positive
I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner Not sure if I lost it at a gig or my threeyearold son got his hands on it Id bet the latterThis micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice Thats about the only Pro There are a few other features I guess like being able to select the instrument used but I dont need thatCons The readout is smaller duh but does not seem to be as bright I play a lot of outdoor weddings in bright sun and this one is much harder to read than the miniThis micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini As you move closer to In tune the bars do not smoothly move towards the center so its easy to over or under tune and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and youre trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect Im also trying to tune my semiacoustic guitar as quietly as possible so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable optionDoes it get the job done Yes But there is a product thats almost the same size that works a little better for a negligible price difference It might even be cheaper If youre a beginner and want to select the instrument youre tuning and a few extra seconds isnt an issue or you play in dark environments and dont need a super bright readout this will be fine but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one Not as good as mini tuner,neutral
The peg winder is what it is it winds pegs and theres not much to it The string cutter is too bulky to use in most cases so I still need a set of snips when using this thing Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter,neutral
This is a great music stand I like how its adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in Its very sturdy and well built I dont ever worry that itll tip over I love it I would recommend it Great stand for a great price,positive
Some things are great values others are cheap The Behringer is cheap The clips are cheap The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic IF you get stuck using batteries plan on 34 hours worth of use Its also a noisy pedal Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise If you leave it plugged into your cables even when powered down it will eat your batteriesAll of those negatives aside you are paying less than 40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features The 63 spring is great the plate is also really good It also has a worththepricealone space feature Also known as shimmer a synth playing behind your instrument Paired with a chorus effect you can get some really cool tonesThe RV600 is not without merit but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features If you gig or record and need a reverbwellyou arent even looking at this pedal If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesnt have a reverb built in this is a good option It doesnt totally suck,negative
Great inexpensive strap Really what more can you say I wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that Great inexpensive strap,positive
I bought these for my new Strat They look great theyre easy to install and they work very wellI like the release its performed by squeezing with your thumb over the F and with your finger on the the metal ring on the inside of the guitar strap Hard to explain but I prefer this to some of the pullstyle strap locks Ive seen in the pastThe only down side is that they arent as easy to install or uninstall from the strap as the locks that attach with a Hextype nut Make sure you have the strap set up at the correct length for vintagestyle leather straps before you install the locks to avoid having to rework later Works as advertised,positive
I know this is a great product Ive had a set before I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless The product comes in a clam shell package For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasnt fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is uselessThe product is too inexpensive to bother with a return If I find a retaining clip that will work I do have one to compare with then I can use itThat said Ill say again the Straplok System is a great product I know Ive owned another set for more than twenty years Great product bad shipping from Amazon,positive
I am mostly happy with this amp it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs With that said when I was shopping around for an amp both online and in person ALL the amps I tried and read about both very expensive and very cheap amps had one characteristic in common which is missing from this one and which I thought was universal it doesnt allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing I had to purchase a headphone amp separately wasnt expecting thatThis may seem a nit pick but considering the universality of this feature you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp Other than that this is a great amp I could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it Great amp missing headphone connector,positive

Ive been using this polish since the early 80s It doesnt smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them but this polish No way Martin knows what theyre doing I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes Best Polish Period,positive

I am a longtime musician who has been through a lot of capos some that I hope to never see again fortunately things have changed for the better What serious guitar players have always needed is a capo that is smart and small durable quick change one hand operation that also has the right tension to make sure there is no string buzz or detuning for a while you could get quick change or tension adjusment but not both in the same capo the last several years have seen manufacturers attempting to provide these key features in one acceptable capo now there are many choices out there at various price points and frankly it gets confusing So why this particular capo First Planets Waves is a name I have come to trust to provide quality accessories at reasonable prices this NS TriAction Capo is built sturdy but it is very light and unobtrusive on the guitar neck onehand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner so far this capo covers all the bases in a simple design as well or better than anything else Ive tried for the price One thing I did not expect is that because of the design and tensioning I can use it on Tenor Guitar Banjo and Mandolin as well while I prefer a smaller capo for these other instruments in a pinch I can just clip on the NS TriAction and keep playing I am the kind of guy that when I find something in the instrument world that works I stick with it for years it is possible that this capo may become my favorite I just really like the look feel and features of this smart design looks like Planet Waves hit the mark once more Perhaps This May be My New Favorite Capo,positive
I like Fender Mediums always have but I gotta branch out man Not sure about these picks yet The feel a little more stiff my usual I want them to last longer What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round Strikes and gutters ups and downs,neutral

I have been using Olympus VN7100 for recording piano and singing sessions and I want to upgrade it to DRO7MKII for stereo and connecting to computer It has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks Used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices The sounds is amazing and it is much better than VN7100 and the price is worth to spend I havent fully utilized it yet and didnt have time to study the menu completely so I just checked the menu whatever I need at this stage So far I am happy for what I got the recording quality from this guyThe build is light which is good but its plastic material is kinda cheap as most reviewer commented and the size is bulky and I think it can be shorten as DR40 too bad I dont need 4 channels yet even though I can use it for guitar practices and session Ended up I picked DR07MKII for slightly less Bought it for my xmas gift and got a promotion of 15 rebate at that time I mailed whatever is needed for the rebate to the vendor for almost 3 weeks but I still havent gotten any notice from the vendor Besides that the vendor requests to cut the bar code label from the original box with a filled form for the rebate which make me dislike If they dont rebate to me and I cant return it neither since the original was cut trashed feel like its a tricky rebate Good sound but Bulky,positive

Itd been about 6 years since Ive had an electric guitar I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar only this time I wanted it to be more than a 34hobby34 I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliverIt came in perfect condition The action is set perfectly and I dont have any issues with buzzing strings It comes with clear black control knobs which Ill likely replace with something a bit prettier But overall this is a great guitar It even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP because well 0_o it IS a LP Its no Gibson but it IS a LPVery happy with this purchase Epi Les Paul Special 2 AWESOME,positive

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT If you play an Orange Vox or Marshall you dont necessarily need an EQ pedal but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next levelWhy is this Well the Brits design their amps with wide and musical EQ but the overall frequency response is narrow This has led many British amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that British EQ isnt as dramatic as American guitarists want it to be There is nothing wrong with this by any means its just an overall characteristic of British amplifiersSecondly any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly This pedal is more than capable of providing that boost 15dB seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty or dirty to overdrive or overdrive to distortionLIVE PERFORMANCE If youre in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs youve probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bassmidrange noise 100500Hz that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter Applying EQ to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary lowend from the picture and boosting your highend for better clarityRECORDING DIRECTIN If youre using this pedal with a DI box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping youll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your Strat or brighten your Les PaulWHY 4 STARS Yes the noise Its not bothersome by any means but if youre recording with a micd amp or direct in you will absolutely need a noise suppressor I use my GE7 with the BOSS NS2 and the NS2 completely removes the white noise generated from the GE7 The result is an amazing clean boosting EQIF YOURE ON THE FENCE go ahead and get this thing You wont regret it Its not just for Tone Snobs it can really make cheap gear sound way better and take great gear to the next level A Must Own for British Tube Amps,positive

I had done a fair amount of research on banjos before I bought this It has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well Yes there many banjos and some with more frills There is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch I am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely I see no flaws on my banjo I did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others I bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at Amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping If I could give it more than 5 stars I would I can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy I also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either While I am expert on banjo I would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either A keeper for sure Not a skeptic anymore,positive

Its a tight fitting case I am a proud owner of aEpiphone Les Paul Custom Proand it fits as snug as can be When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar It arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic I am sure I received a new case Being perfectly protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it soAs far as the construction it not a flight case by any means It looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job to protect the guitar My guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit With this said over time there is a possibility of wear I would predict the buckles may be the first to fail And then handle doesnt look as durable as it could be well see on thatOverall this is the case for the Epiphone Les Paul I saw the Gibson case and I just dont see them as superior enough to justify paying more I am satisfied with my purchase and I think most people would be Five stars for now I will edit in the future if necessary Tight Fit,positive

I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome I have another tuner which is set EADGBE that is much easy to tune without any confusion Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently its confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left right 20 or more However its a bonus for using the tuner and I dont have to bring all to the classes For the metronome which is my initial purpose to purchase it its great and have enough adjustable calibration 13 beats rhythms and tempos for practices Okay but Tuner is confusing,positive

The Planet Waves DAddario Artist Capo seems like a classic case of trying to do everything and not quite getting it right as a result The capo has a microadjusting knob but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars such as my Seagull that have nonstandard width fretboards The builtin pick holder is useful but Planet Waves offers another less 34Artist34 model that also has one In fact the other Planet Waves capo I have is much more amenable to different width necks than this one The Artist capo also has an adapter that allows The player to attach one of those small clipon tuners directly too the capo Assuming that you dont use the capo constantly why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitars headstock Check out other offerings from Planet Waves you can do better for less than with this one There Are Better,neutral

I have been playing guitar for more years than I care to admit Okay I bought a 1966 Telecaster brand new back then Still have it and love it I have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and 4 acoustics On my electrics I love extra light 8 gauge strings Only about 5 of us do I can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings Anyhow I digress but for a reason Light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the 05034 found on Gibons and ESPLTDs When you squeeze the string to fret it with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board With XLarge jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune The cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as 10s or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board So most capos work with 10s and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings So a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zoneSo since I use lighter gauge strings and even 9s are subject to the same limitation I have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp Guess what Now I found it I have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one To be honest with you I was surprised when it workedOkay so here is how I put it to the test I used the Snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it I also have the Peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy Okay back to the explanationWith the Snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side The only problem is that most any headstock tuner I have seen they arent superbly accurate The Peterson headstock tuner I sent back because it was acting crazy Anyhow So the secret to using the Snark which I like best out of the headstock tuners I have tried is to tune the open string first and then fret the string on lets say the 5th fret You will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune even though it may be a little sharp or a little flat so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it so your ears can hear it in order to get it spot on There is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar and nothing worse than one that is well out of tuneSo by tuning the open string and then tuning the fretted string once both are in tune it is right on So in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp not enough to register on the tuner when you fret that string for example on the 5th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit making it sharper which will now show on the Snark as a note that is too sharp Once you balance the open string and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument You dont even need to hear it So your audience is not listening to you tune up yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so wellSo with that being said you can more fully understand why this DAddario NS Artist Capo is the cat8217s meow It is the first tuner that I ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck It is adjustable like the others are but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as wellYou often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo not with this one even with light gauge strings I must admit I was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on that it immediately did the job just right It wasnt even a little bit sharpTo be super critical here is another tip When using this capo put it closer to the fret rather than in the middle between two frets For some reason it stretches the string less in doing so It has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets I did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets With 8 gauge stringsSince the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune The best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example rather than right below the third one Right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also just like right above the second one does but it keeps the capo way out of your way As a matter of fact I am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords that I sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong With a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that To say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand You just slide it down to being right above the fret below it rather than right below the fret above itSo there it is This Capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp Of course if it can accurately handle 8s it will breeze through anything thicker Out of the box it is set at its lightest setting and that is perfect for 8s on the Telecaster I tried it on Teles and Strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks So it will work the same with bothSo I guess I cant recommend this capo high enough since it is the ONLY one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings My only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when using a different guitar I might get another one for a backup Finally Found my Capo This One is It Look No Further,positive

I am a fan of Joyo I own the vintage OD the Ultimate Drive the Sweet Baby the US Dream the Crunchbox clone and this one This is probably my least favorite Joyo pedal Im giving it 3 stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap but the octive leaves much to be desired I have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue Apparently one of the components is installed in a reversed positon which results in the lackluster octive I havent taken mine apart for the fix but I read that its just unsolder flip and resolder the same component You can google it for better instructions Still this aint bad for the pocket change they charge The reason I havent fixed it yet is I have the feeling that once I mod it it will sound just like my Dano French Toast albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass Requires a mod to reach its potential,neutral

I have had and tried about every compressor out there Lastly the old standard Dyna Comp Only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone Blah This is a very transparent compressor I use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric Low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 1100 It gives wonderful string balance and sustain At this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds And it does not wack the bottom out of your tone None of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string Just balance and sustain As close to a rack mount as it gets The blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues From here you can get any type of compression you want or need Mine has a white case EXCELLENT COMPRESSOR,positive

A very nice pick both in feel texture and design I picked it up and started strumming and immediately felt something different something smoother and more comfortable more natural Im very satisfied with this pick Theres a cheeky little message on the label 34Warning may improve your playing34 and thats no joke Only complaint is that its fairly small about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a 25 cent piece But thats okay I got this the same time as I got a set of Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III the yellowish ones and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks and I think I like this one the best All three are 34tight grip34 picks and all the same size but Id say that I like this one the best of the three theyre all good though Id rate the 427P3 nextbest and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after thatOne complaint they sent mine in a bloody great big oversized padded envelope suitable for CDs Kind of overkill if you ask me for only six picks but I shouldnt complain they arrived in great condition Great pick with a nice tight grip excellent strumming a bit small though about as big as a nickel,positive
I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus I have several bad habits including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds 05mm and really like them The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required and I find the hole to be in a very naturalfeeling spot The pick is fairly long but I have not had any accuracy problems with them and so far durability has been goodI still use other picks too but I really like these and cant imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand No More Dropped Picks,positive

For a good basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings its difficult to go wrong with DAddarios EXL110s The range of thicknesses generally works well and DAddarios tend to be pretty consistent Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s eg coating super brightness and so on and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string eg sets that start with 9s or 11s but for most purposes these work great hold their tuning well and seem to last pretty well too Excellent Basic Electric Guitar Strings,positive

I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar and will soon replace them On quality control the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it two of which show after stringing the guitar String did not break as I rather expected but it looks bad On sound these seemed okay at first but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week especially the high B and E steel strings which just dont sound that good to me And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck more so than other sets I have usedGuess Ill go back to DAddario and Ernie Ball Poor Quality Control Unsatisfactory Sound,negative

almost as good btw POD X3Live and XTPro the HD models are noticeably better and the fizz is GONE GONE GONE the original POD and 20 which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time and the ToneLab SE which I missed for a while but not anymoreI made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a Bassman 4x10 alongside the Dr Z and it is the coolest sound Ive ever made with this guitar easily Better sounding to my ears than the real amps Ive been using maybe because I put them off stage and dont run them very loud I ADORE the sound of this unitOh and as always forget about all the presets Theyre probably all as useless as you imagine they might beNow the bad news And its significant for someFirst off editing is clunky like it was on the XT and X3Live Just forget about trying to use the display Connect to a computer Seriously When you start from an init patch you only get lucky it seems to manage to coax it into two amp configNext The functionality of this unit is exaggerated by its specs You will almost certainly NOT be able to do 8 FX at once the way youre thinking Why Lets say you use an XT or a X3 think about what youre used toYou start with 8 FXSubtract effect banks for1 volume pedal you need to use an effect bank You might be able to use an analog pedal but I like my volume after my compressor so I have to do it in the loop I guess2 FX loop only works with an effect bank Line6 is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade Seems like you could3 Noise Gate used to be always available dont worry if you mix this with the M13 as I plan to do though as the M13 has a great gate I mostly use clean or just barely brokenup amps so I might be able to skip this4 Wah this is always available and active in the X3 and below5 PostEQ The X3Live had a final EQ before final output that I liked a lot in addition to all the other FX too You need to dedicate an FX bank nowSO you might only have 3FX left For me put in a clean boost and tube drive which I think sound better in this box than they did in the M13 Probably because theyre digitally part of the signal is all I can think and a verb for the amp No slots left What if you need delay and modulation EEK I have to rethink the way I use FX in this box Still evaluating how that will work for meWhat if youre a guy like me who was using the X3Live occasionally as a onebox solution for a dualvoice guitar All my guitars have piezo bridges No diceI will have to use an acoustic preamp No matter I have one I will probably dedicate a null amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix itIn addition there arent as many computerrecording routing options as the X3Live and the SUPERsweet ability to switch between two FX chains in one patch instead of switching programs is gone As far back as my old Vox ToneLab SE I could literally switch channels from one ampcab to another in the same FX chain You could do something similar on the X3Live Not here Also Line 6 why on earth cant you make the Midi in and out work as a USB Midi interface with this unit How complicated can that really beIn short the X3Live has significantly SIGNIFICANTLY more flexibility imho than this unit for many of us at least and ought not to have been discontinued imho For some of you its still a viable optionYou also still might need your other FXI thought it might be possible that this unit even if I needed to use my AG Stomp for my acoustic side again which Im happy to do would bump my M13 off the stage It did not at first but after a while I did indeed get rid of the M13 and dont miss it That said I think from what Im hearing that some of the FX especially the dirt pedals work FAR better inside this box than they do in the M13 when you connect it to a POD or ampMy favorite patches so far that Ive made which use the Bassman model and the UNBELIEVABLE Dr Z model far and AWAY my favorite amp model EVAH dont leave any room for modulation or other special FX Im not a switch whole patches on the fly guy I turn FX off and on But after a bit of tweaking and patchmaking I discovered that for my sounds I didnt need dual amp chains that often so I have all my flexibility backSo am I complaining about these limitations No Because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary Id take off a full star for this shortcoming but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that I cant do itThere will at some point I hope be a nextgeneration of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings but I have to say for this price I am totally satisfied with the soundIn the meantime am I willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one Heck yes it sounds that good I even love the models of amps I know Ill never use for the first time ever And after a few months of experimenting I was able to make patches that completely worked for my twovoice guitar stuff with NO additional outboard gear if I didnt want So Ive simplified to where I wanted to and no longer feel like Im really compromising anythingSo started with a rig consisting of the HD500 and sometimes an M13 and an acoustic preamp currently a Yamaha AGStomp mixed in with the HD signal through the aux input Ive now gotten to the point where I can do everything I want if I need without the additional pedals and I sold the M13 I kept a few analog pedals and such that I just like but rarely take them out of the house anymoreIm only nitpicking so that you will know all the tradeoffs For what I have been fantasizing about basically an M13 in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box this is as close as were probably going to come And did I mention the SOUND Its seriously greatUPDATE I have learned that I will indeed have no problem replacing my M13 as well and sold it off I thought Id miss it but I dontUPDATE As of February 2012 I have supplemented this product with a black James Tyler Variax JTV59 Korean and its a marriage made in heaven If you are going to go with this product and if you are looking for a new guitar check out the new Variaxes Totally amazing Actually 45 stars but I rounded up GREAT SOUNDS THE FIZZ IS GONE,positive
Im a long time DAddario user From the time I started playing Ive tried most of the different brands out there and always end up back with my DAddarios I got the 09s to try on my Strat and the 10s to try on my LP and found that these new NYXL strings do have a little better output and stay in tune a little better but the trade off is the cost Currently theyre 1199 on here compared to 499 or less for the regular version So if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration I dont go through strings that frequently Ill change on each guitar every 2 to 3 months so its not a big concern for me Nice Improvement,positive
I used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar Fender Strat I was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked The end that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings I highly recommend it A handy gadget to have arround,positive

When I first saw this item I wondered Why is the regular guitar version 699 and the bass version only 499Suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and I realized the bass version only has to tune FOUR strings instead of six So it costs less because we dont need to use it as muchBut then I remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought okay shouldnt they have a 599 one for 5string bass guitarsSadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when I realized with some dismay that there are even 6string bass guitars Will this even work on a 6string bass After all thats 2 more strings than its intended purposeThese perplexing questions aside I find this to be an excellent and ideal tool Its function is threefold1 String winder2 String cutter3 Peg pullerSo no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string All the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonablypriced tool Made by Daddario the quality lives up to the brand Its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed It does everything its supposed to do does it well and is of good constructionPROS Good strong welldesigned unitCONS The winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use I would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening Because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5I note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time Some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head Others report it being so shallow it slips off the keysWhat I believe is that it is a mistake to sell the BASS and STANDARD GUITAR version on the same page From what I can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the BASS guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it Imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity Its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unitSome have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge The one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isnt careful the same holds true for needle nose pliersBottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what theyre doing dont get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using ANY modification tool I suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings 0 to 60 in 5 seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar Turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine Be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didnt simply start a new listing when redesigning the device So many questions so many questions,positive

This product is great I use it after every session Keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board Every guitar player should keep this in their case Good Product,positive
I installed one on my Larrivee D10E which created a more focused and pleasing bass response and reduced feedback when amplified I then tried one on my Breedlove Custom Revival OM with poor results I believe the Breedloves inherent bass response conflicts with what the oport is supposed to accomplish In both cases I had to cut slots for my pickup controls which takes a little time and care to do neatly I think for 20 bucks it is worth a shot but dont expect miracles Partially Effective,neutral

This was bought based on the advice of others I had a cable with the standard NeutrikSwitchcrafttype ends fail on me and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usageIt worked great for about 46 months and then broke It happened so quickly the trad types seem to take longer that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar After confirming the guitar was okay I tried a shorter cable which worked fineDAddario does offer lifetime replacement but it puts you in a bit of a bind you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable outofpocket You also have to get RA Taken altogether this makes it a deal breaker The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years In my case I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first goround and got a really nice DiMarzio cableAgain this cable SOUNDS good while it works capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons I dont get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range This one meets half of those criteria but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later Well expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespanSo the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup and is still in the original packaging I figure Ill use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable so it should last a long time in that situation If I have a few for the shipping and DAddario is still honoring the lifetime warranty ifwhen the 2nd one breaks I may get it replaced More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it Even 4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacementIf this cable would have last 15 to 2 years Id probably give it 5 stars given the price And if DAddario took away the warranty thing it would probably reshape the customers perception on what something at this price should cost because its a wear item plain and simple IDK how much RD its worth their trouble to put in something at this price point but thats is what I would shoot for a realistically acceptable period of troublefree use wno warranty as the tradeoff That would NOT make it a deal breaker was good while it worked,negative
I was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results It helped some but didnt get rid of the noise entirely It also makes the strings feel nice as well I will continue to use it Interesting product,positive

If you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment It protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up Supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar Great accessory,positive
I think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges What resulted for me was the perfect gauge string They almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights I also think these strings last a decent amount of time particularly if you wipe your strings after playing which I need to get better at doing Bottom line I highly recommend these they are the strings that I use and have been using for several years now My Favorite Acoustic Strings,positive
If you are like me that you love playing music this is a good buy It pretty much does what its supposed to So you plug it and its ready to use Its pretty fast and accurate for its price Light weightThe only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the 6th stringOverall its good enough to buy it Its ok,neutral
I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where its costs more than AmazonI think the Amazon price is the best youll findIt works as well as expensive tuners In addition to tuning up the strings I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonationBe advised though that it only registers natural notes and sharps It does not show a readout of flat notes instead it shows the 34equivalent34 note But as violin players know a B flat is NOT the same as an ABut it doesnt just read the letter of the note your on The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below itFor ten bucks you cant go wrong This works and its cheap on Amazon,positive
As a musician I wanted both a PA and an instrument amp but I also wanted extra inputs and outputs This has it all Whether you want to output TO a PA or FROM a PA TO your guitar amp or FROM itand even play your MP3 player while you play AND sing If you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it The tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a 55 speaker Link to a bass amp or subwoofer and you definitely have full sound Certainly loud enough for a 1manband gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music I know its a copy of other speakeramps but its a Behringer I think its a wonderful and adequate MustHave for any musician DoItAll Sound Device,positive
I got this to install it on a podium It is perfect The construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place Get it if you need one Great Deal,positive
I have a Boss OD which I realize now matches well with my little Vox tube amp so I use this Bad Monkey pedal when I go direct for low level or headphone playing Good price good tone pretty versatile but I like the mid boost and harmonics I get from the Boss The BM might work better with solid state Used mostly as DI,positive

Ive been playing guitar for about 15 years and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar Taylor Guitars 414CELTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce Whats even better is how long they lastIm pretty hard on my strings I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks 12 Pack Purple 114mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks Theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands But after about a year of listening to these only gone through 3 sets so far theyre worth the extra few bucks Sound bright and clear last a long time,positive
This mic stand does everything it says it will and is adjustable in every conceivable way In fact the boom has a really nice adjusting lever making it easy to loosen and tighten The only drawback I found is the tripod configuration of its feet making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances especially when youre emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on I would much prefer a round base Other than that it makes for a great homegarage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin it Nuff said Nice stand,positive
I am proud to have this product Fits my fender well looks amazing Great quality in it also I am pleased Very Nice,positive
I buy Elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now They last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string Ive ever used The nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference They take several months to wear out as opposed to the weeks other major brands last They may cost a bit more than the competition but if you try them and love them as much as I do youll never use anything else again Great tone incredibly durable,positive
While not as soft and supple as suede straps I am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well The button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing It is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot It is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker Allinall its a good strap for the money which wasnt much Good entry leather strap,positive
I like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works Why thats overly important in a volume pedal Im not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging It takes up a huge footprint on a board so I generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoeboot on the thing and that is comforting while playing Overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and doesnt suck the tone like other volume pedals Good buy Jim Dunlop DVP1 Dun Grip Rubber Tread Vol Peda,positive
Works just as I need it to Adjusts easily nice width comfy enough for meI ordered one and had a problem with the pins lining up and had to exchange it for another one Sam Ash was very courteous in fixing the problem Great,positive
Impressed with this set I installed them today and have been playing for a few hours My wife thinks my guitar looks better now and I agree Im not sure if they are supposed to be flush and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out I think my guitars tone has improved a little too but I also installed new strings Qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins Sounds and looks better,positive
Im sick of protools and I wanted to find something cheap and easy until I could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase This unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so I went for itIm using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick The problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input Ive tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isnt external to the unit I even tested the exact same mic cable input into my MBox with protools and got a clean recording I actually like this units tone better than the mbox it seems more transparent If not for the hum it would get 5 starsUnfortunately hum is a pretty big problem The hum isnt loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks If you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise I even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problemSo it works for rough stuff for your own use but I wouldnt use it for anything you plan on passing around much Good as a beginning option,neutral

So I went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapestUsing for audio acquisition for film video purposePleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering its made in China Well see how they hold up over timeSo far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a Zoom H4 recorderMy only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side Probably one few out of many lets hopeIts those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in chinaOverall though a great value for a quality cable Quality cable for it being made in China,positive
This strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling The heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through but your know that they are not going to slip back outThe picture does not do it justice I paired it with my black EPI LP and it looks phenomenal I am very impressed with how nice this strap is Beautiful and well made,positive

I own the SN8 which btw is the best tuner Ive ever used I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies violin So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin I was also intrigued by the 34tighter34 tuning aspect of the bars on this Let me tell you if it worked the bars may have been a cool feature but when you are finetuning an A string and it tells you you are on E when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A and it matches the piano then there is a problem I could not find any way to recalibrate the thing so it looks like its just defective The one I received was completely uselessI am amazed at the great SN8I am disappointed in this thing I must have just received a dud I hope since these usually get good reviews but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly On the flip side I will be getting another SN8 in its place since I know those are great tuners I love the one I already have Worst tuner Ive ever used,negative

I heard great things about the S6 and so being a novice without any idea of what to buy I bought it based upon reviews Ive played it for a year and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars here are my humble thoughts The Seagull is comparatively unattractive Its snakehead headstock with the tiny notgreat tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar The cedar top is very nice looking and the rosewood fretboardbridge on mine are very nice The laminate sidesback seem much thicker than competing guitars and this makes the guitar heavier and to me less 34alive34resonant during playing The satinfinished cedar top is very easy to marr The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force but at a heavy strum the top seems to bottom out and lose definition The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing something Ive not encountered before I can get the action very very low before the frets rattle niceAll in all it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because its made in Canada for AsianMexican prices that said just because it comes from Canada doesnt embody it with mystical vibes In fact for the price range I can get a justasgood AsianMexican guitar with a nicer laminate backfront Sitka spruce solid top wood better tuners and a more attractive headstock with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as goodI dont regret getting it but I feel like I overpaid for what I received and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decades exchange rates I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price Seagull to me is overhypedThanks for reading I dont quite like it,negative

Ive had this pedal for about five years I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals including the Boss SD1 TS9 a Klon clone and a bunch of DIY pedals The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons First is the bass and treble controls Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows Second is the mixer out Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a speaker simThe gain sound is ok but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid stateIts built like a tank Cant go wrong for the price IMO Bad As Monkey,positive
Solid construction and well weighted this stand is perfect for desktop use with height adjustments from 85 to 13 and a 6 base per the measurements given on the box The locking diecast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure The color is darker than pictured on Amazon black powder coating Theres no tipping or imbalance to worry about with this mic stand and its reasonably priced I picked mine up for under ten in the Amazon Warehouse It didnt ship with any directions for setup which may or may not be the standard packagingDo take note that this stand has a US standard 58 top I needed a 58 female to 38 male adapter to get my mic to mount to this stand There are a few on Amazon but I found the best deal at another retailer online These are the adapters that Im talking aboutWindtech Adapter 58 Female Standard Microphone to 38 Male You may not need one if your microphone mount ships with one installed which can be easily screwed out to then expose the 58 spaceOverall Im very pleased with the fit finish and construction of this item and Im sure it will work very well for my uses I recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand Stable base and adjustable just what I wanted,positive
This is a very good nicely wide guitar strap Its weathered look is exactly what I was looking for Its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades That is what I wanted but that is also why I got it weathered to speed up about 5 years of personality Im not sure how you would wear it out really Its buttery soft and doesnt have a strange fabric suede backing so it wont muck up your clothes pill or crumbleThe only minus is that its a standard 53 inches though the description says its long Pretty standard vs all other strapsI paired this with my reissue Fender Telecaster Thinline in natural It looks wonderful I can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing itUpdate Since I got the strap as a Christmas gift Ive worn it to class and jam sessions I started getting nice compliments about the guitar Thought the guitar IS beautiful Ive had it for a while I think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar Beauty and Function New but aged broken in look,positive

I purchased this to interface the XLR plug on a Sennheiser E825S mike with the input on guitar amplifiers it seemed to work very well in this role It was wellconstructed with all the connecting points working precisely and securelySomewhat after the fact I started worrying about whether I should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities Im hardly a professional technician in this area but I did do enough research to figure out a good working answer LoZ low impedance microphones say 1000 ohms or less generally do not have to be matched to solidstate amplifiers which are likely to have HiZ high impedance inputs in the range of 10000 ohms These amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 101 impedance ratio load to source I calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 083 decibels which is incidentalThis corresponds to what my ears tell me this adapter works just fine without impedance matching I cant say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if I have a chance to find outUPDATE since I wrote my initial review I have discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws If you purchase this item I suggest you have a microscrewdriver set handy so you can tighten everything up before you discover to your chagrin that a loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector to fall apart No impedance matching required,positive
This little fellow is great The proper connection from the Focusrite comes with the box Hooks to the USB port on my MacBook Pro Everything else plugs right in No hassle with the right jacks and stuff My headphone jack was a different size but I went from 18 to 1434 with a reducer I had on hand I can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program Ive been recording using Garage Band Works great Anytime I can get a product that works as its suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff its a 5 Star in my book Oh There are two ports for speakers on the back side I havent used yet Just trying to decide what speakers to purchase Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Low cost good product no hassle,positive
I am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide this one works fine so far it is rather heavy and I like that I also like that because it is metal if you drop it on the floor it is not going to break like my glass one did Be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger work well for me,positive
Tunes by sound or vibration thats all i use it for the vibration mode is really nice buy one its convenient works great,positive
I generally use Daddario with my acoustic guitar only but I decided to try it out on the electric and I am very satisfied It has the same light feel as their acoustic product but it can make all the sweet tones I want it to when hooked up to an amp Im not sure on how long it lasts because I only put them on the guitar a few days ago but they seem just as perfect as they were when I put them on I would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me Recommended brand recommended strings,positive
Recently I was looking for some heads to put on a set of Starion shells that I modified My original plan was to use a set of Attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells That decision was based mostly on price Not completely though as I have used the Attack heads for resonant heads with very good results The Attack heads that I bought though are single ply To me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but I think a two ply head is better for a batter head I gave the Attacks a shot on both sides but I wasnt completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to goIn the past I have used Remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively I still very much like the Remo Pinstripe heads but decided to give these Evans heads a try just to try something different I am very happy I did These Starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance The most noticeable difference between these G2s and the Attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider The Attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated The G2s seem to resonate everywhere From very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance I have some Moon Gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound By adding removing or moving the Moon Gel pads around I can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tuneI should mention that I am still using the single ply Attacks for the resonant side With the G2s on top and the Attacks on the bottom these shells sound great Also on the bass drum I have Attack no ring heads on both sides I also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing So the Attacks have their place but on the batter side I am very impressed with the sound tuning range and ease of tuning of these G2s If youve never tried them give them a shot if you have you likely already know what Im talking about I may be a convert,positive
They are easier to play on the the medium gauge strings that came with my guitar I am a beginner so although they still hurt my fingers they were an improvement They also have a pretty color to them and the ends of the strings the ones that go in the holes during installation are color coded and come with a chart which makes things easy Nice,positive
Im sold Ive purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals Killer pedal at a killer price,positive
I bought this during the Black Friday sale The price was right since if I was dissatisfied then I wouldnt be out that much moneyQuality product Well worth the purchase I would recommend this Great product,positive
Ive used these at every gig I have run sound at for 2 months and so far they have passed the test with flying colors They allow me to concentrate on other more important things than the reliability of my cables My go to cables,positive
I am not one to spend a lot on batteries so this was a no brainer It has worked great now for over a year at least I had to look it up and I have had this for 3 years tomorrow Good product,positive
This is a very nice looking back plate and for the price its cheep the holes are in the right place for the screws Very nice,positive
The Joyo Ultimate Overdrive is simply a great pedal Tone adjustment is precise The bright switch is an added bonus Having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal Construction is first rate and there is absolutly no hum hiss loss of signal nor any excessive coloring of your signal In short you get 100 drive that has a very broad range to work from Through a tube amp it just extends the sound to levels that were not possible using the amps gain alone Impressive I can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good It just is Im not one to argue over perfection and neither should anyone else that plays guitar and cares about their tone and gear This one is a winner hands downAnd Im not a new player either been at it for nearly 5 decades now I know tone and have had great and not so great gear This one is a keeper It handles everything from easy overdrive to nearly all out metal not a metal pedal though but it gets that drive from those huge amps of the 70s right on the money Versatile Smooth Easy to dial in Whats not to like here Forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal Well worth twice the price,positive
Ive been playing for over 30 years and now have three different electronic tuners so Im a good judge of the SnarkPROS Its chromatic so its good for every tuning job no need to plug it into your jack ambient noise doesnt affect it great sharp colorful display reacts quickly small enough to fit easily in my case cool blue color builtin metronome powers down automatically to save the battery transposes up to four steps if youre using a capo will even identify major chordsCONS Works better on acoustics and semihollows than on solid bodied guitars made me realize that three of my strings need intonating or is that a PRO metronome is visual only manual says that longterm use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars finishes big blue thing on your guitar looks weirdNow that I have the Snark I have officially retired my other two tuners This is easier to use easier to carry around you dont have to unplug from your amp it works on acoustic or electric and its chromatic And its cheap Definitely recommended I retired my other two tuners,positive
this is a solid cable works very well form I can now walk around more with the extension no more limitations Quality is excellent jazzgryl52,positive

The apogee Jam works great and it sounds great The operation is very simple you plug in your guitar and plug in to your Mac or ios device I have mine hooked up to my MacBook running Garage Band If there is any latency I cant hear it It works beautifully Apogee is known for making good music products and this Jam is no exception I was able to plug in a microphone line level into this as well and record my vocals Likewise it worked well with my 4string bass as well I was able to record a whole song in no time For a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable works great no latency,positive
I only use this as a tube amp for vocal For the price I can drive 2 mics and fit it in a 1U space The tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as I dont crank it up too much it also helps with the gain of the SM58 as its much lower than my other Line6 mic I used to have multiple Studio Projects VTB1s and ART Tube Pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age and I mainly cared for the tube feature in them so stepping down to the MIC2200 is fine with meIf you want to get warmer vocal sound and dont want to invest too much for it the MIC2200 is the way to go imo However buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers and hope that they last So Ill update should I encounter problems Good tube amp for a low price,positive
cheaper and as good as if they were original Gibson fit well and look well tune well everything get them hawsome,positive
I put these on my campfire acoustic Black Yamaha F335 and they look stunning The tone seems slightly brighter however I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective sounds goodThese pins are a little thin small so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins This may not be necessary however even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole The string should go all the way through the hole into the body of the guitar Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches if possible it should be listing toward the neck Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while youre trying to get your guitar in tune typically ruining a brand new string in the process If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body correctly or hanging on the pin incorrectly Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installationThese fit my guitar snugly but not tightly however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more sometimes using two fingers strength to bend that far Overall I am quite pleased with these Beautiful bridge pins slightly small but should work with correct stringing,positive
I have a fullyweighted 88key Alesis QS 81 and an MAudio Axiom 61 semiweighted and theyre both fine when Im just playing standalone or recording audio or MIDI But I wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing per se The Alesis is perfect I can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard correctly if that makes sense it makes a clear difference to meI opted for the 25 key strictly for space considerations and while the downup octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use I often wish Id gone for a larger model to get wider voicings I may trade it in for an upgrade at some point but overall Im very happy with the keyboard Great But Consider The Best Size For Your Needs,positive
these have worked great when Ive needed to have 14 input vs the xlrespecially when I bust out the old Tascam 4 track cassettesome times I like recording drums analog versus digital or other instruments helpful,positive
I use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty The sound is unbelievable Thick and creamy sound Lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies Good price Good strings great strings,positive
Studio grade reverbs in a small box if you are looking for a reverb with a lot of options and in a small unit this is it Another 34I cant say enough about it34 pedal from TC Electronics worth checking out if youre looking Outstanding reverb,positive

Ive been playing guitar since the late sixties and have to say this string winder and cutter is fantastic I use it regularly It is durable and effective The Handiest Tool a Guitar Player Can Have,positive
I bought this to complement a 414ceLTD Fall 2011 guitar and wanted to have something that would last a long time and provide a nice suede feel to keep the strap from sliding around on my shoulderIt took a little bit to get the hole over the butt peg of the guitar it almost seemed the slit they cut was too small After working at it a few minutes I got it to fit and it wore really nicely once I got the length where I wanted Taking it onoff the guitar isnt too much trouble but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more enough to make it easier to get it on Im glad that it came a little tighter initially the leather stretches over time and its clear they had that in mind when they make these The quality is excellent and Im buying another one to go with my 12string Taylor Fits a Taylor Grand Auditorium nicely,positive
Been using the snark tuners for while now Functions perfectly Only problem I have is it is small enough that I have trouble finding it sometime So I have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same love it,positive
Its as good as it looks With that in mind its perfect Its not very sturdy if youre using it outdoors and its windy but hey what do you expect from the way it looks Good basic stand,positive
I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a 341 Spot34 brand plug It is not what I received Instead I received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose but a really cheap version The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs great for saving space on a pedal board and the wires are soft and 34rubbery34 again making it easier to work with on a pedal board specially if youre working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug I emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did I can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug wouldnt know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors I strongly recommend spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug This is not a 1 Spot brand 8 plug,negative
I will just say that in my opinion if you are looking for something to take your Taylor to a gig in you are better served with an SKB In a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold However all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars It is well crafted and cheap I use it for my Ibanez Exotic Acoustic Electric A nice guitar but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two Anyway i also store some extra picks my strap and a couple cords in the bag along with a fretboard cloth a set of strings a tuner and an allen wrench for the truss rod All in all great value for a good item Just fine for the average guitar,positive
This is a great tuner for the price it looks slick and is a qualityproduct whetheru r a beginner or in a band this tuner will meet all of your needs great accurate and cheap tuner with clip,positive
I didnt do the sound quality test but i have another one of these and it works just fine I just tested if all the plugs work and they do If ill get some sound problems i will write an update but im confident that its going to be ok It works,positive
I dont play these myself I bought them for my daughter They look kinda flimsy but for the price they are ok for beginners to play Theyre just ok,neutral
Ive been using these Fender straplocks over the last yearFender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster Ive decided to try these because they use a dual system you can use the lock on your strap or just use your regular strap without the locking mechanism Ive only been using these for a week but so far I like them much better than Fenders I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with theseI do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality and the screw heads will strip if youre not careful When I was installing these strap nuts I screw in a half turn at a time and applied lots of pressure so that the the head wont strip If you can get over the installation you got yourself a pretty good locking strap Better than Fenders strap locks,positive
I used a felt pick that was made in the 1940s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable I bought a set of Mahalo Felt Picks and while they seem nice theyre too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and I get a raspy harsh tone when picking single stringsI know many people love these felt picks but Ive found a set of soft rubber picks here on Amazon that give me a tone thats much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick A bit too stiff for my tastes,neutral
Excellent little device for the money Easy to use I have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well This will get you in tune for 11 or less cant beat it Snark SN1 Tuner is well spent,positive
So easy to use Just clip it on and tada The screen is very easy to see and tuning my banjo is a breeze with it Unfortunately my dog thought it was a delicious toy and mauled it beyond recognition so I need to buy another one If your dog loves toys keep this out of reach I love it,positive
Overall this is a pretty good stand It is sturdy and has good adjustable heights A good value if you have lots of stuff you need to hang on it I took one star off because the bottom part is kind of awkward fro holding up the guitar as the guitar strap peg is at the very bottom and is the only thing touching the bottom of the stand which make sit easy to fall and Ive had it fall a number of times Im just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider Also the edges of my guitars are always touching as if there is not enough room for them on the stand Good,positive
There is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voiceover applications It does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone NOTE use a good preamp or a external EQ great buy,positive
The Alpha is a great little interface It accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer Its powered via the USB The 34mix34 knob is a nice feature allowing you to hear your input more or less prominently within the playback mix without affecting the input to the DAW Im using cakewalks Music Creator 6 Touch so I didnt bother to load the LE software it came with I like cakewalks software better anyways just my preference Some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording I havent had a problem with this It is extremely silent save any noise I would generate anyway from my rig All in all I feel this is a great product and definitely worth the money Great Interface,positive
What can I say they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings Ive been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down Unlike some of the higher priced strings I might add Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding Crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get 34mudded34 out I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar Still after all of these years and innovations in strings Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down Great Slinkys as always,positive
I was surprised by the sizevery small and unobtrusive My older guitar has a decal on the top of the head which made the small size a bit of an issue but with the cleverly designed swivel pad and wide opening on the clip of the Snark I could still easily manage itThe tuning is deadon and couldnt be more convenient Since its based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise Also you dont have to try and balance anything on your knee or use a table to hold your standard audio tuner Just clip it on and swivel the head to face youI really like the design Attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice nonslip surface The display is bright and the interface is very intuitiveyou just press the button and start plucking stringsIn addition Snarks customer service was very friendly and helpfulPutting my two cents asidethat anyone who plays the guitar should learn to tune by sound without a tuner given one of the notes I highly recommend the Snark tuner Guitarist musthave,positive
These are by far the best value for effects pedal cables I find the local music stores wont stock them forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about 700 each These cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price We will see how well they stand up over the longterm as they are a cheaper cable But for the price they are great At 6 per pack you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead if that even happens Very happy with this product so far,positive
This set is not for everyone In fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set While I can see rockers laying down overpowering riffs with these my goal is to get the lowest action I can on a jazz box No question about the quality though these hold up the same fine standards as the other Slinky sets Massive,positive
Fit perfect to my Taylor T5 and no cons I can find so far If you want a capo for guitar this one is the one stop shopping for you Solid capo for lifetime,positive
Amazing I plugged this little gadget into my Strat put on my headphones and wow I was super surprised The sound is amazing You can adjust the amount of gain and volume to fine tune your sound whether your playing through humbuckers or single coils I love the sound I get on either my Strat or Les Paul Best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody I plug this little monster into my compressor and from the compressor to the guitar and the sound is amazing I really like the sound and the fact that it is totally portable and independent of power runs on two AAA batteries The digital delay effect is activated independently same little switch just one extra click which is fine but you cant adjust the speed or mix Thats OK though because the factory setting works just fine if you want a touch of delay All in all I highly recommend this Vox AmPlug Lead Guitar Headphone Amp for its sound and price One small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile Wow wow amazing little gadget,positive
These cables work well in my jam space they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in giging but at 13 the price thats fair Dont get me wrong these are good cables and for the price I am very happy Id buy more for sure I would probalby uses these for gigging as well if I didnt have heavier duty jumpers availableAs the title says these are a great value and work well Great price vs value,positive
If you dont know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack Picks make a big difference to sound and playability These are thin and flexible Easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general However the tone is different So youll need to decide what songs they work for etcAs far as quality these are great Easy to grip and as durable as most Good Picks,positive
I was very impressed by this little guitar The build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiselessThe only complaints I have is E string breaks often which is a direct result of constant tuning fatiguing the stringsI feel the tuners are just not strong enough and the ratio is no adequate to keep in tuneStill a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old Good childs guitar hard to keep in tune,neutral
This works great for micing guitar amps The stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp Great Stand,positive

The description says it all but I was still wondering if I made the right choice because I was comparing the Fender Accessories 0990502000 Guitar Tools what the heck kind of name is that anyway with NO reviews to theJim Dunlop NC65 Formula 65 Neck Cradle Maintenance Stationthat had some pretty good reviewsWell I cannot speak for the Dunlop but I can say that this kit is light weight selfcontained has storage space in it and it works if the guitar is faceup or face downIt also has pad to keep your guitar from sliding and the pad keeps the neck rest in place so it does not topple over I do not see anything like that mentioned in the Dunlop NC65On top of it I think the neck rest pad inGuitar Setup Maintenance Instructional Guitar DVD With Denny Rauenis this one turned over so the Fender logo is not showing This is just what I was looking for,positive
I love these picks especially in this gauge They are a bit thinner than the jazz 3s so if you master em you can in theory play faster They have a good grip and a nice texture The tone it gives isnt bad either Probably my favorite picks right now,positive
As a musician you wonder how accessories like a capo which have been around for centuries can be improved Sure enough the Planet Waves Capo has a feature where you can manually adjust the tension When a capo doesnt have enough tension it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing Initially the Planet Waves Capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first I mean shouldnt it just immediately work After I figured out what worked best for my instrument the capo worked like a charm An additional feature of the Planet Waves Capo is that there is a clip for a pick which is handy if you dont already have an attached pick holderI like it and recommend it for those who might move their capo around to different instruments that have varying neck dimensions Capable Capo,positive
What can I say First its MXRenough said This company Dunlop gets it right with the MXR line I was a Boss guy but was never really happy with the delay or chorus from them I dont hate Boss and use their SuperOverdrive in my chain I already own a MXR Dyna Comp Phaser 90 pedal so I took the leap and bought this delay Wow Its so much warmer than the Boss Side by side the MXR won hands downwell at least for me It goes from slapback to space shot very easily Its a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use Im really happy with this and would replace it god forbid Best Delay Pedal I Ever Bought,positive
Great stand for the price Threaded fine and its heavy enough for any mic youve got there are better out there but its a good value good solid stand,positive
Works for my Behringer XM1800S Mics It came with a smaller thread adapter on it already Idk what mics use that but is something to note Why cant their be a Mic stand that can extend from tabletop size to standard,positive
This product was recommended to me by one of the books I am reading and I must admit I was scared to death when I opened the package My guitar has a built in tuner so I found my room mates guitar that was totally out of tune and just began tuning I remembered 34Eddie Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddie34 and just tuned away It was easy easy easy and I realized what to do within mere moments Money very well spent and highly recommended I have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings I found what I was comfortable with and just tuned to standard Could not be any happier Get this product New player never tuned anything before this is the way to go,positive
My 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks They are good and reasonably priced The principal is mad at me because I told them that a real drummer plays constantly so the walls in the halls cafeteria tables and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly Good sticks,positive

Since as of right now this is the only review of this product on amazoncom Ill try to answer any questions you might have about the EHX Pocket Metal Muff Pedal This pedal is the model of simplicity a volume control a distortion control and a switch that changes the amount or lack thereof of midscoop Thats doesnt leave much room for tone tweaking so tweakers beware That being said ElectroHarmonix did a commendable job of presetting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amps eq to get it right where you want it Playing through my Fender hotrod deville amp I was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded The bass was powerful and chunky great for heavy metal palmmuting riffs the treble had a good bite but it wasnt harsh and all three midrange modes sounded great depending on the application Want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone Just leave the midswitch on the flat setting Want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good allround metal tone Move the switch down to the low midscoop mode Do you want to play Master of Puppets by Metallica The high midscoop mode is calling your name This pedal offers quite a bit of distortion but I was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels my tone remained clear and defined It didnt turn into a plasticy fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals cough metal zone cough will I will mention that this pedal isnt the best if youre looking for a more modern metal tone You wont get a slightly fizzy ultragain think Slipknot sound out of this pedal Rather it offers a very crunchy defined roar more characteristic of the predual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiersIn conclusion I give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well this version of the metal muff line isnt designed to be highly versatile and tweakable in and of itself get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3band eq and a boost function This pedal is designed to be a very simple small box of pure classic metal tone and thats exactly what it accomplishes A lot of classic heavy metal tone in a small package,positive

Enjoyable mic has a decent frequency response range nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise I usually have to do some postprocessing on vocals but in the genres I work in thats not exactly a rare thing Either way sounds way better than I would expect for a mic at this price Havent tried it for drums or guitar yet but Im impressed with its ability to accurately capture vocals While it doesnt have the warmth that some mics relay I prefer it that way It leaves a really clean if slightly coldflat feeling that can then be warmed up in post production nicelyGood value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount Though make sure to be cautious with your mic placement get a pop filter and if you have a room with lots of ambient noise dont be shocked if it picks some of it up All in all a good deal Does what it needs to do,positive
Ive owned Loop Stations DM4s Jam Mans Samplers and all that jazz Theyre all full of crap you dont need This pedal has flawless colorless sound quality It records what you sound like You click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers Smallest Cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use then dont get this one but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this Best loop pedal for the money,positive
These sell for about 2025 in the real world I paid a bit over 12 and it was an Amazon Prime purchase too The display is better than most Ive used dating back 30 years The best thing is that I can pass this around to band members quickly when they have a need too Where was this all my life,positive
Great deal for the price Works fine but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric Did the job for what I needed Now I know I would love a better one like a Fishman Not bad,positive
I had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that I almost sent it backBut with a little trial and error I figured it outThat said this thing is ROCK SOLID I was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a 700 iPad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip Great product bad instructions,positive

does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating werks,positive
After you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself34why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually34 I used to devote so much time to sitting there winding forever by hand With this winder you are done in an amazingly short time It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts that on the bottom 34E34 I did a double take it is almost invisible Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one Restringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread Not at all Super nice,positive
although im not onstage bouncing aroungthey hold the strap on just fineno changing hardware like strap locksyesmore colors so they would stay hidden would be nicebut i will order more seems to work just fine for me,positive
From the other reviews I wasnt sure what to expect but this is a nice stand for the money I use it and my granddaughter uses it as well It is sturdy easy to fold away and easy to setup The leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand A nice stand for the price,positive
This is an amazing guitar for the price I wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection The guitar has good tone and action The built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently The guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in The pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud The guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but I prefer the acoustic sound The finish is a bit more orange than pictured You could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one Great guitar for the price,positive
Nice solid no frills guitar strap I used this on my stupid heavy Agile guitar and it helped a lot Great price solid strap,positive
This is a very reasonable price for this bag I got it for my les paul epiphone uke The fit is fine This bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke Ill just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesnt have one Good for the price,positive
These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean Very forgiving on technique also Great for beginners Perfect for strumming,positive
Love this stuff I have been using it for years and it always does the job well Cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent Cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine Polish that Axe,positive
I like the overall design of this mount although it would be nice to have a little bit more articulation The best thing is that I can leave my ipad in the LIFEPROOF case for performances so I dont have to worry about water sweat or other various liquids and beverages hurting my main daime my ipad I use my ipad for almost everything these days and I certainly cant see going back to a lyric book after using the ipad and the SET LIST MAKER app Then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages iBooks etc it is a great tool for gigging musicians and this mount gets it up where you can see it Best thing Ive bought for my ipad in a while Works with LIFEPROOF Case,positive
First things first this is a fuzz pedal and on the heavy side which mean it provides thick ground shaking distortion and sustain This is very different from normal distortion so noise is to be expected whether you are playing or notSecond a true bypass switch like in the Big Muffis a mechanical switch as opposed to Boss type pedals that have buffers which color your sound even when they are off Mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they areOk so now to the actual sound which is amazing This pedal has a tone of versatility because not only do you have a lot of options on the pedal itself but it reacts dynamically to the knobs on your guitar Since I play a Les Paul with 57 classics I will often turn the volume down to 8 when using this otherwise the bass can be overwhelming but awesome Strat and Tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils In addition the Wicker and Tone features all for more sounds that just the original Big Muff or you can just turn them off to get the original soundGreat for Black Keys they use a big muff Weezer think My Name is Jonas certain Greenday songs and basically anything where you need thick and deep fuzz with the option to tone it down if need be World Class Fuzz for under 100,positive
I keep ordering more of these picks I love the rubber grip and the mediums are just the right thickness for me Great product LOVE THESE,positive
DAddario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars and now my two mandolins Consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand Consistent and goodsounding,positive
These are good quality strings that will last on your guitar for many months to come Probably my second favorite after Ernie Ball Good quality,positive
Perfect retrofit for my 1989 American Strat The locking mechanism is strong No problems at all I like to stay brand loyal so I honestly think these tuners will go on the rest of my Fender collection Tuning is a breeze and is very stable You Have to Love Locking Tuners,positive
Quality tuners overall I like the look and feel of these The only complaint I have is that after 34locking34 the strings the tuners loosen slightly a short while later So I have to continually check that they are indeed still lockedAll in all though very good for the price Excellent overall,positive
I have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myselfA couple of secrets to installing the mike pickupAfter you drill the hole and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar do thisGet a guitarpatch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole jack into the AXL and then pull it out the hole using your cable You may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help Also I did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothingFinding a sweet spot on smaller guitarsukulelemandolins can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small you cant get your hand in and finger length is as far as you can go so in most cases go in the direction of the low E string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have Jimi Hendrix hands and in that case congratulationsFinally on Travel guitars GET RID OF THE GIANT STRINGS THAT COME ON SOME OF THESE THINGSMy SX traveller came in with 1154s and I could not even hear the low E string I had an old set of electric 1046s I took off of a BB King Lucille and just for the heck of it swapped them out Man what a difference actually so much difference that I really didnt need the AXL I just installed even though its a fun additionAs far as an amp I have a little HoneyTone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal and just may have found a home as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the Travel guitar Installed on SX Traveller,positive
Broke one of my Snark tuners when I kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided I needed a tuner I could keep on any guitar while it was in any casePros Fits on any guitar which then fits in any case Cheap AccurateCons Calibration button and onoff button are same shape same size and on the same tiny surface Very easy to hit the wrong one Not great poor viewing angle for 3onaside tuners works better for 6 inline tuners Not as easy to read as the SnarkOther thoughtsI only use this on a guitar that I play for only one song at shows because the song requires two capos and a detuned string dont ask I much prefer the Snark but apparently I cant be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away Idiot At shows I rely on a tu2 stompbox for tuning Basically this is a niche tuner Its so stinking small and thats what counts Super awesome small but poor button design,positive
Great unit for the price It offer a lot of variations in echo delay typesIt is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece Even so would nothesitate to use that way I cant say what battery life is as only use withan AC adapter The EM600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps I drive mine sometimes with the Behringer AB box using one ofthe 2 preamp gain controls or the Behringer Tube Amp ModelerOnly downside is the settings type control for echo delay types is a bithard to read without getting close to it especially in dim lightingThis isnt really a big deal though and often dont put the EM600 on the floor Behringer EM600 Echo Machine,positive
Very nice leather strap I will like it better when it is worn in and softer but excellent for holding the weight of a five string bassI very much recommend it along with some Dunlop straploks Nice Wide Axe Holder,positive
I cant say Im a polish connoisseur but this stuff seems to work very well It shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks Im not very diligent in my guitar maintenance so this bottle should last me for years It shines up my geetar prettily,positive
this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost 4 tom 5 times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one great little pickup,positive
I have a HEAVY Epiphone EB0 bass and this strap is a lifesaver Nice thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky The little pocket for the pick is not too practical though because the pick easily falls out and is lost Perfect for Heavy Bass Guitar,positive
The tuning is accurate the LCD screen is clearly visible it works great Im not sure about battery life I havent gotten there yet GREAT PRODUCT,positive
I got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin Do they sound as good as a 5K Gibson F5 Not hardly Do they sound good for a 4050 dollar Chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find Actually yeah they do This is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so I wouldnt worry about that When you get it the action is likely to be high and if you cant lower the bridge enough with the wheels its easy enough to sand some off the bottom Also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash Just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something Decent strings dont cost very muchDepending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable after you fix the bridge and strings little instrument The hardware isnt the best and the tuners suck but hey if youre just starting out tuning is part of the gameFor 4999 and Ive seen new ones 10 bucks less from time to time its worth the investment You can spend more on dinner and a movie and after you ate and watched the flick its gone With the money spent here youll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening My 7 year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it so far so good Its been holding up wellBTW if 4999 breaks you and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin been there since youre here reading this that means youre on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going after that you can find MANY good bookscdsdvds that will help you along even further and one day youll get a better instrument Im actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so I dont take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever and if I get cold and run out of wood these are almost cheap enough to burnOne thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these If you go to certain online classifieds CL coughcoughcough youll notice people ask 50 bucks or MORE for these sometimes over 100 USED Same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new This is one of the few cases where Id buy new over used If you decide to sell it and as long as its not in pieces itll still bring 2030 bucks used so you wont be out much but really its a good servicable instrument with a little work but if youre lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it Again though not that big a deal to fix if its notOh as stated elsewhere these dont have trussrods Thats not bad in itself Youd be surprised how many mandolins didnt have them years ago and alot of them are still around Even from some big makers If the neck warps in a year or two no big deal you got your moneys worth Mines been kicking around for awhile and the last year a 7 year old 6 at the time has been beating on it and I can still pick it up tune it and play it Good entry level starter mandolin,positive
Ever notice how every youtube video has pedals being demoed with either a Strat or a Tele We we can debate why that is but one thing for certain is it is tough to get an accurate idea of what an LP will sound like till after you unbox it After hours of research I decided on the FD2 since it seemed to have a lot of tuning options and I actually found a review using an LP into a clean ampEssentially you get 3 modes which have varing degrees types of OD and a second boost mode to push things even father What I liked about this pedal is you can use the comp cut or flat mids with an LP and not increase the bottom end or mids which often Teles or Strats need Hence you can go from slight boost to huge gain without turning into mud like some pedals will do The only downside is with so many options you will constantly be playing with the knobs and switches and finding new sounds Works fantastically with modeling amps which need varying amounts of clean and dirty OD depending on what you are modeling One of the Best OD Pedals for Les Pauls,positive
To my ears this is a SM58 It sounds identical Someone with super human ears will tell you otherwise and they may be right but I have been recording music for years and this mic is as good as any shure mic I have had and its only half or less of the cost This is basically a SHURE clone,positive
Good for any beginner but consultation with a teacher if you have one is recommended For ham fisted persons positioning is not easy for lossening strings proper bridge resetting and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required Measuring requires a hard ruler with a full 330 milimeters 325 required bet you dont have one or a technicians measuring tape and confident measuring skill Measuring is best with a cooperative assistant Bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the D string to hold the bridge position measurement check tightening the A string measurement check removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the 1st and 4th strings and tuning the instrument Do it Youll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing If you aint intelligent Good Luck Youd best be served with dot stickers Violin Finger Positioning guide,positive
For many years Ive been playing with Proel and 34Fender34 cables until I start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency This guys put an end to the problem with high quality components Best of all Warranty For Life or maybe longer Best Cable EVER,positive
I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldnt call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory one cannot complain too much Now that mine has just run dry Im going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that Ive just discovered called The Swipe which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals If this works as well as advertised I may still get FastFret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortableRecommended Very Useful Accessory For String Instrumentalists,positive
Its a bit thinner than the average cableNot as thick as I would like but works well and its kind of nice and slick to put away Very smooth Smooth,positive
This tuner is wonderful You can tune all strings in same time Its halpfull in stage because you dont need to test each string individually Its a great tunner,positive
Upon arrival I was astonished With a box as monstrous as the one this little number arrived in I was expecting a ukulele made for Andre the GiantIts not quite as big as the packaging leads one to believe but the sound sure isThe unplugged tone is warm and sweet like the most delightful brownie you could ever imagine Plugged in it really shines I paired mine with a Pignose 7100 for street performing and while it is a bit too chilly to play for nickels at the moment I have no doubt this will pay for itself in the long runI was slightly surprised at how slim the body is similar in scale to an actual Les Paul as I was expecting a fuller body but it doesnt hurt the playability a bitThe finish is gorgeous and the little stickon pickguard is just too adorable for wordsIf youre hemming and hawing over getting one just do it Youll be oh so pleasantly surprised Holy Bajeezus,positive
I love the Hola small instrument stand It is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when I go to the Ukulele Club It has a nice rubber padding so I trust putting my instrument on it I have a Tenor Ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand It is very lightweight which is also a plus I use the stand at home too I stand my ukulele on it because sometimes I play and then I want to go to YouTube to listen to a particular song It is very convenient I have recommended this stand to others alsoFeatures I like lightweight sturdy and folds up easily Great Stand,positive
Does everything youd expect it to do as well as a couple of things you might not likeFirst when run before the amp it adds a bit of treble to the tone and a hint of distortionNot to the point of being unusable but you guys playing with the 34Fender clean34 tone might notice I certainly didPlaying with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagineIve noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop the treble boost distortion isnt there or at least not noticeable In my experience of course YMMVThose are minor complaints though as the pedal works well has more than adequate delay times up to 600ms and is built wellI strongly suggest using this with a 9v adapter because this pedal will eat a 9v battery in a matter of minutesOverall its a great deal No its not as pristine a delay as a Carbon Copy or Boss DD but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals and I doubt anyone but you will notice the difference Great delay for the money,positive
I just received these cables today and the packaging they come in is quite simple However there are two zip ties that secure the cables together so you will need to be careful when cutting them not to damage the cable itself with your knife or scissorsThese are Value cables after all However they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use I like how Audio Technica made something like an XLR cable look so pleasing to the eyesAs for quality so far Ive been getting a clean signal even with my cheap Pyle Pro PDMIC58 I had to replace the cable that came with that mic because it was really that awful Hopefully the AT Value cable will hold up Ill update this review if anything happensIf your looking for a decent cable for a low price I would give these a try Good cables for the price,positive
This Behringer compressor sustainer compares to the Boss CS2 the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone compression level is very good and all for 2500 not putting down the Boss but for this price you cant go wrong This is it,positive
I used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month I bought three of these Dunlop Pick Holders one for each of the three gauges I find myself constantly using and theyve more than paid for themselves in the short time Ive had them The Little GoTo Lifesaver,positive
I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke The body is 2 inches wide less than the 275 inches stated for this stand My uke does not fit well in the stand Why The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke Thus any uke that is concert size or greater So most ukes dont fit well They fit just not wellI did and you will likely need this advice remove the bottom fork turn it upside down and reinstall it no tools required Now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it The fit is improved Not great but better One stand cant fit all instruments but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars This small stand does not hold most all ukesAlthough its neat how it folds up like the video here on Amazon reviews it is very heavy for its size This is not a lightweight stand At all Surprisingly heavy and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag trust meI wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand All Hercules stuff is superb and my friend has one for his uke and says its sublime I dont own it myself so I just present this so you can research it and its reviews on Amazon I own other Herc stuff and its all ideal and for a few bucks more I could have had that lifelonguse stand instead of this one Oh well for once I got cheap And got burned for itAll in all not great this tiny stand One stand fits NOT all Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments You may think you can bend the lower forks but its hard to do will require a vice and if you see on the Amazon pictures the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves so if you splay it out like it should be youll change the way it fits in the grooves and thus it wont work at all Its just an imperfect design My take on it your mileage may vary Bye bye Not ideal Lower fork too narrow and small bad design,negative
great stand well made safe for ur guitar and practical w safety cord on top worth getting it this is one of the better stands out there cuz its well made and great cushined for ur guitar and with a great price cisco2fun1youtubecom,positive

Not my first Intellitouch tuner I really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar Really good tuner,positive
I prefer woven cables for looks They have a nice stage presence Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables I dont move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but thats OK for me and Im sure it will wear well if you move around on stage Good quality,positive
This is handsdown the best tuner Ive ever owned The Snark SN8 works extremely well and being chromatic works on every stringed instrument I own guitar bass banjo violin no matter what key the instrument is tuned to I still use my Korg Pitchblack inline with my bass also a very nice product but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong This little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle just as it should be Ive personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners It simply does its job and does it very wellAlso buying this item from Amazon saved me quite a bit over the local Guitar Center which is always a big plus It feels tough too this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around which is a very good thing Despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping the product arrived intact and fast I would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in Fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition no thanks to that paper envelope seriously they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or somethingI could not be happier at least until I buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag Best Tuner Ive Ever Owned,positive
This transfers my XLR mic to my USB laptop Simply plug it in and find the right drivers My only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic It does seem like it can break easily Thankfully I will never have to move it around much on my desk All in all it works and I am pleased Works for what it is,positive
Restrung my guitar with no problems These were my first set of new strings so I dont really know what to fuss about hen comparing strings but these seem to work fine and have a great tone I can really hear the difference between new and old strings The strings are nice and smooth and springy very easy to press on Great,positive
I got a pair of these strings in early august i still have them but being as doubtful as i am i just bought an extra pair from this seller who shipped amazingly fast it got here in about 3 daysany ways the strings stay bright for a long time donthave not lost there color yetrusted after a little more than four monthsand they are everything a guitar player looks for in strings i do a lot of string bends and these have just held up to it I have a BC Rich SOB Avenge so i cant tell you what its like with a tremolo but i just like them I have tried out GHS First act Dunlop and Daddarios and these are the only ones that have last for so long with out showing any signs of significant wear Good strings,positive
Look at the price because this thing really sounds good Its no toy its a real Retro Electric Guitar Effects Pedal Im very happy with this purchase Distortion Effects Pedal,positive
DAddario strings are like the Kias of the string world They make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time These strings are OKIve always been partial to Nickel wound particularly semiflatwound but I digress My typical strings are Elixirs so Im used to them lasting a long time In this case the strings sound goodlike most nickel strings do But they didnt last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless and stopped keeping intonation accurately So like most DAddario strings Sotheyre not bad but dont expect them to last like Elixirs do You get what you pay for OK butstill DAddarios,neutral
Bought it for using Danelectro mini amp so I dont need to worry about the battery It works perfectly as an adaptor should be you wont have any surprise by its performance two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp less than 20 the adaptor is pricy 850 but it still saves me for the long runs Using it for Danelectro Mini Amp,neutral
I recently purchased a Vox Mini3 G2 modeling amp to go with my new Mainland Tenor acousticelectric ukulele It was my first electric instrument and I immediately fell in love with the combination ukeampA little time went by and I began wishing I could plug my 5 other nonelectric ukuleles and 3 guitars into my amp I see DIY pickup sets are pretty inexpensive but I didnt really want the expense times eight or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instrumentsThen I stumbled on this Cherub pickup For about the cost of lunch at McDonalds it seemed I might 34electrify34 on the fly whatever instrument I cared to pickup So I bought itBottom line is that it works very well for my needs And although I dont have a very critical ear I think I can hear a slight qualityclarity difference between the builtin pickup on my Mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments but thats not a surprise and such a small difference that I dont much care So far Ive been clipping it into the sound holes but I might try it on the headstock as others have recommendedIf youre a RockGod dont even consider this why would you anyway But if youre a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while this Cherub is for you Surprisingly Good,positive

i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love i decided to replace the saddle with this one and it required some dremelingsanding to get it to sit correctly it was easy to do and now my guitar has no buzzing on any of the frets and it sounds great with new strings it also brightened up the saddlebridge because my old saddle was turning yellow and not too nice looking this one is an ivoryish color and it is really nice awesome,positive

Holy buckets of tone batmanLet me start by saying Im always on the quest for great amazing tone I think it ends here This pedal is absolutely remarkable Built like a tank Im pretty sure it will out live me Its full of sonic optionsThe overdrive has a level tone and overdrive Almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an EQ which is a total plus in my book it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes The comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end the fm is really transparent and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange biteYes this may be another tube screamer clone but its a darn great oneThe added MOSFET circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your lowend fattening it up if thats your cup of tea while the standard leaves it more transparent You should know this switch does effect the whole signal not just that of the boost sideOn to my only negative check on this pedal the boost ONLY works when the OD is on It is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive just additional circuitry to add more gain to your OD signalAnother great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v18vRunning at standard 9v gets you easier breakup whereas 18v will get you more headroomThis pedal wont be leaving my board probably ever If youre even thinking about it just do it Youll never regret it Ill own this pedal for years to come,positive

I got mine and I gave it a try here are the conclusions1 It looks really good sturdy and well made2 Is super stable I tried it out with 2 Strats and a electro acoustic then removed one Strat and placed another acoustic a 12 string this time I pushed the stand and It holds As guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitarbass or whatever you put in there falls down3 You can set the height always considering that your guitars dont reach the floorSo Totally recommended Is really good,positive

I have many socalled travel size acoustic guitars and have changed out all of the over sized strings that were installed on them typically 1254s with these 1047s or 1152s for beefy 78 and 34 scale guitars in all cases has brought the smaller guitars from duds to nice playing instrumentsThree radical samples come to mind On an old 1931 Gibson L1 the 1254s pulled the bridge outOn an SX Traveler you could not hear the Low E until I got rid of the 1254sOn my Lil Martin the lower bout started to delam under the pressure of the bridge pullShort scale acoustic guitars are someplace between a full size acoustic and a Ukulele and in most cases are not set up for heavier gauge strings even though the manufacturers insist on delivering them this way due to their short scales small frets and light constructionIf you cant hear the low E or you are having problems fretting your strings try these what can it hurt Best strings for parlor size or travel acoustics,positive

Bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones I first saw it in a big box musicians store while there was a blues guitar session going which is a public jam session open to anyone They had a lot of tube Fender amps plugged in I was surprised when I plugged into this amp away from that group turned it up and started playing It sounded just as good as those other amps The two employees that worked there and two other customers couldnt believe where the sound was coming from even the other players checked it out I dont understand how Fender has managed to keep this amp a secret for so long poor marketing maybe I dont know but if you want a blues or bluesrock amp with some great vintage tones check these out Pick up a used oneThey sound like a tube amp because essentially they are The amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tinlike Has GREAT overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models A couple of the Marshall settings arent bad either This amp sounds better than the Super Champ to my ears tried this out at the store as well which makes sense since its a class A amp as opposed to class B warmer and more articulateThe speaker is decent but this amp also sounds great using an external speaker cabinetFor home jamming and recording blues without driving everyone nuts this amp is a Godsend Check one out and youll want it Great Blues Amp and More,positive
The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built They were right It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs and based on the design of the stand it will stay where its put One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack probably around half of the thickness of a chord book although heavier as it is steel with a rubber tread on top It feels like I will own this for a long time a well priced good valueEdit22013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new I recommend it highly Great foot rest and good value,positive
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord I ordered both at the same time other than that they are good hot mics Very Satisfied,positive
Worked out of the package and was cheap Longevity yet to be seen It is short but if that is want you need it will do the job Great match for your bedroom amp So far so good,positive

Germany Company manufacturing is in China I have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two Behringer products that are in my hands are very good This one is awesome,positive
It fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protectionStorage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picksYou can8217t fit a full sheet of paper or an 858221 x 118221paper back guitar book in the zipper compartmentI would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarCross straps work well for carrying Zipper system works wellIt is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the priceIt fits my Jasmine ES31C Dreadnought AcousticElectric Guitar just fineYou really cant beat it for the price Not for expensive guitars but it works well,positive
This is a wonderful item that really works Arrived fast Having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards This makes a great gift item Real fun gadget,positive
Okay just strung these up and ran them through three different amps and about 25 different pedals metal overdrive echo reverb fuzz etc So keep in mind that they havent broken in yet as I do this review But I do feel confident in what I report hereThey are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels On the high gain metal muff fullbore guytone metal monster swollen pickle and big muff they sound really nice a lot of harmonics and output captured For that 5 stars easy I dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold Others may feel differently I am sure Then again Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output So you are getting what they sayHowever for a warm bluesy tone I couldnt get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels For that 15 star Average to 3 I guess Forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment For shredding go cobalt for warmwoman tone go PURE nickels thats PURE folks I also really like the daddario puresAlso these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel Hope this helps a little too bright and high output for classic rockblues good for metal,neutral
So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack There are exactly as described and do the job What more can a guy say about a little box of screws Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action Yep they are rack screws,positive

Ive been using a One Spot to power a Gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now In that time Ive done probably over 200 gigs and Ive never had a problem Is it super quiet No but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups there will be noise Its a fact of life Ive never found it to be excessive Turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when youre not playingI would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard Great cheap way to power your pedalboard,positive
I picked up an old Boss ME6B that required the Boss BRA120 power supply That thing outputs 12vAC It also has a different size connector Being that those wallwart power supplies go for around thirty dollars I wasnt interested So instead I spent ninety more dollars on this fuel tank and got a DC Power Plug 55x21mm to 63X30mm female adapter Using the 12vAC output on my Fuel Tank Chameleon works great Awesome overkill solution It also powers everything else and looks fine doing it Works great and solved my Boss ME6B power problem,positive
To me theres not too much depth you can go into when describing guitar picks Either they feel good in your hand or they dont Either they kind of 34disappear34 when youre playing or they feel like a hindrance These Dunlops get it just right Enough grip to where youre not fumbling all over the place and they somehow get out of the way of your playing Theyre right up there with the Fender Classic picks as my alltime favorites to use Tried And True And An Excellent Value Through Amazon,positive
For 3 dollars this is a great quality capo it works perfectly dont waste your money on a Planet Waves or Dunlop or whatever save 10 bucks and buy this Good Cheap Capo,positive
By recommendation from the Acoustic tech people I purchased this for my Acoustic 300B Unfortunately it was the Wong switch BUT626262It has true FENDER quality Well built Heavy duty construction The switches are rock solid This switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action Rubber no skid bottom is a plus I KEPT the switch because of the quality I know It will come in handy sooner or later Wrong one,positive
I am a beginner guitarist I am happy with this capo It works good and that is all I need The fit and finish seems like quality also Good capo for a beginner,positive
A very good pedal that you miss only when its off Super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables To my ears it restores the high end and shimmer and brings back life to the note Best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp Must have in your signal chain,positive
I got this guitar for my 9 year old son He loves it This is a buitifull clasic guitar with a good clear sound when he is not messing with the knobs I would definatly purchase this again Exelent Guitar,positive
great strings and they last well ive never had a problem with these and im glad i can get them on here for a decent price great strings,positive
I have seen people complain about battery life I turn it on tune and then turn it off and my batteries last forever The display is good and the tuners work well I have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity I think it is a well made product and good value Thank god for tuners There is nothing worse than a bunch of outoftune loud guitar players Works Well For Me,positive
This is a very versatile tuner I use it all the time to check my instruments and keep things sounding good Highly recommend this product Great tuner,positive
Unit is sturdy Lots of good presets and capabilities Works with downloadable XEdit software That gets confusing a bit because the unit displays one thing the computer screen another I havent mastered it yet and after a month am just knocking about and settling on sounds that are acceptable but far from ideal Ive see much easier software that puts all effects on screen as stomp box graphics and you build a sound With the XEdit you call up a canned sound and start changing it The interface does not match the RP 255 and has a lot more provisions The thing is they get to be a bit overwhelming at least to me I got this for Christmas and would shop around a lot more Perhaps I wind up choosing this but so far eh For one thing plugging headphones into it the output isnt as loud as Id like I kinda demands output to another devicemixeramp if you want to play loud Well built Software harder than it needs to be Pedal idiosynchratic,neutral
These sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to reportHad to make adjustments to eliminate buzzingThey sound OK OK,neutral
This was my first foray into home recording and it comes with Audacityfor free Free is free and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction The interface is noisy and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc Sent it back after one day You do get what you pay for,negative
I bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes I record the notes dont bend easilyif you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quicklythese are little more than toys compared to 40 dollar harps they feel cheap but have a decent sound i dont know if they will last but to make harp noises without decent bends Ill use these sparinglyJim Do Not Be Fooled These are just little more than toys,negative
Shipped in time Just what I have expected looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars Easy to screw it on the wall Just fine,positive
Installed on two guitars and I love them I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off Great product would recommend to any guitar player Great strap locks for any guitar,positive
Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot connectors seem to be heavy duty time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time Great Cable,positive
Years ago I owned an original edition TS808 I loved that pedal and used it for years on stage Eventually I sold it many years later but I always missed that pedal so I decided to give this reissue a try My verdict Awesome It sounds just like I remember The TS808 just has that certain something that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound especially when its to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have Just like the old days,positive
They look nice and do the job perfectly well The price is not too bad The colours help with organization Works Great,positive
If you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely But its a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall It has a tendency to completely freeze up and the onoff switch does nothing You have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again Get your reading glasses on,negative
I was doing research on a new guitar rig and I kept seeing this amp mentioned Almost all of the reviews I read were positive I decided to order it for a home practice amp when I dont want to dig out my main rigThe build quality is solid it feels like a much more expensive amp Many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed I was really impressed with the packaging the documentation and the build of the amp This is my first Fender amp and probably not my lastThe sound quality is amazing Being a heavier rockmetal player I would never have chosen a Fender amp even for home practice The first channel has a wonderful clean tone and the second channel has several modeled amps The tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain There is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too There are a ton of Youtube videos of people demoing the sounds of this amp so I wont go much further into thisThe included effects are simple but pretty cool as well and can be switched on and off via the optional foot switchOverall Id say that this is a great amp for the price and like many others I highly recommend it Superb sounding high quality amp,positive
This pop filter is built like a tank compared to those cheap cloth and plastic versions that you get at the discount music stores so its a bit more expensive but the quality and functionality is like night and day I use it in front of my Shure Beta 58A and its absolutely perfect Very nice you get what you pay for,positive
If all youre looking for is an inexpensive way to hang your guitar until you can afford a good quality leather strap this is it The quality and function of the strap is actually better than I expected for the amount paid Excellent bargain,positive

This strap is a great strap It is comfortable It is adjustable It just looks great I have not used the pick holder yet great,positive
I was going to get the plate with the big F on it but I read complaints that it was very thin so I kept looking I took a chance and got this one and it was a good call This one is very thick and solid like its supposed to beGreat product great price Fender neck plate,positive
I play Guitar for the first time i have a head set that the drivers are not being over driving giving a distorted sound The calrity is amazing Great Clarity,positive

Works great with my Fender Super Champ X2 amplifier However it does not come with a cable I would highly recommend Good Footswitch,positive
As the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all Its comfortable and sturdy What else could you want in a guitar strap Been using for 8 weeks and am very happy with this strap,positive
This little amp kicks major ass dood I think I may have blown the speaker or its just how it sounds but its great for a lofi kind of fuzze tone when the gain and levels are all the way up The clean tone is really nice too a little to bright for my taste but for a miniclip amp its not too bad I can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away Theres a headphon jack a 9v power supply and thats in for plug ins No line in so you cant plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well If you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great Pretty solid for the price,positive
It looks nicer than pictured seems solid and wellconstructed but most important of all it sounds fantastic Ive only had this amp now for roughly a day but stayed up a good part of last night playing I couldnt stop This morning I opened the outside doors and cranked it all the way up to about half volume Scared the cat and made the dog wonder what the heck that new thing is making all the noise Beyond the halfway setting it wouldve hurt my ears Yes its that loud Absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and smallevent purposes So far Ive only played through the amber presets and only experimented some with the modulations knob I like the bluesy tubeeffect modelings the most and dont know that Ill see much need to go looking to create a lot of custom settings But its nice to know this amp can deliver either with or without the additional FUSE software such an incredibly diverse array of sounds should the need ever arise Thanks Fender Looks and sounds fantastic,positive

I got this in the mail a week ago and have played with it constantlythere is so much in this little box i was just interested in the drum tracks in it when i bought it but i have since stopped using all of my other effects and just used this i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar THIS THING IS FUN,positive
the sleek design is just great as the product does not hinder your hands and fingers while fretting a chord holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless what i really like is that the padded material is very forgiving and holds the strings without any fret buzz and never damages my guitars it is also just great to 34hang34 on the headstock went not in use good stuff,positive
In my opinion this is the best guitar volume pedal available It is affordable and does exactly what its supposed to and does it very very well I might add Ive tried numerous volume pedals from Morley to Line 6 to the Dunlop DVP1 and none are as fluid or feel as good as the Ernie Ball JrI owned the Dunlop DVP1 for several months and while it did an okay job of cutting the volume I simply did not like the feel nor the low volume levels It felt way too bulky under foot and went from about 0 to about 3 when barely applying volume This is unacceptable when youre trying to clean up your distortion channel or trying to accomplish a slow volume swell But as soon as I laid the Ernie Ball down and plugged it in I fell in love Not only does it feel great under your foot and provide precise control it has a complete volume sweep Add in some delay and it will give you an organtype swell Absolutely perfectIve heard some people complain about the Ernie Ball Jr being a flimsy pedal but I just dont see this Of course its not a tank like the Dunlop or Morley but it still feels very solid Its also lighter than the others mentioned which is a plus for traveling musiciansI would HIGHLY recommend this pedal It is one of my favorites on my board and I couldnt imagine playing without it The Best Guitar Volume Pedal,positive
Great replacement string for your ukulele great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku great strings,positive
I agree with all of the reviews but have found another area to use fast fret on THE NUT When tuning the strings especially the lower wound strings hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced Another use,positive
DAddario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price Their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and I have yet to find a better buy Good strings good price,positive
Will be getting the amp in a day or two At the sale price of 119 this cant be beat My research on this device said that to make the really good little solid statetube hybrid even more awesome is to replace the JJ 12AX7 with a Mullard Blackburn vintage 12AX7 from the 1960s It can cost around 3050 a piece for a NOS new old stock but will sweeten the sound without adding or subtracting noticeable gain In the end the Micro Terror should sound just like real tube amps costing many hundreds more1st UpdateTook delivery and hooked it right up to my Marschall 412 into the 16 Ohm jack Volume at about8 oclock and gain at about 3 oclock Man what a great sound Very tubey Typical British growl at higher gain settings Loud Plenty loud for your bedroomofficewhatever Turning it up a bit should be more than enough for a gig at a bar Just be sure to use a GOOD QUALITY SPEAKER CABLE like the GLS Will be updating when I get the vintage 12AX7 tube replacement So far I am very impressed Honestly with a sound this good why buy a TH30 for 5 times the price Measured how loud this thing is At about 3 feet in front of my Marshall 1960 lead 4x12 with gain at max and volume at a bit less than 8 oclock I got around 84 decibels playing strong but not super strong chords This is too loud for most apt buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones2nd UpdateTried out several compatible tubesie 12AY7 12AT7 and the Mullard 12AX7 Each will have a subtle or more obvious effect sound is such a subjective thing you really have to try this out for yourself I personally found the Mullard to be the best Really nice tube sound typical Orange sounds as good as most amps costing several times as much Preliminary rating based on 10 Youtube reviews I checked out,positive
Pros1 records excellent audio through built in mics2 records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile3 I love the 4 track ability and the effects built in to the device I can record multiple things in less time especially when Im just messing around to get a feel for a song4 comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the boxCons1 battery life is weak2 built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want This thing is awesome,positive
Ive had this Amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great Took a while for me to learn all the things that the Jam can do since I was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when I received it Crank this baby up and it moves air Ive used all the ins and outs with no problems My rig consists of an Ibanez AS73 Schecter Devil Custom 2008 Line 6 HD500 and an AKG Perception 420 thru a Line 6 UX2 Finally I only play at home so this gear doesnt get banged up from giggingI agree here As B Russell said The only downside I can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged There are a lot of features on this amp but you need to learn how to use them The common features are easy to use but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp you will need to invest some time into it Since Im not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual this amp fits me well Great Sounding Amp with options,positive
Whats to say Its not a high end capo and for the price I can lose it like most of the other capos I have owned Its not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly A reasonably decent capo that you can afford to leave somewhere,neutral
Nice cables So far Ive not had any problems with them but havent put them through a lot of use just yet Also have the Monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more Ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other Good cables at a good price,positive
Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference as expected It makes sense that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs and I didnt notice either effected Great pop filter with long neck,positive
Every issue I had was ironed out by Mackie supportThey are seriously fabulousIm using this for a simple weigh station between my DAW and my Tascam 16 trackSo far no problems at all Great Mackie support,positive
I had always used the Kyser cliponthetop capos and still do but I liked the look on this Dunlop cliponthebottom model It works great and looks better Great capo,positive
this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank I have made them last up to 2 monthsstill obtaining decent sound OK strings for the price,positive
all my guitars use this quick release clip its so easy to install and sturdy material it wont break easily even after many uses have one now love it,positive
There are better tuners out there Far better This could be good but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there and they dont even tune it well to Standard especially when tuning the G string I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing but sometimes I want to fiddle around with opentunings on an acoustic This pieceofjunk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using F or C notes I have no clue as to why that is pretty stupid if you ask me especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic dbags I say that with love that play in open tunings Trust me your money is best spent elsewhere Yak,negative
This Capo is one of the best made Ive seen It fits the neck of my electric guitar perfectly and stays securely at any positionVery well constructed Easy to attachdetach Fit is wonderful,positive
Replaced the plastic saddle in my Yamaha F335BL Had to file it to make it thinner and filed it down to make it shorter than the old saddle this made the action a bit lower and made it easier to play for a beginner It did change the sound of the guitar it sounds fuller and the sustain is longer Makes cheaper guitars a tad better,positive
I dont know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case This one surpassed my expectationsMonths into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem The pockets are packed with books tools and stringsThe shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze Great bag for the buck,positive
Through my Ampeg bass amp the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7 and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain Low E string gets fuzzy fast Other strings bland sounding,negative
I got 3 of these to plug XLR cables into the 1434 jacks on my board I got it because my board only has 6 channels with XLR inputs None of them work Perhaps I got the wrong thing Not what I thought,negative
Im a DAddario man myself but hey free is free So I jumped at a chance to try these strings out Thus far they have proven durable both in terms of playability and longevity of tone So many other variables to consider when rating strings such as the guitar they go on the gauge of string being used the playing style and climate of the end user etc These are a solid performing string set though I am unlikely to switch allegiances from DAddario any time soon Still there is no reason to fear trying these Elixirs out Im a DAddario man myself but hey free is,positive
This is an awesome analog echo effect Very similar to a EHX Memory Man it does it all The only complaint is the pots have limited function unlike the MM so instead of a lot of play on some of the knobs you have a very little bit of play which can be annoying Other than that for the price its just awesome Wow,positive
One of the strap buttons on a guitar I was given as a gift was missing I was told that it would need some minor repairs so all I had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for itThis strap button was screwed right in the minute I got it and it worked like a charm I put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasnt given me any problems A Perfect Replacement for a Perfect Price,positive
Ive tried to like this pedal I really have Maybe its my signal chain My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar Sure the OD is there but it isnt worth losing your tone is it Again I reiterate maybe its just me I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now And the blue pedal isnt any different either IMO Grunge was OK but not my kind of style Mediocre IMO,neutral
I bought these to beef up the bottom end of a Telecaster that came from the factory with a set of Fender 9s that topped out at 042 on the low E which is just too small for good twangy bass Ive been using them for a few months now and havent broken one even though I can bend the high E to touch the D string I use DAddarios on my other guitars but tried these Ernie Balls just for the hybrid mix and there isnt a whole lot of difference DAddario sells a similar set called EXL125 so maybe Ill try those next but for now these are good Great mix to add bass to your sound,positive
Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs but IMHO the tremolo from Danos Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only 4 more at the time of this review The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link I dont think its true bypass either The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure true bypass sturdier inputs and knobs and a much better onoff switch The features and sound are the same Spend the extra 4 and you will have a much more bulletproof pedal with the Cool Cat trem Not bad but the Cool Cat line is 4 more and a better build,neutral
This Multiplug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals I only needed it for two pedals which are not in a case so there is some extra plugs hanging on the floor but is better than setting up another wall wart each pedal If needed in the future I have these extra plugs I recommend this MultiPlug to everyone Visual Sound One Spot MultiPlug 5 Cable,positive
All of the PDDW products Ive bought have been amazing from stands to thrones etc This stand is an amazing value and provides a lot of flexibility when mounting your cymbals Solid too DW doesnt mess around,positive
Musicfriends This is a fab item For 2000 You cant go wrong on this Warm distortion and good controls For me great studiorecording use but thats it I would certainly not tour with it its built cheap w plastic housing and one circuit board squeezed in and funny enough the one piece rugged metal is the bottom plate Hello designers Metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must But anyways bottom line great unit for 2000 and sounds good very versatile 2000 You cant go wrong on this,positive
Im happy with this purchase I bought it during the Black Friday sale It works for what I use it for When not in use it just gets put away Doesnt take a lot of space Love it,positive
The product feels a little on the cheap side but definitely does the job the way it should so thats all I care about It was cheap and came fast I recommend it Feels cheap but does the job,positive
I have been using these for months now with 5string bass I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar as I often find myself playing with fingers then suddenly a pick song starts and wheres a pick I usually have to offset it and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick but I still find them indispensable And no tape or other sticky stuffThere is also a model made specially for bass Updated I now have the bass model on all of my basses It is definitely better for thicker stringsThe guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer I do love it but the spreading strings on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect So still highly recommended if your headstock has a straight through design not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock They should make a Metal Edition for that Back to order more,positive
The cable died on me in less than a month Very disappointed in built quality Very disappointed in built quality,negative

I bought this to go with my Shure SM58S It fits the mic well No odor Effective at suppressing pops Does what its supposed to,positive
This is a great guitar for the money I paid 6934 for my guitar and bought it through Amazoncom from Streamline Audio Video It arrived ahead of schedule in great shape ready to play right out of the box after tuning it of course If you want a better guitar than this you will need to spend a whole lot more The sound is great and it is easy to play Only about 4134 long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs stated in the description My strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what I will need Believe the Reviews,positive
This is a good product The construction is pretty good It will give you a variety of bass tones You have to buy a 18 trs to a 14 ts adaptor to line out to your amp or sound system Good product,positive
I bought this recently for 40 to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades For 40 its an awesome deal But objectively when compared to an Epiphone 335style case I bought last year for 81 its deserving of 4 stars which isnt bad just not greatPROS Decent build quality four buckles one locking and three hinges very nice plush lining not heavy knobs on bottom so it stands on end knobs on side and back so its never directly on the floor fits a dreadnaught wellCONS Not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut the one locking buckle wouldnt stop anyone the big front and back body panels flex more than they should exterior covering feels somewhat cheap the handle is hard plastic and not paddedSo for 40 its a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard but it doesnt measure up to a basic Epi 335 case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes It also had a strong chemical odor but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away Excellent for the price but still a budget case,positive
This is one of my favorite music purchases in a while Cleans up your gears appearance tremendously Very easy to use and lots of extra cable length AWESOME,positive
I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forthI like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std Telecaster input jack greatThe flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked These do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage I have more expensive cables but rather use these Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable Right Angle Plug 20 feet,positive
this is not the greatest product they make but it works quickly and makes the 12 string spread when needed to do so more easily than most a little iffy,neutral
I installed this in two minutes I was planning on just using my twistnlock drywall anchors I bought at home depot to install some shelving recently but thats what it actually came with These anchors are great I used an 1164 drill bit for the pilot holes Dont use a bigger bit It might be tempting to use a 14 drill bit if youre thinking of the push in type drywall anchors That would be a mistake These are better and screw in I used a manual ratchet screwdriver The anchors go flush with the wall then you screw the wood screws into the center of the screw head and through I recently installed several shelves in two apartments a friend saw mine and wanted some too and these are the anchors I used Of course a stud is better and also if your drywall is already crumbling thats no good For a typical well maintained house or apartment though this should be fine even without a stud I have a Schecter five string bass hanging from it and Im confident thats not going to pull out from gravity A heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged One such as the screws packaged in actual twistnlock anchors Looks nice Decent price Simple and easy,positive
Ive only been using the yellow one so far only just started using them But I like how the grip is strong cause of the rubber and the grooves The colors and designs are pretty As far as I can tell they are all the same widththickness For some reason I thought theyd have different thicknesses from a previous review And so far I havent lost any yay Very pretty they hold nicely,positive
Ive tried a lot of thumb picks i use them for bass you no what that does to themthese are the ones im staying with these thumbs Good,positive
Well its a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar This is a fairly good size cloth at that Its a cloth,positive
Ive been buying gear from Alto Music since 1980 Ive trusted them with my guitars and theyve helped me make the right decisions for my needs and budget Last year I bought a set of Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials directly from Altos web site Over the past year I received a bunch of Amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a Shure SM7b When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music it was a no brainer I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon As for the mic its an SM7b and its everything I was looking for despite it being a low output mic Its smooth has a sexy low end color has no harshness brittleness or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers Im recording in an untreated basement and this mic is perfect for when Im singing loud rock stuff it only picks up whats right in front of it and none of the room Im using a Focusrite 2i2 which is great for loud singing but Im picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well For me the mic has been all its cracked up to be Great microphone from a fantastic music store,positive
I ordered this pedal based on the previous review but to me it sounds cheap and faint I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one I wont be keeping To me it wasnt even close to as good as what you get on Fender amps or on my TC Electronics Delay pedal which includes chorusvibrato and I thought that I would go solo with this pedal but for me its a no go Not as good as I thought it would be,neutral
I used to buy a lot of wire form these guys However you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an XLR cable testerI didnt believe it myselfI read another reviewer had an issue with XLR cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin So I took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cablesI got through only 4 monoprice cables before I found one that was misswired Now I will be checking all of them for sureNot a good start thoughGlad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it onI suggest everyone check their monorpice cables The testers are very cheap and may show problems you werent aware of be carefull with these,negative
I bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room It looks really good almost like an ornament It sturdy and good quality 5 stars Looks nice and sturdy A space saver,positive
My fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought So I guess she loves it as that is the only pick Ive now seen her use She has been playing for over 35yrs I need to use it,positive
This is the best octaver I have ever played through I bought my first one in 1980 and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive THREE umm densitytimbraltonal choices chorused only octaved signal 5050 mix cleanoctaved signal PER setting which ranges from 2 to 2 octaves Quiet and tiny footprint Youd be dumb not to get one while theyre cheap HELL YEAH,positive
This is a great effect Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlops MXR products has always presented The true bypass feature and the highend quality materials make it very reliable and dependable Phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should No need for the EVH red logo version unless youre a super fan or something I actually believe this unit will exceed all your expectations Ships fast Highly recommended MXR Phase 90 Effects Pedal Great effect,positive
usually picks are picks but these are a blast I play by holding the horns between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes I had to order 2 extra bags of these because people keep begging for one fun picks,positive
This product is something every guitar owner needs It is well built performs well and sells at a very reasonable price The sting cutter works well I must have for anyone with a guitar,positive
Great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it Very sheep relatives with the quantity Picks,positive
I have been using a ZT Lunchbox Amp for about a year Blindfolded you wont confuse it with a Marshall stack or a blackface Deluxe but for a small portable solid state amp it works as advertised People that say it is loud arent kidding but there are limits The sound from the 65 speaker requires some space to develop Up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass I use mine for practice at home and for lowvolume band rehearsals I played it once on stage micd through a PA but wasnt happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a 12 speakerTo me it sounds best with humbuckers but Ive played single coil guitars Fender and Gibson through it with usable results If you are after clean volume you might be disappointed It only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying Players that use a lot of distortion eg Metal will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume While the ZT Lunchbox isnt as versatile as some other small amps it is great for a one trip load in at rehearsalsOne thing to consider is adding the matching ZT extension cabinet It makes a big difference in two ways two 65 speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound Also because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased This is a big help at rehearsals I point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room Ive tried using a guitar speaker cab a PA speaker and a PA floor monitor as an extension speaker but the ZT extension cabinet sounds best to me Its the same size as the ZT Lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack themFor an ultraportable guitar or harmonica amplifier that can get decently loud the ZT Lunchbox is hard to beat But if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a 12 speaker works better Good For What It Does,positive
Once you get the hang of this capo its wonderful It takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tensionI have several guitars but the one that I love using this capo on has a hard 34V34 neck Its pretty accurate on that neck up to the 4th fretNice product Worth the investment Now I just have to figure out how to keep up with it Great capo,positive
Capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration serves me well,positive
I ordered three of these so farVery affordable and good quality Made in CanadaKeeps wireless unit very snug and tightEasy in and out with Velcro retaining strap all leatherI use the little plastic flat ring on the bottom to loop my strap through which keeps it tight against the guitar strapThe width of the slots are 1 inch and 11634 or approximately 27 mm wide The leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fitThese are much better than I suspected and have a few expensive Levys classic padded straps They fit each other like a glove and are very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdyIf you click on the item and go to the product page I have uploaded some photos of actual use and closeups Works well with Levys or common slotted leather straps,positive
This is an amazing amp It works great a lot of power a little bit heavy for its size but it is simply a beauty I play a godin a6 ultra and the The sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect Even the acoustic sound is majestic this amp adapts to any need you have from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound EXCELENT SUPER CLEAN SOUND,positive
This was a great addition to our studio here at The price was great and quality was awesome Highly recommend Great quality awesome price,positive
This pick will give you a distinct tone because its made of metal not plastic Im sure it wont wear out any time soon either The size is regular I just wish it had a sharper point but I can still pick fast enough with it to play speed metal Great grip and unique tone,positive
This is just the tuner I was looking for It works on vibration or mic so its very versatile It works on my acoustic bass electric and my mothers voice Havent tried the trumpet yet Intuitive and the backlit screen is so easy to see PERFECT,positive
This thing is amazing Like many I cannot afford a tube amp This transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps I played years ago Sustain and harmonics are insane Preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tonesThe unit is very heavy and rugged The only component I would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost The Beast,positive
The One Spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts Get it you wont be sorry Works great,positive
Standard 1046 nickel wound set great for most general purpose playing like rock blues country what ever Some more advanced players might prefer boutique strings like DR but these are good for most folks Like,positive
I would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only If you are going to be playing acoustic I would get their specific acoustic cable This is a very heavy guage Sounds great Heavy guage,positive
Purchased this Korg Guitar and Bass Tuner for our son who uses it to tune his acoustic and electric guitar He says its easy to use and is durable It has LED lights to follow as well as a meter to use Excellent producthighly recommend Great Functional Tuner,positive
This is just what the doctor ordered I bought three and am purchasing 3 more All of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders If I switch one mic to another stand it could not be easier just a press of a little button With different shock mounts on different mics I dont have to worry about rethreading the mounts each time I change mic stands The time it saves is also invaluable No problem with quality control on the 3 I now have and I have no complaint with the build Great for the studio where I use mine would think It would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand use a clip for thatAddendumI love these so much I have bought one for each mic in my locker and each stand Thats a total of 12 None of them have failed after almost a years worth of use the best invention for a mic since the shock mount These will save you time guaranteed Nice invention,positive
This is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast especially if you are using any of the XENYX or other Behringer brand mixers it also works with other mixers as wellThis is a great inexpensive way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software It works on Windows Mac and Linux at least it did for me is good cheaply made though,positive
 Great sound and features for the price,positive
I play in our band at church and as such Ive been wanting a Vox AC15 for quite some time For those of you who do not play contemporary Christian music and are wondering what the heck Im talking about lets just say that its an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music you must utilize a Vox tone Because of U2 I know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for itAnyway for the past few years Ive been utilizing a Line 6 Floor POD Plus to achieve this tone Ive been using the Class A sound which is close and quite useable but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and Ive never found a way around that I just sort of dealt with it Then came Fathers Day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used Vox AC15C1 and I love everything about it Doing a little research it seems that its predecessor AC15CC1 was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners Well the AC15C1 implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp thats awesome right out of the box Ive seen some people complain about the fact that its a PCB inside and not handwired and that its made in China So what It sounds very nice especially for the low priceThe amps overdrive is very rich with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume I cranked it to 10 in my living room and was quire loud for a 15W amp but not windowshattering loud In a church setting this is obviously not an option Fortunately you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy Vox tone just at a more manageable level You need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the Top Boost and Normal channels Ive opted to just use the Normal channel and push it with a Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal which by the way is the most impressive 40 overdrive pedal youll ever hear That overdrive does not interfere with the Vox tone at all I used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with DiMarzio HS series pickups and the Joyo pedal pushing the amp and it was classic Vox chime all the way I also used a Boss DD5 delay also required if you play in a Christian band same reason as the other thing I mentioned Pure tone heavenSome have noted noise or hiss problems with this amp which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes Mine did not have this problem Actually I thought it did and I was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before I realized that it was the way I had the amp set up As I stated earlier this is a 2channel amp Normal and Top Boost but which one youre using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into I was plugged into the Normal channel and didnt realize that the Top Boost volume was dimed and thats where the hiss was coming from I just shut that volume completely off since I was not using the Top Boost channel anyway Problem solvedIm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice Ive owned Marshalls MESABoogies a Laney a Music Man and other oddball tube amps over the years some costing several times the cost of the Vox AC15C1 and the Vox can hold its own with those others Think of it as an affordable boutique amp If you can pick one up used like I did all the better Interestingly enough this amp was advertized as a used Vox AC15 with no indication of whether it was a C1 or a CC1 Fortunately it was a C1 Its a value at full price also Get one Vox Really Nailed It With This One,positive
This is the second one i buy and i love it is small fast and accurate best of all you dont need to have the volume knob open for tuning i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive but it feel quality and does it job perfectly my friend love it above all the other gift it is a everyday use tool for a musician it is a everyday use tool for a musician,positive
This is a really nice product for the price When fully extended it becomes a little tippy but I dont fully extend the legs which gives it a wider more stable base Otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel Nice product Nice for home,positive
I dont often capo my guitar When I do I need something that goes on quickly and is firm on the neck You cant get better than this Easy strong capo,positive
Well made sturdy and adequate for use on a pedal board or just to connect various pedals via the traditional way Nice,positive
Sure there are fancier Tremolo pedals out there but Ive always been a fan of the Boss TR2 Its got a more mellow and vintage Fender Tremolo output and suits my playing to a T Pair this beauty up with an ElectroHarmonix Cathedral Reverb pedal and get lost for days Definitely worth the reasonable cost Easily One Of My Favorite Tremolo Pedals,positive
This is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a Mixer Rack or Piano scissor stand The square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading The MIC end of the mount works pretty good Overall the only problems I found is that the Up tube could be 1 to 1 12 taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer Mic Mount,neutral
Works great for changing guitar strings Good build and doesnt look cheap Builtin string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus Effective string winder,positive
I already have one of these stands for one of my guitars and recently bought the tubular typeI should have bought another one of these instead As someone else mentioned here this stand does not put any unnecessary pressure on the guitar and the space needed on the floor is minimal and the guitar can be displayed near a wall I highly recommend this guitar stand5 stars I should have bought this one,positive
If your a musician or want to be recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well I have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said you cannot beat a Tascam recorder for ease of operation features and sound quality Enough said buy a Tascam if you serious about your music Cant have too many quality recorders,positive
My favorite brand of strings right now 8 guitars now are fitted They bend easy last longer feel smoother and a shot of Finger Grease Spray just adds the icing to the cake Excellent Strings,positive
I have Schaller Security Strap Locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase Schallers for that one soon These give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place My Larrivee RS4 came with these and converted me to Schaller Best Security Strap Locks Ive tried,positive
I picked up another one of these for a new guitar and Im very impressed Theyve upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one I purchased a few years ago Excellent stand Excellent,positive
This little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such but dont expect it to last forever as is typical with Behringer products At least its cheap though I just wish it had a power switch Lacks a power switch,positive
I have found that everything Schaller makes is Grade A1 in My book Made in Germany NOT China these locks are fast and secure I like the way they slide on off which if Your like Me having to change Guitars during a show or just at home the change is smooth and safe No dropping guitars around here I have them on all My guitars Schaller strap locks,positive
great sounding strings you can hear the difference once it is used i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance great sounding strings,positive
This is a great guitar for the money It has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments The built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it Great Guitar,positive
Ive been playing long enough to remember when 34small34 electronic tuners were the size of a paperback book and had prices approaching 100 New tuners like the Snark SN8B are a joy in comparison The display is good sized and easy read without my reading glasses and the tuner responds quickly and accurately The only complaint Ive heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight Yeah So It wont fall off while youre using it or playing and you shouldnt leave anything clamped to your guitar when you arent using it anyway You cant beat the price for a tuner this easy to use and it comes with a cleaningcarrying bag too Ive used it with standard and altered tunings on guitar bass banjo mandolin ukulele and tipple This one worksOne suggestion for any younglings reading this take it from an old f electronic tuners are great especially for tuning back stage or in other places where it isnt quiet but please do yourself a favor and learn to tune by ear Ive met too many young players that cannot tune a guitar without an electronic tuner If the battery dies they are tone deaf Trust me the ability to tune by ear is a skill you will always use If a string goes sharp or flat while Im playing I can tune it back without stopping I would not be able to do that if I hadnt learned to tune by ear Small Bright and Quick,positive
I have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great escpecially for the money I would recommend this to anyone Very Simple Works Great,positive
Stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time These hangers are easy to install just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business The stringed instrument becomes easily accessible and safe great item,positive
I was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad I did I am now able to play record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers Does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound I recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar Great sounding and works perfect through any amplifier,positive
I think manymost guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try My favorite picks for the last 8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks theyre nylon picks that have a raspy cats tongue surface that makes it super easy to gripIve also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit but theyre not my favorite I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them Soundwise I dont find that theyre significantly different from any other pick If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my 1 Very good picks,positive
They all work and none of them have given any trouble My pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around a lot I would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great No regrets Rock On They work,positive
Pickguard screws The screws are not very tough and you have to be gentle with them so that the screwdriver doesnt bugger up the heads They are not high enough quality that they can be put in and taken out more than a couple of times before they become worn Will likely not get two or three uses out of them,positive
I havent had an issue with this cable yet and the guage of the wire connecting the plugs is very thick and high quality but it takes a while for them to stop coiling up Like the title says the timeless combo of Neutrik Mogami is better If youre wondering how to get NeutrikMogami cables cheap make them yourself It saves you so much money Beyond high quality but overpriced The timeless combination of Neutrik and Mogami is better,positive
I can now say I have used several others coated Martins flat wounds smooth wounds EXP Elixir etc These are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks Their tone is slightly bright but not as 34harpsichord34 as the EXP I am done experimenting These are the strings for Takamine guitars Yep these are my go to strings,positive
This is a great product that does what it says Its a tad pricey but all in all well worth it My only complaint is that its not labeled in a way that you can identify what outlet is what when its mounted in a pedal train other than that its a great device love this thing,positive
I havent had to change the battery on this bad boy in over two years since Ive had it It also is bright and is very accurate If looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further Great life,positive
Heavy construction in layered leatherThere is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive lookingI will buy another in a second color Heavy duty classy guitar strap,positive
I could not be happier Excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised The effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful Buy it Best mixer for the money,positive
These bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break One of my favorite strings for my Les Paul I tend to go with Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on my Strat but these would probably sound nice on a Strat as well Clasic sound great quality,positive
I got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars Great little stands at a great price They are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable Id suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand Nice,positive
I have two of them One in the guitar case holding my Martin HD28 and the other in the case of my Blueridge flattop Just clip it on about the nut and tune away Pickers playing next to me dont interfere with me tuningWorks great Love it,positive
It works ok if you are used to using a volume pedal I had a hard time making small volume changes while singing I decided to return it It is well made so if you like volume pedals its probably one of the best I have also owned the Moreley Lil Alligator volume pedal It has a mimimum volume knob which allows more subtle changes between rhythm and lead volumes The Dunlop does not have that feature Review of Jim Dunlop Volume pedal,neutral
If you want U2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound Thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob For the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget Great for the price,positive
Bought these to replace the ones that I had previously ordered from another vendor These have good shielding not like the others Happy,positive
This string compares significantly to the ProArte string The sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less Its so similar I contacted DAddario to ask them what the difference was They stated the ProArte strings are made of a better nylon and to more stringent specs but in all honesty I wonder if the strings arent identical but these marketed primarily to students and schools as a more economical stringWhatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture Theyre DAddario and DAddario never produces junk Their cheapest string is as good or better than more expensive strings in other brands Ive never used a set of DAddario in any classification of guitar that I didnt likeFor those who are curious Id recommend doing what I did buy a set of these and a set of the ProArte theyre both pretty inexpensive and compare and see which you like best or if you like both equally I think it would be good to get several reviews here of such a test between the two grades Whichever set one ultimately chooses cant go wrong with the qualityprice ratio The ProArte String a little cheaper,positive
This is an excellent gig bag Plenty of compartments for all of your accessories Well padded and has enough carrying options A good buy Excellent Gig Bag,positive
Its noisy but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume it works fine I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product Its ok when you get to equalize the tone,neutral
Seriously this is a great pedal I cant improve upon what others have said but I will mention a few points1 I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop Its run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me2 I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies3 If it gets noisy or self oscillates after a while change the battery to a fresh one Better yet use an AC adapterI found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews Otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years I take care of my stuff Tastier than Fish N Chips,positive
A friend gave me a few of these and overall I like them Id give them 35 stars if I could Having said that I dont like them as much as a regular nylon pick The star hole just feels a bit weird to me though I could probably get used to it Im glad I got to try these but these wont replace my favorite nylon picks Pretty good,neutral
Accurate little accessory only works with guitars It seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with Only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar I dont know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments or for uses other than tuning Amazing Tuner,positive
These are my favorite guitars strings they last a long time bend well hold great sound and you wont have to tune your guitar every five minutes like some strings Best guitar strings ever,positive
I picked up a couple of these straps one for a Les Paul and one for a bass Anyone whos ever played a Les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a musthave This one fits the bill The endpieces are thick with a peghole that just fitsnot so small you have to cut and not so large youre worried about the guitar slipping out The cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable It doesnt scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesnt grab your shirt so badly Cant complain Good strap at a good price Nice and comfy,positive
This is an absolutely amazing Reverb pedal TC toneprint is very much a novelty a very useful one at that if you want to dial in some really nice presets Where this pedal really shines is in its endless ability to tweak the parameters using the downloadable editor You can spend hours finding 34Your Sound34 or just 34The Sound34 that you need High quality chassis excellent switch and inputoutput jacks that give a satisfying thunk indicating your cable is secured Dont forget to lift the back panel to adjust the dipswitches to change the true bypass tone dry through etc All and all a great one stop reverb pedal with tons of tone and potential that should last a lifetime Halla,positive
I couldnt be happier with this pedal I have a Les PaulMarshall Class 5BB preampEP BoosterAnalog Chorus and Carbon Copy I used to get this annoying hum and feedback when I cranked the amp up even when I just plugged the guitar straight to the amp but those days are long gone now everything is nice and quiet I even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job I havent noticed any difference in tone so far I was scared that the Smart Gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and its cheaper not to mention it has its own effects loop I dont understand how the Noise Supressor or the Decimator could be better than this one I mean the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no solved all my problems,positive
The title pretty much says it all This is such a simple great tuner The streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical Great deal Why did I wait this long to buy,positive
While the Tascam US322 Audio Interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included Cubase LE software I am not a novice at home recording as I have used many devices from 4 track cassettes to ProTools setups over the years Here is a rundown of my disappointing experience1 plugged into my iPad using the camera kit USB connector got device not compatible with iPad message Too bad but I can still use my ART USB interface which works quite well with Garageband2 installed driver on my old G4 Mac running 1058 opened Garageband got no input messageCould not evaluate the Cubase software as it requires Mac OS 1068 If I get a new computer I will update my review Until then Im disappointed WARNING Does not work with iPad Garageband older Macs,neutral
We picked up the XCG4 Guitar Stand for my daughters acoustic guitar and it is exactly what was needed Here are my observationsPros Stable once setup and tightened down this is very sturdy Adjustable the height and base can be configured to accommodate the guitar Security Strap has a rubber strap that hold the neck securlyCons Slight chemical smell that dissipates after a few daysThis is a good value for a very functional and good looking guitar standHighly RecommendedCFH Great Value Guitar Stand Highly Recommended,positive
Fits perfectly in sound holeNo more feedback or waking up the next roomNo plastic smell eitherPlay an Ibanez acoustic electric Perfect fit,positive
Needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer It is limited in what it can do but it does the job Im rapidly becoming a behringer fan The three points mentioned in another rating Inputs should be out the back needs rubber feet and the led are spot on Id also like to see another set of outputs on it as well It could also use being a tad bigger they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together The LED for the power on this thing is so bright its obnoxious it almost blinds you Other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise Behringer comes through again,positive
I plugged in the amp and I plugged in the bass and there were no issues with the wire This is one of those products you dont want to overly notice and in that it has done the job is is designed for Working cord,positive
Nice picks much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks I prefer the jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s are warmer sounding and wear resistant but these pitch blacks are not bad They do wear down quickly but a dozen should last a good amount of time This pick does what jazz picks are suppose to do and in my universitys jazz ensemble the three tips are useful and makes playing difficult jazz chord easy It will feel awkward at first if you never used jazz picks but once you get the hang of it youll never go back to standard picks good picks,positive
When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording Once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it thereOn the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use Will Give You Better Recordings But Can Be A Pain,positive
I am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product I have been playing professionaly for more than 35 years and in that time have gone through many amps guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts The great ones I have kept over the years Ibanez TS9 and TS 10 MXR Compressor etc and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesnt take up much stage room The one item that I didnt have in a pedal form was a good reverb I have had great success with other Behringer rack products Digital Reverbecho EQs patch panels and other home studio stuff The DR600 was my first Behringer pedal I think it works great I have had it for about 6 months and have used it almost every weekend since I got it to play jobs with my band often several nights a week It has given me no problem I cant speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a One Spot multi AC adapter Does just what I wanted it to do,positive
Ive tried them all and I like the Shubb the best Easy to use very tight and doesnt get in the way The Best,positive
Im not a pro by any means I am enjoying this guitar It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit More than my other guitars again not a pro One of the screws by the jack was loose nearly stripped when I got it A drop of wood glue fixed it Had I paid 300 or more for the guitar Id have been upset but as is that was an easy fixMy biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less 34natural34 that the image appears to be Its pretty enough and fine for a 100 guitar But I really wanted 34natural wood34 and it isnt Otherwise it would be a 5 star I play it every day Great for the,positive
I didnt have any issue with this when I went to put it in my strat build Not a lot to say about it really Its metal and it works Switchcraft is usually a good product Good unit,positive
Solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music Very portable though the holder can be a challenge at times I have another stand that collapses into a very compact unit but if you have heavy tomes that you wish to use or several sheets that you want to string this unit is superior Great stand,positive
I cant really say anything negative about this set of nylon stringsIt sounds really good on my classical guitar Will buy it again in the future exactly as expected,positive
Using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal Works great no noise Well made cable with bulletproof molded TS protection The cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well Without a doubt a very sturdy cable Works no noise,positive
Taylor ships this guitar with these strings and for a good reason They sound wonderful right out of the box Like with mostall 12string guitars lights or extra lights are most often appropriate the feel of these Nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate in tandum with the instrument bring out its best resonance and sustainabilityGive em a try They sound lovely on my Taylor 355 12string,positive
I like this tuner as much as my SN8 Its accurate fast reading and has the added feature of acoustic mode if you need it This is a good one,positive
This music package by Led Zepplin is historical and put together well Great for any Zep fan Great audio and video I especially liked the unreleased version of For Your Life Great product,positive
I love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a Yamaha I currently have 3 acoustical Yamaha Guitars The FG 700S is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar I usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and I can reach the full length of the neck with no problems It has a deep tone and good volume I give 5 stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player Yamaha FG700sGood Action and deep tone,positive
This power supply is unbelieveble versatile when i first saw this i believed it was only for 6 pedals but it turns out it can power up A LOT pedals better than any power supply out there this power up my 12 pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more im buying 3 more and it will work only with this Thats why i say this is the best on the world theres nothing better,positive
Im now have my music together great for small space 34does it works34 limit to one mic but enogh for me Good for the price,positive
This was a terrific dealMy son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic so I decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great cant go wrong,positive
These heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound Attack is superb especially when played hard and loud and the construction ensures minimal ring and overtoneBe aware that this head pack does not product the best tone and sound for jazz get Remo Fiberskyns for that kind of sound but the Pinstripe model that comprises this pack has become the De Facto standard for rockIf you still have the heads that come with your drum kit and play rock changing over to this pack will probably make a dramatic improvement in the way your kit sounds regardless of whether you are playing a budget noname brand or Pearl Mapex Tama Ludwig or similar pro quality drumsI also recommend that you get a Rhythm Tech Memo Key ASIN B0002E2EOE or Evans Torque tuning key ASIN B0002D0HZI to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have them installed Either of these will allow you to get the most out of these or any other heads and transform your kit into a finely tuned professional sounding set of instruments Perfect for rock,positive
dont let the system absorbs you this device as others is really great for the money check everything by yourself this is as good as other devices that cost 34 times more berheringer EQ700 7 bands,positive
This works well with the mandolin It is certainly an easy change I would recommend it or purchase again It is certainly an easy change I would recommend it or purchase again,positive
I have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it This allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems The blue LED lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions Not a bad price either Just what I needed,positive
works great appears to be well made good connectors twenty five foot allows a great deal of movement good value xlr patch cord,positive
Its a short boom but it works great I really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening Locks great,positive
Ive tried a few different straplock options and these are the best Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good Highly recommend By far the best strap lock option,positive
I purchased this as my first classical guitar because I need a guitar I can plug in overall Im extremely impressed with it it stays in tune pretty well has shockingly low action for a classical sounds great plugged in and unplugged has a built in tuner comfortable to play overall I love the guitar well worth the money An awesome guitar,positive
This is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of peopleIt produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you dont want to be too loud It has a headphone jack also I like this so much I might experiment with miking it for gigs never thought I would say that about a 10 wattFender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one There is an overdrive onoff button with adjustable gain volume control and a simple treblebass equalizer Other then that it is all rock Physically it is built strong too Great Practice Amp,positive
This is a very useful little device I use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar It removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately This will increase the life of your strings Dont expect miracles but this helps quite a bit I have bought this for me and several guitarplaying friends that have found this much useful Highly recommended Cheers Very useful little device,positive
Ive used this pedal with a Casio PX200 keyboard for about 6 weeks nowProsSturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboardsPolarity switch I was using a Yamaha FC4 with an older keyboard but the FC4 does not work properly with the Casio keyboards Its a tipnegative polarity and the Privia requires a tippositive polarity So the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed Thankfully the SP2 has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboardCord is long enough 6ConBuild quality is slightly less than the FC4 The FC4 has a smooth action made in Japan but the SP2 had some problems with the metal spring squeaking Some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeakingThe SP2 also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal Overall it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals Good pedal for price,positive
Had for over a year hasnt failed Bedroom Vox amp never leaves the house never turned up above conversational volume level so I cant elaborate on sound can only comment on reliability for my usage Works,positive
When you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply There is no need to purchase a separate Behringer PSUSBOtherwise the time machine works fine as described Works as advertised,positive
Im very happy when I got this gig bag Good quality and Thik cussion Good enough to travel around this world with peace of mindBest price with free shipping Thats good enough Finish your serch and buy this one I highly recomended this PSthis gig bag cannot fit full size guitar OK Best quality in this price,positive
When I first felt this strap I smiledThis is so supple to the touch making playing with it a great experience Yet its durable enough even for the roughest of players It is fully adjustable allowing for all body types This is the first strap that Ive bought in a long time I have a Planet Waves strap with studs and I like it very much Its the only strap Ive ever used Untill now Now I have it put away and Im using this one If yore looking for a new strap I highly recommend this one Trust meYou will not be disapointed by it Yeah it looks a little plain but it doesnt slide around while playing and I love it BUY IT ALREADY XD The most comfortable strap ever,positive
love it fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate a must have for any musician snark tuner,positive
Depending on the amp and guitar you have this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer It sounds terrific with my fender strat single coil Danelectro lipstick pickups on my solid state amps giving them a warm tube like overdriveIt sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp it really sounds aweful with my 1980s Kramer loaded with humbucker pickupsYoull either love it or hate it That will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use its a different pedal with every combination On some amps it smokes and other amps it fizzles,positive
I just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good It coils nicely and has good connectors Nice XLR cable,positive
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs the first day it was fine if a bit sensitive by the third day it was broken cheap to buy but cheaply made ok at best,negative
I have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is Great As a matter of fact I ordered 2 more Get this one and have No Regrets Very Good Stand,positive
While it is just a stand it seems to be sturdy and durable Nothing special about it but also no negatives that I can find either than the fact that it doesnt give my foot massages XD Good,positive
Loved this Mic when I hooked it up it sounds great and for the price you cant go wrong Wish that it had a onoff switch but you can get around that Great for instruments and vocals as well Was delivered on time as well amazon is the best and have the best vendor Great mic,positive
great little time saver with all that is needed to restring in one compact deviceIt works well pretty good buy Good,positive
First of all dont expect any new tuner to work as a dropin replacement Dropin replacements for tuners basically dont exist unless you have the exact type of tuner and in that case you arent doing an upgrade Youll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer Or if theres a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby have a tech do the work for youThese tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele Unfortunately my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock which meant that the low E strings tuner was too large the wing for the screw hung over the edge Therefore I will not be installing these on my guitar but that is not the fault of the tunerFunctionally these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate and Ive heard the hold tune just fine Check the back of your headstock for fit but if thats a go these are a great option Great lookingperforming tuners but beware of size issues,positive
For performing Id go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price Would definitely purchase it again Great simple looper for rehearsing,positive
My experience with this little tuner has been perfectIts extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment its dead quiet when activated easy to understand when you are looking down at it while youre tuning Takes up very little room on a pedal board the cream on the coffee is that its under a hundred bucks thats crazy for the build quality its a little iron BRICKI highly recommend this little guy Korg got it right on this one Perfect,positive
Like many others wanted the brand name pedal drooled over it for years just cant pull the trigger on a 130 pedal Bought this instead and it plain rocks I put my pedals through three tests 1 playing alone 2 Playing at rehearsal and 3 gigs This thing stands up nicely on all three Using it with Am Sp Tele Hiway 1 Strat Squier 51 Epi LP Spec wp90 and Fender BJ Peavey Classic 3050 Sounds amazing in any combo Using it as my gain along with the Joyo Vintage OD for lead boosts Killer set up Lives up to the hype,positive
Bought this on a whim It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion When used with a pedalboard rig it doesnt add much except for hiss unfortunately Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit though Does not sound good with updated equipment Line 6 equipment Roland units Id say definitely do not get this if youre a tech or gear head Get it if youre a simple player with few FX in your arsenal It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar amp wah and guitar or amp wah guitar and expression pedal Nothing else Ive tied it to has seemed to work out though Probably a wasted product with where Im headed as a technical player but good for beginners and intermediate levels Into King CrimsonFripp styles Dont go for this for modeling Works well with some equipment Other equipment not as much,neutral
Ive used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot We got this one for my wifes mandolin Its small barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back I understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks its snug on my 12 fret slothead guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me The accuracy is as good or better than any Ive usedProsAccurateCheapEasy to see in daylight or darkGood battery lifeIts always there you dont have to hunt for a tunerConsI wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me Good tuner inconspicuous and it works,positive
Got this for my electric guitar Does its job just fine and the white tips look quite nice a truly great product Good size and works fine,positive
I bought two sets of these for two of my Fender 4x10 bass cabinets I slipped them right in using the original Fender screws since theyre machine screws EB comes with wood screws Very solid Excellent,positive
This is my second SM48 in 25 years Whats the difference between the 58 and the 48 The 48 is made in Mexico There is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the onoff switch I did not buy that one If feedback is an issue in your practice space get the one with the switch otherwise opt out for better clarityI say go for it Save 50 Very good mic for band practice,positive
not so pleased with the sound qualitysorta disappointed with it over allbut ya get what ya pay for so ill keep it anyway its ok,negative
With drum pads I basically either get 0 velocity or max And I have to really hammer on them to trigger Hurts after a whileLikes Size Assignable knobs Works good w Ableton LiveDislikes Drum padsKeys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and sizeIm looking to upgrade after a month Want better drum pads meh drum pads are horrible,negative
Sound is not so good Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything I got what I paid for,negative
Easy to use does a great job and comes off when you want it to and does not scratch or harm guitar in any way Great price as well I got two of them Awesome,positive
I like mic stands with folding legs like this as opposed to weighted bases since theyre easier to travel with Qualitywise this stand feels solid but not amazing 8211 its a mixture of plastic and metal construction For the price I paid around 25 its a nice piece of kit and everything holds as it should It also folds down pretty well Note that it does not include any kind of microphone clip or mount so youll need to provide your own The cable clips are a nice touch Nice mic stand low price,positive
cable works perfect no defects cystal clear sound constructed well use them in the studio no noticiable problems do not know how road worthy they are because I am a studio rat and not performer it works,positive
I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years Quickly though I will start by also agreeing that for the price it is hard to beat This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one It is accurate reliable for tuning and affordable All that said here is why I decided to write a review I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 34 months use The unit itself is great Here is the problem Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to its own clip is where this little gem falls short Sure if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky However if you travel with it take it on or off a few guitars a day or frequently adjust it it will likely eventually break Either the rubber feet that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuners head to the clip part will break Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars One for the electric one for the acoustic etc This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently Great price works well always breaks within a few months,positive
I purchased these picks because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise They dont make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible I need to have alot of pick speed These slow me down way to much The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks but no they are not Too bad as i had high hopesGood picks if you dont have to tremolo pick not very good if do have to not what I expected,negative
What can I say Its a mic cable haha Its a great cable for the price It sounds good and seems to be very durable Its not a monster cable but considering its 15 of the price I cant complain Great cable for the price,positive
nice sturdy construction for the most part although I dont like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends But for the price you get what you pay for I would have much better liked it if they were metal I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back Ill give it a try for a while but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare goot strap very comfortable but very long,positive
They have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better and they give u some spares Excellant,positive
These are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality I use these shorter cables if I have to run bits of my rack to external ampsunits ie unplugging and plugging in a lot and I find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable Im satisfied High quality cable,positive
Well i got this after hearing seasick steve its cool i havent figured it out just yet but its a very good product its a metal tube a shiney one,positive
Great case very well made and has great padding construction seems to be good and I have no complaints about this product Guardian Case,positive
I was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly but it seems to have no affect at all Super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain but just take it off when recording Very handy to have two picks with you at all times Its great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitars finish Me likey Price cant be beat either Very cool,positive
its sound pretty good i mean the range rate arent as broad as others ive tried but i stomp on it regularly it cuts my signal a bit so i compensate an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it upall in allworth it cant loose for the,neutral
I did some research on capos and decided to give Planet Waves a try I previously had one of those bungie cord like capos which was fine but it is a bit cumbersomeThe other capos I looked into were Kyser and Schubb Kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip Its disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune The Schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck The problem with the Schubb however is that it cant really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitarIn comes the Planet Waves It has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard However because of the adjustable tension you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness It might rule out the onehanded ease but it does take care of Schubbs problem of falling off In reality I only found that I need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if I move up way up the fretboard Between the 1st and 5th fret I dont really need adjust However if for some reason I want to capo at the 7th I do need to adjust the tension because its too tight In all its not that big a deal and its nice to have the option to adjust the capoIn all Im happy No capo is perfect You can do partial capos with this one Another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tensionIn case you arent aware this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars I have an electric guitar a nylon and a Recording King ROS06 with a chunky neck Works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ROS06 with that chunky neck Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard it does not work on classical guitars or anything with a flat fretboard The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved it will not apply pressure on the middle stringsIts a nice capo but it may not be what youre looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos A nice compromise between a Kyser and a Schubb,positive
Easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip Recommended Well worth the price of the product Great product,positive
The threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin but its still a great strap and holds up solidly Would certainly buy again Good strap,positive
I returned this because I wanted the script version instead Very different sound Watch YouTube to compare models This pedal seems older as well Mxr quality but modern sound,neutral
I bought a bass from this site and as much as I love the thing Im not an expert I popped my E string overtightening it when I was setting it up I replaced the factory strings with these Im told it sounds better now I think so as well but I cant quite quantify it Better than factory at the right price,positive
I bought this because I bought a used Martin D15M that didnt have a tuner built in and it clips right on the neck and is easy to turn on The cool led readout instantly tells you which string and gives you the green when the string is in tune This is a great little tuner and I recommend it Great little tuner,positive
Great Strap Button very solid aluminum and is easy to get that leather strap hole slips in very easy very pro Great Strap Button Solid,positive
we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner I used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly super tuner,positive
I had an issue with my new Squire Guitar and Fender hooked me up with a set of these The String Ends have a Cylindrical or Bullet Shaped end rather then the typical small loop The theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity I say they sound great and are worth trying I just order 3packs so I can have some on hand Cylindrical or Bullet Shaped String Ends,positive
These picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick I use them for playing bass They work well for that I have not used them for a regular guitar I prefer a standard pick for that Good picks,positive
I put these strings on my Guild acoustic electric I play mainly rhythm guitar to accompany my singing and do a bit of fingerpickingThe warmth of phosphor bronze strings suits my style and these strings have a great tone with crisp high notes and full rich bass endsThey are made by Taylor and all Taylor guitars come with Elixir strings Saving up for a Taylor in the meantime at least I can afford the stringsThese are very good longlasting strings To me Daddario are just as good Things like strings and picks are subjective Try different brands to find what suits you best If you are a serious player with a good guitar you should definitely check these strings out Your Guitar Wants These Strings,positive
No Doubt Its not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should First impression of the guitar was terrible I took it out of the box and started to play The neck had a huge bow in it The truss rod was completely loose I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable Im not sure if it was just my guitar that wasnt set up or if thats the way they come If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised The guitar sounded pretty good The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric Action was good Upper fret access is really good The guitar stays in tune while playing Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch I expected red paint I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting They are a little small 175 for a roundback is really a no brainer If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers Best Guitar You Can Buy For The Money,positive
Got them today and put them on a Wasburn X series Nice sound I would recommend these to anyone An inexpensive but nice set Nice strings,positive
if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you I was hesitant at first but this did the job worked well,positive
I have a couple of old guitars I couldnt bear to part with but seldom used Ah memories I keep my everyday guitars on stands so that it is easier to practice but these add charm to my music roomoffice and they work great The 34fingers34 will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly Great decoration for my music room I needed a place to display my old guitars,positive
These stands are just what I wanted for my studio I like them so much that I own five I like the easy access to my guitars for recording sessions and I like being able to look at them too The multiple guitar stands are probably safer for the stage and more economical with space but these stands are perfect for me as I dont gig much anymore Im very happy with the solid build Good solid guitar stand Great affordable stands for my home studio,positive
First Behringer pedal I have returned Almost no effect provided by pedal I have returned the unit Not worth it Lousy pedal Dont bother,negative
Ive only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic I wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions jams rehearsals and gigs but I also wanted the option of just capturing a line source such as from the DI on my bass amp Bingo Toss in the Dual Mode overdub phantom power ability to run off USB power and it is a total winner in my book When you select the recording format and encoding or resolution WAV bit and resolution MP3 bit rate etc each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card I also love that it uses full size SD cards microSD can be used with an adapter of course theyre much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinkynail sized micros Ill update this review after Ive had some more time with it Just what I was looking for,positive
Yes you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of Mogami gold quality I found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound Compared to my old cable the Mogami Gold produced a more transparent sound you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea When recording guitar I am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords No matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound I love Gold,positive
I have not used mine yet but my brother in law says it looks like i got the same strings on my guitar already i trust him he knows more about guiatars than i do good strings,positive
I can not evaluate the product until the instrument I purchased is repaired or returned Sorry I had rather not comment until it is used No comment at this time,positive
This miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing Just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting During winter when a guitar or mandolin 34moves34 with changes in humidity staying in tune is an issue even for expensive instruments This little device helps the player deal with the problem without constant recourse to a larger tuner Tiny convenient accurate enough,positive
These cables are sturdy and sound clean Using cheaply made cables could affect your sound you can loose top end I use Monster on all my mics XLR and all my instrument cables 14 with no issues Great product Highly recommended Great Product,positive
I bought this specifically for a GT100 It fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it There is enough room in the front pocket for the power supply input and output cables and maybe a little more I was also able to put a 3434 binder in on top of the GT100 which sort of protects the screens and knobs a bit more and provides a place for the stupid lead sheet binder than never fits in my other casesThis bag is a good size as just an accessory bag to carry along with a guitar and a combo amp if you have a couple pedals and cables or some odds and ends you want to bring alongProsLooks like the same basic quality as my other gator bagsGT100 Fits like a snug glove with just a little use it will be perfectFront pocket Reasonable priceCons They cost reduced their logo from a thread stiched logo to a cheap vinyl like silk screen or iron on patch unlike product photo and it doesnt match all my other gator bags Not a big deal but worth mention Other similar gator bags I own have a wrap around padded handle that velcros the two handles together once the bag is closed This does notOverall good product but would have liked that other padded wrap around handle and the 34non cost reduced34 logo Fits Boss GT100 or a good size as an accessory bag for stuff,positive
awesome cord hope they make more and the world will be a better place peace and love to you all yep,positive
This seems like a nice product but maybe Im doing something wrong I cant get the bottom guitar support to lock in place It twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place Maybe there is something I need to do differently Nice stand but,neutral
I needed a new stand for my home studio so I thought I was cutting corners when I purchased this one As it turns out this stand is practically indistinguishable from myBelmonte Orchestra Stand Deluxein construction and material quality That stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this reviewThe stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians and is stable enough to use outside The resttray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments In fact I have attached anAleratec Universal Tablet Mountto hold an iPad with sufficient room left over for a 438 page copy of theThe New Real Book Volume 1and it holds those rock steadyAnother feature that I like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands Or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stands footprint are not problemsBottom line this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price I am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever I need another stand this is the model I will purchase Inexpensive but not cheap,positive
The joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck Its just as good as any I love the joyo pedals affordable and doesnt break the bank love joyo,positive
I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar Installed as usual and tuned them They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible My capo could not even hold them I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now Use at your own risk I personally wouldnt give a nickel for them destroyed my guitar,negative
This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China I bought it to replace the original chipboard case for a 1963 Gibson ES135 archtop Lower bout is 1634 wide upper bout is 1234 wide body is 21 34 long and its about 534 deep at the bridge Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for The case is about 434 longer than the top of the headstock but I didnt expect an exact fit The wood shell is thin so dont drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases Normal plush fake fur inside with about 34 of soft foam all around Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use Only annoying thing the case arrived locked The keys were of course inside the case Dumb A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out Cheap But Useable,neutral
Im raising my rating and the result Getting demoted from the front page In any case even though I recently picked up the Sony PCMD50 from Amazon Im sufficiently impressed by the Zoom H2 to give it 5 stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of 816 track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders For quite a while its only competition was the EdirolR09 but as the price has come down the Zoom H2 stands out from its immediate competition Currently the H2 is my backup unit But for convenience or stealth purposes I often use it as my main recorderAnyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed Production values havent been spared in terms of the packaging the included equipment no batteries but a power adapter protective pouch handy table stand mic stand adapter wind screen ear buds USB cable and a 256mb SD card and the manual a quick setup sheet plus an ample booklet with generoussized print written in clear idiomatic English that makes some of Sonys recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparisonThe screen and controls admittedly are minuscule requiring sharp eyes though the screen is wellilluminated and nimble fingers I much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my Sony to the touchpad of the Zoom Whats encouraging about this recorder apart from the price is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile andor allaround musician in mind Its not simply another guitar players gadget loaded down with an endless supply of effects loops rhythm and bass tracks files within files programs buried within programs The H2 unlike my pricey Sony can handle both wav and mp3 protocol has microphone fields ranging from 90 degrees to 360 degrees is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures conversations solo performers and orchestras In short the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or moreand in a practical digital storage card formatOther Pluses Although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by Sony costing 60 and 90 respectively the Zoom onboard mic actually 4 is darn good It captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clocks chimes from upstairs And its reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past a single tiny hole is more common these days Getting the recorded signal onto a computers harddrive is expedited with the included USB2 cable and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like Cool Edit which I strongly recommend over editing in the recorder Theres also a metronome on board potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions and a tuner useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recordingPossible drawbacks 1 Zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistleslimiters compressors cutoff levels AGC control autodynamic levels sensitivity ratios panning effects and the list goes on Its too easy to miss a step to waste precious time fumbling with the menu to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments Moreover the instructions while clear and abundant omit much information that would help the beginner The hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone whos a complete newbie to someone whos a knowledgeable aficionado And I have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screens menu to get to a metronome or tuner Frankly with 75 kids squirming in their seats Id go to the old singlefunction dialup blockshaped metronome without a second thought2 The H2 is so light that using it with the AC adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely Undoubtedly youll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries it takes only 2 to record in the field At standard MP3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder3 My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site After having some difficulty with the install I decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in real timeWhats encouraging about this recorder apart from the price 23 of the H4 12 of the Edirol R9 is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile andor allaround musician in mindPerhaps the primary dealmaker or breaker The tiny screen and small controls Until mastering the miniaturization I would want to have a backup cassette recorder for any performance that I judged of special importance As for build quality my H2 is like new after almost 18 months use Undoubtedly youll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries it takes 2 to record in the field At standard MP3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorderMy H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site After having some difficulty with the install I decided to forget about itespecially after seeing how slow I mean really overnight slow the machine is in Normalizing a long file or converting it from wav to mp3 What takes minutes with a software program like Sound Studio or WireTap Studio requires hours when youre using the Zoom as a computer interface Use it for what it does bestnamely produce realistic audio from a tiny weightless durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame its expensive rivals A Must for Musicians Rivals the H4n and performs with machines costing 3 times as much Raising rating after 16 months use,positive
I got this to use with my 12 string It is a huge improvement over my other strap but it is not as padded as some that youll pay a higher price for It does the job however For this price you will be satisfied Good not Great,neutral
Works really well This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something You can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready Cool Product,positive
I popped the included battery into place fired it up clipped it to the head of my electric guitar and it worked seamlessly For the price this is a great deal Compact and Easytouse,positive
I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out The gel in the name sounded intriguing These are OK the colors are bright but otherwise theyre just standard plastic picks which on an electric I prefer nylon because its less clicky on the strings These are fine and if I pull one out of my gig bag Ill use it but overall there are other styles of pick that Id buy before buying these again Nothing wrong with them but theyre just normal plastic picks nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors OK but nothing special,neutral
The Yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful Its like a mini classical guitar except the recommended tuning is ADGCEA AD followed by the standard GCEA tuning on a 4string Ukulele but it can also be turned to EADGBE standard tuning on a guitarOn the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy A reviewer suggested using an extra hard high tension string like theDAddario Extra Hard Tension Classical Guitar Stringsto get around the floppiness on the EADGBE turning You can use a capo with this instrument MyKyser Capoworks on it just fineThe guitalele measures 2712 x 9 x 234 at their widest points The construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area where the neck meets the soundboard which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain not a big deal really The guitalele has a satin nonglossy finish which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a highgloss finish might incurThe package includes a black nylon gig bagFor a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a fullsize guitar the Yamaha Guitalele GL1 is a good buy just under a Ninety as of this writing High Quality GuitarUkulele Beautiful Sound,positive
I ordered them because they are carbon fiber but love them because I DONT loose picks anymore I used to lose a pick every other day Bought six still have six a week later Heres how I keep it about midway over the fretboard slide it between the E B and G strings the three smallest strings and slide it up towards the headstock It has little geckolike protrusions that grip the E string Stays in place and CANNOT slip out Wonderful The Bomb of picks IMHO,positive
I always played with the brown colored 351s growing up but I love the blue finish on these Id recommend the 351 Fender picks over any others personally but Im very partial to blue as well so these are perfect Probably my new favorite,positive
I use this to record my band and other songs into garage band Plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately I am missing out on a lot of this things capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what I need it for its perfect I use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks I researched a ton before I bought this one Touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys I could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my bands needs just fine perfect,positive
These are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer When they start sounding a little dull it wipe them down with Fast Fret loosen off the tension a bit and wipe em down firmly and they sound new again Ive tried them all these are the best,positive
This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups Its very easy to use and rugged If you play metal you might want to get the HardWire TL2 instead that pedal delivers more distortion an insane amount if necessary and more tone control but its also more expensive But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting The DS1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal I dont know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same pricerange Great for oldtime distortion,positive
They costed twice as much as my usual DAddarios but after 2 weeks of use I couldnt be any happier Ive heard only positive reviews about these Elixir strings and now understand why They are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright clean and crisp They also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier A great buy overall Amazing smooth clean strings,positive
Reputedly the Joyo Us Dream is a copy of the Suhr Riot distortion pedal After watching a side by side comparison on Youtube I decided to buy oneI would describe the Us Dream as sounding like a bright Proco Rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end It has an MXR style enclosure that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot But for 48 dollars Im happy with purchase One trick pony but I really like it,positive
This product works well but I still end up doing it the old fashion way Guess I am not a gimmick person Works well,positive
Solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder The joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material If anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts Right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place Arrived a day eRly music stand,positive

The CM2 is magnificent 1 It produces beautiful overdrive one that doesnt destroy your guitars tone 2 It has independent High and Low tone controls and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changesthus allowing for great versatility in tonemanipulation 3 It features a switch that allows you to pick between classic overdrive and an extra blast of distortion modified 4 The case is made of metal 5 It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal This pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider Digitechs TL2 Instead it produces a warm oldtime overdriven tone I love this thing Great Overdrive Pedal,positive
Ive got 5 effects hooked up to this thing It fits beautifully and powers all of them at once Have no problems with this I recommend it 5 Hooked up,positive
Simple to use works well on the Squier Strat Im not much of a guitarist so this is my first capo and I dont have anything to compare with but the quality is way up there Simple to use works well on the Squier Strat,positive

Sorry but Im not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers Its okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new And despite claims of being laundrysafe the edges began to unravel after the first wash I used with Planet Waves Restore polish and got good results but probably would not buy again Making waves,neutral
I knoew I did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room not did I want something that would tip over if I blew air on it My instructor of the guitar suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be lightweight yet sturdy to not fall over looked professional and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and purchase again I really like the stability of the one I bought A guitar holder better than a napkin holder from your kitchen table,positive
Not much to say its a pic holder that attaches to a musicmic stand and holds picsAs advertised it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my musicmic stands and it does in fact snuggly and easily hold picsWell worth the small cost Excellent,positive
I got this strap just to try something different than a nylon At first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around But after a while I found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when youre playing and will stay nice and steady while playing Those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well It is also very long longer than i thought I have it slung a little low and theres plenty of slack left on the strap So its probably long enough for Shaq to use it and still sling it as low as James Hetfield The only complaint I have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul But again it adds another feature to the strap since the thing isnt falling off anytime soon I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks its so good Also the holes are very strong and have not torn open at all which usually happens on a heavy guitar like the one I have All in all a perfect buy for the money Better than Nylon,positive
I am yet another one of those Forever Beginners when it comes to playing the guitar Never mind thatthese guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better After putting in new pegs and restringing with these stringsit sounds so much nicer More richer Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose I think that once I do this and then restring these same strings on itI will be set to goI like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of yearslets face itmy fingers get sore when playing I also have small fingers and handsI intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future useI recommend Love these guitar strings,positive
There good mics Five Stars,positive
I have been disappointed with the last EQ pedal I owned witch was a Boss GE7 it was very honkey and colored my tone to much this pedal is much more musical the layout of the essential frequencys is great plus they are lighted and very ez to see and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last for ever Great pedal very musical,positive
The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cableA little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping 3 to pin 2 with the white wire Pin 3 then ties to pin 1 with the ground wire Product shipd as expected but the listing for this item can be confusing,positive
I was using slinkys for several years but decided to give these a shot because the slinkys kept corroding so quickly Anyway these seem to hold up a little better Both sound good but these last a couple weeks longer So stock up I like them a lot better than Ernie Ball Slinkys,positive
My pet use to roam the car while driving He has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more EASY AND ACCOMMODATING,positive

This is my third Snark tuner I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear I use it on all my stringed instruments Havent tried it on a base This tuner is easy to attach and read and the price is great I have spent 60 bucks on tuners that do not function as well Easy Reader,positive
I havent measured signal throughput so I cant comment on that But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle This thing simply will not crimp will not kink up on itself does not get twisted and has no tension in it Its the easiest handling cable Ive ever dealt with a real pleasure when youve got all kinds of wires running all over Its like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connectionsI have a 10footer with one rightangle connection and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster Easy to handle,positive
These seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which I will appreciate for a long while Rock On Know strings attached,positive

I have used these type of clip on Tuners for quite some time and have 4 different brandsThe SNARK however is absolutely THE BEST clip on tuner Ive seen on the entire market and the price isperfect Theyve come out with the SN8 I hear which Ill buy soonGreat ProductDont leave home without it The BEST clip on Tuner,positive
The so called lower priced brother to the enormous Line 6 FBV Shortboard MKII pedal while cut down still has a lot of the same features Same quality build Self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp a real nice feature One less power supply to hook up Foot switches are easy to use Built in tuner works great The volumewah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press Programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp sounds and have them instantly available when you play either at home or on stage A good compliment to a line 6 amp,positive
If you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list With the price of 9volt batteries you cant afford not to purchase this rig If you need it theres enough wiring to have space between your pedals But the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board A great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the 9volt adapter The 9volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position STANDARD EQUIPMENT,positive
Like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa I also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to 34mark34 everything that comes into contact with the floor So needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my 700 Dean from Hell I had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar hoping that they would all arrive at the same time so I was unaware at how heavy the Dean was This one looked sturdy enoughand it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweighthollowbody electricBut the fact that I had to bend out the pegs just a smidge so the end knobs wont chew up the neck when trying to accessstore the guitar had me doubting the longterm durability of this product Dont need to come home 6 months from now find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room It should hold up long enough for me to order the Hercules Once I get the Hercules Ill be using this mount for my Rock Band guitar controller It is what it is,positive
This hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar It holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall Very Secure,positive
This little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments Just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds Ive even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitchPros Deadon accurate You can easily set your intonation with this little monster Works great in extremely loud environments Clips on tightly If you dont jump around like an orangutan on stage you could probably have the Snark ride your headstock through the whole show You dont have to plug into it Extremely responsive Enough display detail for you to know when youre getting close to in tune not just 3 indicators like some tuners flat deadon sharp Very inexpensiveCons A little twitchy on the open low B string on bass I use the 12th fret harmonics first partial to tune however since its a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more so this has never really been a problem for meInexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case for every instrument you own Best litte tuner ever bar none,positive
This mic works great for recording vocals on my Mac using Garage Band I also wanted to use it on my Xbox 360 to play Guitar Hero and Rock Band but its not recognized by either game as a mic That was surprising since its a USB mic It is a tiny mic itll fit completely on your palm but it can record very loud noises very clearly It is also very sensitive when set to room recording Excellent product Great little mic but it wont work on Xbox 360,positive
works great Just clip it on and jam outforget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one youll be happier trust me excellent,positive
The design of this product is innovative and excellent I havent used it for as long as I would generally like before writing Amazon reviews of purchased items and so cannot testify to its reliability but suffice to say that for the price it would be hard to beatThe display is very clear and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous I wonder how I ever lived without it beforeFor live gigs playing electric I would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable as noisy environments probably wouldnt be ideal for this tuner This is more for your parlor acoustic setup Brilliant design,positive
Frankly Id never heard of a pop filter until my popping ps and bs came into consciousness at the same time that this device popped into my field of view on an Amazon web page Ill bet that a couple of layers of womens nylon stockings would be just as effective but this contraption pretty much purges your elocution of the offensive phonemes theyre called plosives Im still hearing the s phonemes sibilants along with some guttural artifacts back vowels prefaced by an h that ignite a momentary gargling effect but this filter doesnt purport to be able to do anything about those buggersAs for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generoussized screws etc Im prepared to say that this one is fairly valued I doubt that the Shure or Blue pop filters at almost double the price offer anything more than brandname status The hardware and buildquality are about as solid and heavyduty as you could wish for I know Ill never be able to blow it away Unfortunately the clamp seems designed to fit on a mic stand rather than a computer screen which is almost a halfinch too thick May as well pop for it,positive
I have these on 5 of my guitars now with my acoustic and a 34novelty34 guitar being the exceptions I cant stand the thought of not using these after seeing too many expensive guitars hit the floor after the straps let loose Other styles have a button which seems more convenient but the Schaller locks are pull style which is far more secure if something bumps the end of the lock These are the only locks Ill use now Wont play without them,positive
I find that if I play this pedal along with my Boss Super Chorus pedal my guitar with TexMex pickups captures a lot Gilmours sound tonality I like the sound of this pedal,positive
This is far more pedal than I need but what a fun pedal to have Just going through the presets was fun but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner The bad part about this pedal is that it is HUGE and will take up a lot of space on your board You have to be committed to dealy Youll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches I cant comment on the looper as I never used it Huge Fun Can Download Preset from Website,positive
This tremelo pedal works nicely and its great when youre playing through an amp without tremelo Problem solved The price was also very good Nice tremelo peday,positive
These mics are great I wasnt sure what they would be like but I would buy them all again They are cheap enough to replace and they sound great We Shure mics and they needed repaired all the time These have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all These are really good mics,positive
Ive purchased many Snark tuners For my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use Very stable and they make tuning a joyThis new Snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read My one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use I have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it They need to rethink the designBut overall I like it Ill still keep my older Snarks and continue to use this one as well Its a Snark,positive
this pedal is terrificit is not a pedal to make you sound like an AC30the name is somewhat misleadingalthough you can certainly eq your sound in that directionthe real treat is the huge variety of boost tone and gain you can dial inits mindbendingthe gain is superbnot mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamerthis pedal is an audio swiss army knife so many sounds,positive
I started with the flimsy grays A couple years ago I switched to yellows Recently Ive been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the For all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this Your used to using big picks which strum hard easily With these I noticed I have to strum in a tighter stronger pattern than before to get the same tones Anyway the attack on this pick is so justYES It flows in sweeps like YES I will never switch from the pick Oh ya the grip is perfect Havent popped one outa my fingers yet Just my two cents Also changed from Dunlop yellow 73mm,positive
Its very thin all parts about it are kinda thin and cheap but it works exactly as it should Not bad if you just need to round out an order to get free shipping Not for your favorite guitar though more of a beginners or a throwaway gig strap Works like a strap,neutral
Ive been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far I use it boost my jazz bass to the same volume level as my precision It does the job perfectly The LED is REALLY bright which for me is a good thing but others might find distracting Also it would convenient if there were external switches instead of internal dip switches for varying the settings but in such a small footprint there are bound to be tradeoffs Id buy this again for sure does the job really well in a compact attractive package,positive
My husband got these and they dont get dirty as quickly which is a plus Initially the sounds arent as clear as the uncoated ones but it wears off after a couple of hours of play and you wouldnt know the difference Hell buy them again No difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind Coated strings,positive
I am a LONG time user of the big Fender triangular picks I play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in Columbus Ga I play mainly a Martin HD28 but also have a Blueridge BR180 and a Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce I bought a set of these to try them outWhile I have nothing negative to say about these picks I still prefer my big Finders I guess Im just too used to the big pick While I was playing Katy Daley with one of these Tortex picks I found that my index finger was hitting the strings on occassionIf you havent been tainted for the big Fender picks then try out a set of these I guess I could get used to them but will stick with the big Fenders for now Nice picks,positive
i do like this for playing at home but it is what it is is by no means a replacement for my 1534 tnt peavey but works as it says and the shipping was quick great amp,positive
These locking tuners are perfect for any Strat or Tele I have an American Strat and an American Tele that both came with fairly decent nonlocking tuners I also have a Carvin and two Paul Reed Smith guitars that came with locking tunersthey are certainly worth having Fenders at least Americanmade ones are very easy to swap out tuners for thesethe holes are already there theres no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself Ive swapped out the tuners and have never looked backthe only question is what to do with the nonlocking Fender tuners I have now Perfect upgrade for any Strat or Tele,positive

These speakers worked great for 14 months Last week 4813 one of them wouldnt power up all the way The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them and its just a matter of time before it stops working It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews I took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week I contacted MAudios online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops One on the East coast and one on be west coast Ive since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the MAudio support site MAudio doesnt stand behind their products and Ill never purchase anything from them again Worked great for 14 months,negative
this is my first petal of any kind I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that glad I did this Wah petal is so much fun you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow It is hours and hours of fun the sounds are great I have had no problem with performance it works as it should I highly recommend this petal its price is attractive as well I love it works great so many possibilities,positive

I purchased this mic to use for screencasts recording whats happening on my PCs screen while I talk about it I set it up to sit on my desktop approximately 2 away from me and usedCamtasia Studio 8 Download and a free program called CamStudio to test it out Both programs worked well with the mic and did what Id hoped it would do eliminated my need for a clunky wired mic headsetThe build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic I love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptops monitorKINKS IN MY SYSTEM MUFFLED AUDIOThe included software Cakewalks Music Creator LE can be installed on one computer You get 30 days to register it I installed it and registered it immediately but it would not allow me to put in my registration code saying I wasnt the system administrator I am and my Windows 7 PC says I am but alas it wouldnt work This software is optional but I decided to install it prior to the microphone per instructions to try it out Eventually I ended up uninstalling itSoon after installing Cakewalk I had a PC issue muffled audio recording No amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it I was stumpedThen I decided to go to the Samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic The generic ones installed were from 2010 No luckI began reading online about muffled audio on Windows 7 PCs Somewhere I noticed a name I recognized RealTek which was a name associated with my speakers on my PC RealTek digital audio I went to the RealTek site and noted updated drivers for Windows 7 64bit 2012 and decided to download and install them I rebooted my PC and tested out the audio recording once more Much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problemI did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording Afterwards I tested out the mic using Camtasia and CamStudio both worked beautifully with the Samson Go MicOn my desk at a distance of about 25 this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts No hiss hum breath noises or distortion Very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio works perfectly with the USB 20 connection on my powered USB hubCONCLUSION BUY IT FOR GREAT RECORDINGSThis mic is a truly great if its recognized and properly configured by your system Impressively clear recordings unlike any Ive been able to obtain using aPlantronics Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headsetor the mic on myMicrosoft LifeCam Cinema 720p HD Webcam BlackFor the price I dont think you can do better Its compact has great voice pickup and audio recording clarity Installation issues may occur but updating audio drivers using a powered USB hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality youve been hoping for at a price thats rightUPDATE 123013Been using this mic consistently for a couple months and Im liking it Its a condenser mic and doesnt filter out ambient noise as well as Id like however for an under forty dollar purchase Im still very happy with it Cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so I uninstalled it I guess if anything thats been the downside to this purchase Problems with Win 7 audio drivers but once resolved stellar performance,positive
I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musicians Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought so I went on the hunt for very thin picks The celluloid one fell apart quickly so I wanted a better materialThese white nylon picks should last a lot longer The nonpointed end is all grippy textured so it doesnt work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick but it does the job and I like it The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely but you can still pick with it if youre combining picking and strummingIll keep using thicker picks for pickingonly songs and for louder strumming but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house these are greatUPDATE Ive been using them for more than a year now and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostlystrumming song but you can do it This is still my favorite pick for strumming Hope this helps Just what I was looking for,positive
This is my 6th Kyser capo This one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 is what I needed I always recommend all Kyser CaposThey last forever and do not lose the strong holds Kyser Caps Are An Easy Recommendation,positive
This capo is lightweight and really tough it is stiff and takes some strength to open but it stays in place and doesnt damage the necks of my guitars Ive used this on acoustic electric 7 string 12 string and a lot of 6 string guitars and it always works perfectly I think its a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly Great Capo Really Tough,positive
As the digital realm and the audio realm become one things like these will become increasingly rare You will always find a place that does not keep up with the times thoughThat alone is a good enough reason to keep stuff like this around for now Another decent adapter,neutral
Planet Waves Classic Leather Guitar Strap Black is good productIts soft and pretty and looks nice with my StratRecommend it Planet Waves Classic Leather Guitar Strap Black,positive

A booster makes your signal louder That has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like MXR Micro Amp EHX LPB1 BBE Boosta Grande Modtone etc They keep your guitars original tone make it louder and when pushed enough will add a good amount of gain grit But there is something else going on with the Xotic EP Booster Yes it also makes the signal louder adds gain or a little dirt but also makes your overall sound bigger wider Based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like Jimmy Page Duane Allman Gary Moore etc This pedal is really small in size has one knob the footswitch It does have an internal dip switch You open up the back of the pedal choose you own setting I leave at the classic setting turn the gain knob at 9 or 10 oclock leave it on all the time I tried it before after my OD pedals and my personal preference is after Being in front of the amp it didnt do much when I tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp I put it in the FX loop it boosted the signal alright but I didnt like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my OD pedalsThis is one pedal that will stay on my board I doesnt take up much space built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better It does one job only but it does it so well The Best Booster,positive
old good design For the price Ive bought 4 of them and just put it on all guitars so wouldnt have to search for pick again good product,positive
I purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgies as an addon to a larger order As such I found them to be a reasonable value However Im not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic I think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or uke They are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfortI love the very soft warm sound they provide I use them mostly late at night when I cant sleep and want to play but the rest of the family is still sleeping Not quite as effective on the E A and D steel strings but certainly playable Not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords ThanksSPO Warm soft tone similar to a felt pick,positive
This is a great stand In the past I have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made This one serves the bill I am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable It is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use I use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased Solid,positive
What a great little stand I love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings I also like the fact it folds up taking up very little space when its stored away The rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic so theres no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck Perfect For Guitar Cleaning And String Changes,positive
Very comfortable The soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish Heavy duty but soft on the shoulder Not cheap quality at all This will definitely last a long time Worth every penny,positive
i love these strings i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these i really enjoyed them after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase no desire to test other strings especially after this bundlevalue this is a good value,positive
Im sure these strings are fine I like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my Jackson Rose These however or the high E the Jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it Because with a Jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings I was left with worthless strings my mistake Just not for one of my electrics my mistake but I do love the other strings they offer So im out four bucks oh well Im sure there good strings,positive
I bought these primarily because they are so cheap The quality is good I would say not great but not terrible either They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull They dont last nearly as long as Elixirs but then again they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs I would recommend these for practice no gigging with these as the sound isnt quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want For the price though its hard to knock on them too much Good strings nothing more nothing less,positive
Behringer has done it again The PP400 UltraCompact Phono Preamp is exactly what it looks likeIts ultracompact It takes up a very negligible amount of space It will sit comfortably between a turntable and another componentIn its compactness though it does NOT sacrifice usability It has no trouble amplifying a turntables signal to line level Before buying a preamp amp could only boost my turntable to a easy listening level The noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary With the help of this preamp my amp no longer acts as a crutch and I can comfortably listen to music without my amps Im turned up to 11 and struggling noiseThe build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point Its not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal This makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look It also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interferenceUnfortunately there is no option to buy it in black Judging from the accessible screws on the side though it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if I wantedThis preamp also does not have a power switch but this is not much of an issue Its one small complaint on an otherwise amazing productSummaryIf you need a preamp buy this one It has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps Cheap Compact Effective,positive
Works great I didnt use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws Next time Im buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I dont have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars For now Im hanging one on the wall with this and its fine Wood is nice quality I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center Good wall hanger if you want to hang a couple guitars,positive
Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the difference with the POP filter on right away Good investment Definitely an improvement,positive
This is a great music stand Very solid feel No need to over tighten the adjusters It holds my heaviest books without tipping over Solid Stand,positive
Far better than any light weight chrome stand this has guts Easily adjustible knobs tighten easily and firmly Good height adjustment for sitting or standing Highly reccomend this stand Super stand,positive
I put this in my Fender MIM Stratocaster I want to change that 34poor34 string guides that came in MIM by the American Series string guide So nice Great acessories,positive
This works better than the QK10B model by the same company Slim and easy to install though longer than the QK10B Since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts you might have to rotate a mic boom etc to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts My use was for an IPad clamp attached to a mic stand It worked well and I put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag This unit wiggles a little but not as much as the QK10B so the little bit of movement is acceptable This looks to be well built and should be reliable The long haul will be the test A good design and mostly positive,positive
After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfectionInstead I got a decent set of 10s that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings and I prestretch them gently but completely Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons so I break very few of my normal strings Slinky 10s Ergo a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension tuned down is unacceptable especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric stringsAs for the tone its definitely bright and almost too edgy but nicely zingy all told Yet one negative Ive noticed after about 8 hours loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings making them harder to tune Sounds odd I know but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D replacing singles aint cheap either at triple the price please note Ive since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir stringsSo I must say Im summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric stringsWhats the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fastEspecially when it costs three times moreAnd whats up with the tuning thingAnd why do these cost so much more anyhow Is a microthin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes zero doubt thereAnyhow Ive got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now so as they age Ill get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone and Ill report back here in a while And by the way that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs tonally So much for Magic Elixir ToneDont get me wrong I really do want to love these as I hate changing strings but geez guys how about some quality controlIf Im going to pay triple the price then is it crazy to expect triple the quality Or heck even just a little betterPS If you look at the DAddario reviews I love their acoustic strings they respond to many of the reviews and questions I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questionsEdit And now after only six hours of playing on that guitar the B string popped at the same place as the D neck pickup Once again I ask what good are strings that sound good three times longer if they break three times fasterEdit 103112 Come on After four more hours the A string went I only play that ax one or two sessions a week and the next time I joked to the drummer Which one will go today He said hes amazed the G is still on as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension An hour later guess what Yep So thats four broken strings in less than 20 hours play SeriouslyNot only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks Id be bummed if they cost 3 bucks The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new but dang unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such Id stick with Slinkies or DAddarios Unless I got a bad set which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price In any case these Elixirs were just not worth the moneyEdit 3313 I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage and they sent me another set That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet thought the tuning issue remains Ill add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud But honestly at this price there should be no duds at all Not very impressed so far,neutral
For years I was lugging around a large rack case with my Mackie board and a host of rack effects reverb delay compressors etc While using the rack I had a line from my programmable guitar effects pedal Boss that went to a rack compressor then out to my little Vox amp the internal compressor in my Boss ME30 pedal was terrible I was very happy with this set up for about 10 years but about a year ago I stopped using the rack smaller clubs and places with too many stairs Since then I went to a smaller PA Soundcraft Gigarac and some active Mackie speakersand started using that terrible compressor in the otherwise decent Boss pedal A few months ago I took out my old box of effects pedals and built a small pedal board This worked great but I couldnt locate my old Ibanez CS9 compressor and years ago I know gave away my MXR I needed a compressor pedal for my new pedal board that worked as well as the AlesisSeems like I found a winner This MXR clone from Behringer seems to work as well if not better than the MXR and is much quieter Some people have mentioned a slight bump on the upper mids of the compressed signal and I agree that it is there but its not hiss or added noise and I like the sound My main guitar is a mid 90s Epiphone Sheriton and it sounds great through the Behringer DC9 I cant comment of the durability because I havent had it that long but the case is metal and everything feels solid I dont crank up the compression too much and I leave the pedal on about 90 of the time to control the overall signal from my pedal board My pedals in order Ibanez TS9 Ibanez Super Tube a 1984 pedal that was made between the TS9 and TS10 a cheap chorus pedal Ibanez DE7 delay into a Behringer DR600 ReverbFor 2400 this compressor does just what its supposed to do Its a two knob sqeezer just like old MXR and just works No need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings Two knobs one to set the overall compression and one to adjust the output volume Great simple pedal clean soundUpdate I have had this pedal now for about 1 12 years I notice one reviewer said that the bass sound dropped out on his guitar signal with this pedal I have to admit that this is true Its not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable This pedal is not something that I would use too heavily it does a nice job compressing peaks and overall range and gives you a nice smooth sound If you are looking for a guitar pedal to sustain the sound you may want to look at other pedals This is just a basic compressor not a true sustainer and at high levels it will probably make you sound very thin as the compression ratio gets above 3540 or higher On the other hand most stomp pedal compressors under 8010000 will do pretty much the same thing My Alesis rack compressor will knock the punch out of a signal at high levels also The sound is clean but its best used for a little compression not the huge amounts needed to call it a sustainer Try the Behringer CS400 for more sustain Does a nice job for peanuts,positive
Havent got to far into this thing yet but I do like it Same classic behringer plastic housing that I personally never had problems with Definitely get some odd tone change to work with here Id say check your YouTube channel to hear for yourself if not familiar with the tones Early review,positive
It fits well on my Les Paul and Strat Does Not fly off the head when playing Its very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting The light works really well and that was what I was looking for As far as accuracy its right on in either setting Good to have,positive
Ive been playing in bands since 1969 and have used every wireless ever invented and this beats them all hands down The best wireless,positive
This really cleans your strings Its fast with a couple of swipes and a lint free towel strings are clean It comes with a little towel inside the cap but not very efficient ok if you need it quick somewhere else Not worth knocking it down for a little towel so Im sticking with the 5 star Easy and works,positive
Solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag There isnt really much in the way of instructions but the LEDs are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out Does what it is supposed to,positive
This Review is for the JOYO CRUNCH DISTORTION I have a few ODs including a OCD a fuzz and a modded Rat but thought for 30 bucks from Crazy Cart this might be a cool distortion pedal And it is Its very articulate and gives you good Marshally 70s80s crunch Cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound Its almost ODish in its responsiveness Its not super heavy distortion though Im a bluesclassic rock guy and itll do fine for heavy classic rock distortion but its not a modern metal pedal For the price its amazing I really love it Im so impressed with this pedal that Ive ordered the Sweet Baby and will probably get a couple of others while theyre still cheap Love it,positive
These work great Its hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time You have a strap You have a guitar This locks them together But these do work really well Compared to other brands I find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers Downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered by me to be aesthetically pleasing But this is true for most strap lock systems So I say go for it Yes Easy to use and fun for the whole family,positive
Since this is the third hanger I have purchased it goes without saying that I really like it My only criticism is that it ships with mounting hardware that is for a 34brick34 wall I am fairly sure that 90 of those of us that use these hangers mount them on a plasterboard wall How about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall Otherwise a great hanger that I trust for use with my expensive guitarsIm just running out of wall space and money for new guitars Number 3 and still counting,positive
Ill be honest here I bought this one primarily because of its looks Not a lot of white clipon tuners around I also own an SN8 and in comparing the two the SN13 seems to be as tight but its only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the SN8 which has more features for a few dollars less than what youre paying for the SN13 Still its a typical Snark It registers very quickly its easy to read and you dont have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration The stem on mine is a little looser than I would prefer but it still stays in positionMy only real gripe isnt unique to this model but to all Snarks The curved stem combined with the round head means it wont sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems arent exactly robust so Im always concerned that one day Im going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces Other than that Id recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner Pretty good clipon tuner,positive
This is the cheapest and most effective way of saving a lot of money in wasted 9v batteries that will always run out on a gig rather than when it doesnt matter Linked to the power supply which is still cheaper than any of the 9v ones supplied by the manufacturer Save a bomb,positive
This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hihat pedal but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top This allows you to either ride closed hihats when using both bass pedals yet return to normal hihat playing when the music calls for itBe aware that this clutch has only two positions open and fully closed However there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hihats in the closed position for a sizzle sound I did a work around by placing a spring on the hihat stem with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound However this is all personal preference and many drummers ride a fully closed hihat anyway which makes this clutch perfect out of the boxRegardless of your hihat style if you are using a double bass this is a must have accessory Gibraltars model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time Essential for double bass pedal players,positive
As a new guitar player I have a lot to learn and after nearly dropping my guitar twice in about 15 minutes because the strap sliding off the pegs research was needed Based on reviews here and other sites I ordered these Arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised Would buy these again ifwhen I acquire new guitars Works as advertised,positive
The DP008EX Pocketstudio is the next generation design of the DP03 Digital Portastudio I have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the DP008EX on its own terms pointing out features and issues important to me mostly workflowrelated as someone who grew up homerecording with analog equipmentIf you want all the details of the full functionality Id recommend downloading the manual from TASCAM or a dealer site that offers itSpeaking of the manual I found it to be essential at least at first There are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy or better yet downloading a second copy is a good ideaThis is picky but I found the larger size of the DP03 manual easier to read and handle than the smaller DP008EXIve used softwarebased DAWs for years and while I enjoy MIDI recording mixing and editing with them basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when I used analog equipment I have a oneroom home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and aside from PC noise I miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old MKII cassette 4track Instant power on press recordpause readysetgo Granted I dont miss the wall of hiss that plagued those recordings but I had fun capturing a lot of musical momentsUsing a hardware control surface with my DAW didnt solve the problem I just find the reality of booting Windows dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment especially when recording acoustic instrumentsI hoped the DP008EX would provide some of that older experience with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setupThe bottom line for me is It does and it doesntFirst some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptionsSizewise the difference between Porta and Pocket studios is roughly 11 12 x 2 x 8 inches versus 8 34 x 1 34 x 5 inches TASCAM doesnt provide a case or cover for the DP008EX but a larger eReader or tablet case should do fine and Id recommend one if you plan on portable use the plastic appears fairly durable but its still plasticThe knobs on the DP008EX are smaller in diameter lower and have rounded tops compared to those on the DP03 However I find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip I also find the smaller circular pushbuttons on the DP008EX dont protrude above the surface as much as the larger barshaped buttons on the DP003 and are less comfortable to useThe data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the DP008EX which I prefer the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menusYoull need the dedicated PSP520 5v power supply for the DP008EX the 12v PS1225L for the DP03 cant be shared The plug wont fit so you cant fry it and dont even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously On the other hand the Teac RC3F footswitch is sharable youll need a mini plug to phone adaptor but I think its indispensable if youre working aloneSpeaking of power a strong plus for both recorders and for me a dealbreaker were it not present is phantom mic power so youre not limited to the builtin stereo condensers Theyre not bad for rough work but unlike mic standmounted portables it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals I can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a goodsounding room but for close mic recording of guitar acoustic or electric amp violin or percussion I want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality micsI like the resistance of the faders on the DP03 but I can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the DP008EX Theres no CD burner either on the smaller unit but with USB 20 transfer capability thats not an issue for meHaving similar XLR phono and RCA jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste Im not bothered by it because I have space to run the cables but its worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for youThe LED screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issuesThe flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be especially since the menu is used so much A slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble I do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at 25 degrees and doesnt interfere with jack access it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use TASCAM should consider a similar accessoryThe software is largely the same for both units aside from additional mastering tools essentially packaged presets and here lies my major criticism I feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality ie levels EQ arming tracks with dedicated knobs and buttons and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what I see is an inflexible constraining menu systemIf there were some way to customize the menu navigation the equivalent of software hotkeys its possible the frequent repetition of nonfunctional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they doThe best evidence of an unbalanced design I see is the dedicated Phantom power button on both units whose purpose is to display the Phantom screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off That crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between softwarebased recording and using a dedicated hardware recorderWhen space for knobs and buttons is severely limited I can understand the design thinking and tradeoffs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu But the DP008EX is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multitracker a Fostex X15 effectively doubledup the functionality of two tracks to cover four So I have to question whether the tradeoffs TASCAM made here in fact diminish the user experienceWith connectivity and softwarebased recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving I believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the DP008EX will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience I think TASCAM would be wellserved taking that into accountIve always liked the design of TASCAM gear it just looks and feels wellmade and thats still in large part true of the DP008EX But I cant help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old MKII cassette 4track would satisfy a lot of people out there and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off Good Quality But Some Awkward Design Choices Like Its Predecessor,positive
This is actually the first capo I have ever owned as I am pretty new to playing the guitar That being said I paid close to 14 with free shipping for this capo and I feel it is a good value It feels well constructed like it wont break if I drop it The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitars neck The spring mechanism is plenty tight but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed even while playing The capo is sleek looking and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 334 x 334 but I have no frame of reference for comparisonItem was shipped on time and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging Part number 83CB Made in USA No counterfeit here If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can Thanks for readingSPO Lets call it 45 stars,positive
I cant believe I never thought of buying colored cables before I often move all my microphones from one drum set to another depending on what Im recording and now I dont have to use masking tape and write what each microphone is for I can just look at the color and Im all set These are awesome,positive
Ok I understand it now I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy read cheap interface to record some instruments with WRONG I am returning it It does not work has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac my Mac finds everything Bought the Focusrite unit instead Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings Save your money and time Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others Yes over 100 but you either want feedback hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance It also lacks 14 plug one rca input you need an addapter Not what I thought I was getting dumb me Does not work,negative
I have used this pedal on both myRoland RD300NX Digital Pianoand myRoland VCombo VR700and its one hundred percent compatible with both One nice feature that ensures compatibility is the polarity switch that enables it to work with just about any brand and model keyboardIts well constructed and I have not encountered any issues with the twopiece bottom In fact after over a year of use on carpet issues reported by another have not surfaced If anything this pedal is as good as newThe feel is superb There is positive resistance as you depress the pedal and the spring tensions it in such a manner that you can control exactly the rate of depression or release It is not so tight as to fatigue but the response is positiveAnother feature I love is the six foot cord length it gives you room to place the pedal when you have tiered keyboards and multiple pedals on the floor The cable itself and the plug look to be high quality and have withstood over a year of constant use with no problemsIf you are looking for an inexpensive but not cheaply made pedal that will work with just about any keyboard this one is worth considering I am sold on it and would replace it with an identical pedal if something happens to this one Excellent construction and performance,positive
This little tuner is so easy to use and seeI bought two more as presents The price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner If you dont have a tuner or are looking for a new one you NEED this one A Snark SN2 tuner,positive
I bought a number of these because after the first one I used I fell in love They have a fuller sound than other picks and the grip on these is fool proof However they dont pinch harmonics well at all and they will not do scrapes up the Low strings at all Two disasters for Classic rock music I never seen picks that wouldnt do these things however I really struggled with these things that seem so easy with other picks However minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks Great Pick,positive
Great for a beginner electricNeeded new strings but everything else was smoothPick up a set of slinky strings and all is well Great look and play for an intro electric,positive

Very nice design It can holds all the my guitars with no issues The lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured the best,positive
Works well for my needs It adjusts and holds whatever microphone I use in position very well A good buy I would recommend it for light to moderate use Works Just Fine,positive
WOW If you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbingthe tc electronics DITTO pedal will not disappoint I have been exploring the fringes and outer limits of guitar FX for over 30 years and this one has in just two days become one of my Top Five Gotta Have effects It is so simple that a five year old could make great loops and it add ZERO addition sound to your signal Placed at the end of your pedalboard which is easy to do because of the DITTOs tiny footprint the possibilities for live stunts and grooves is mindblowing And you cant beat the price Ive uploaded a 5m workout that I recorded on my 2nd day using the DITTO if youd like to hear it a solo improvisation for Telecaster and reverb WOW If you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbing,positive
great picks i like the feel and the control it provides i like its texture and the size just perfect perfect picks,positive
The main advantage of this recorder to me is that I can get a good result without knowing muchIve made some surprisingly good recordings of choir concerts in various venues without any special knowledge though Im sure knowing more would make my recording sound betterAbout the only thing you should absolutely learn is to set the mic gain correctly so you dont overpower the mic I dont use auto gainIf anything I try to err on the side of low Excellent low noise property of the unit means that except some rare cases I can just boost the sound later on PC and the result is still more than passable for my purpose Good recording is possible without knowing much,positive
This little unit is packed with great effects For 50 Im very impressed Has just about everything you need in a entrylevel pedal except for a pedal control Just keeps getting better,positive
I saw this tuner in the local music store for 30 and decided to order it here for 11 Within 5 minutes I had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect I compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical I honestly expected some variance but it was dead on I have never heard my guitar sound so good I am super impressed with this little thing If ever I need another one this is the only one I will get AWESOME TUNER,positive
I really like the mediums They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough What I expected,positive
Pay a couple bucks more and you get one from a brand like Audio Technica and you know its going to withstand the test of time Mine is working fairly well but the attachments are loosening so who knows whats next Does the job but there are better quality ones out there,positive
Completely quite Connected with no problem I own two Great,positive
This is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings It is like the swiss army knife for string winding Super practical,positive
I bought this effect because I saw a few YouTube demos that made it look pretty good I had always wanted an attack delay effect and the Behringer Slow Motion was priced well below all competitors When it arrived I tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope It only works well under these circumstances All notes must be played slowly individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in You cant play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly Having said that I found that the effect is nice once you have mastered the technique I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all Other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal which I have not tried I considered returning the unit to Amazon for a refund but I dont think that would be fair as it DOES work to some extent and it didnt cost me a lot of money in the first place However I do not think I would recommend it to a friend Not bad but not great either,neutral
bought this on a whim and I am glad of it I have not used the string winder part yet but the cutter makes short work of both guitar and mandolin strings without the risk of marring the head just be careful you can pinch yourself if you are not careful does what it says,positive
Works well and has good sound I really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds The interface could be easier to use but for this price point one cant really complain cool,positive
Nothing fancy about this strap unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end Just well made and functionalI got this for my grandsons Squier by Fender 34 size acoustic It doesnt have a strap button at the top end It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand Simple but nice,positive
I just got these in and I have to say very disappointed Its as if I went into a boys shop and bought a large shirt and expected it to fit a man What do they call medium or small This large pick barely goes over my thumbnail area I can hold it sort of so well see how well it works with my hybrid plectrum project BTW Im an average grown man 57 165 More to comeHere we go a few months later I just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a large thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick Bottom line if you want a thumb pick that fits go to a store and try before you buy Good luck to all Large means thickness of the plastic,neutral
If you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about 20 then this kit is for you Changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack A great way to spruce up a guitar,positive
I definitely enjoy these and I highly recommend them They are used by other artists that approve of them Slash from Guns n Roses uses them Great Strings,positive
Good Plenty of gain on hand Lots of sustainThis thing can get really loud It gives yourinexpensive tube amp that Marshall crunchBuilt well its casing is made out of metal not plasticInexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing 3 times as much If youre lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal forget the Boss DS1 andget this one Well worth the moneyBad Adds a little noise hiss specially to single coils strats telesYou might need to use a noise gate to tame the noiseQuieter with humbuckers but hums when I use it with my Xotic EP Booster whichI always keep on It doesnt happen when I boost my overdrives OCD Hardwire CM2If you move farther away from your amp the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise I guess this is typical for distortion boxesNo need to boost it though it already has that thick big sound to start withIt didnt come with a 9V battery as shipped not a big deal cause I use a poweradapter anyway Excellent distortion,positive
I was loking for a particular sound that I jsut couldnt find with lighter strings This set was perfect and I was able to recreate the sound Iwas looking for Heavy retro sound,positive
i use thin picks 38 46 and 50 so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i dont use i actually like the dunlop brandmaterial so once i get used to thicker ones ill try these the pack only have 50 and thicker in case youre looking for very thin ones if so then dont buy this sample pack go and buy the Dunlop Nylon 38 or 46 sure for trying out others,neutral
I had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk and since it was off to the side made it tuff to watch the level meters This clampon boom serves the purpose but has a hard time holding the weight of my Shure KSM 32 condenser mic I tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it to keep it from sagging Very affordable and I found a work around for the weight issue I wouldnt recommend this if youre doing a lot of recording but it is sufficient for my home studio A little flimsy,neutral
I needed a solid throne to replace my IKEA computer stool Ive been saddled with for the past year The stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should I dont have any long term usage to report but Ive seen reviews complaining the stool eventually loosens and will rotate which would be annoying if true But at this fairly low price point you cant complain about much and its better than the real cheap thrones Solid throne,positive
What can I say about a guitar strap It fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price Nice Strap,positive
Well constructed with quality woods saddlenut and bracing Neck and frets are straight level and do not snag This guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play The strings may be too high or too light or whatever just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well Do not buy a Luna Davidson Main Street or any other no name get this one best bang for the money,positive
